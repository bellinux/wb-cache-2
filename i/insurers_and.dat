5|$|However, {{the premium}} tax credits are {{mandatory}} spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive them without Congressional appropriation. These adjust with premium increases to limit after-subsidy premium payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income. Based on President Trump's threats {{to end the}} CSR payments during early 2017, several <b>insurers</b> <b>and</b> actuarial groups estimated {{this resulted in a}} 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year.

5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} the doctors and <b>insurers</b> <b>and</b> {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity. After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E

40|$|People {{are more}} distrustful {{of managed care}} {{organizations}} (MCOs) than traditional health plans, a phenomenon that {{has become known as}} "managed-care backlash. " In a model of the relationship between a patient, <b>insurer,</b> <b>and</b> physician, this paper shows that when the roles of <b>insurer</b> <b>and</b> provider are combined into a single player (as in a staff-model HMO), the equilibrium insurance plan departs from the social optimum, {{due to the fact that}} the HMO cannot credibly commit to providing non-least-cost care. In contrast, when the <b>insurer</b> <b>and</b> provider roles are separate, as in fee-for-service insurance, the equilibrium reimbursements for the physician implement the first-best treatment regime at first-best cost. Thus, the relative inability of MCOs to commit to non-least-cost care may account for at least part of managed-care backlash. ...|$|R
40|$|The stop-loss {{reinsurance}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important reinsurance contracts in the insurance market. From the insurer point of view, it presents an interesting property: it is optimal if the criterion of minimizing the variance of the cost of the insurer is used. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the analysis of the stop-loss contract in one period from the point of view of the <b>insurer</b> <b>and</b> the reinsurer. Firstly, the influence of the parameters of the reinsurance contract on the correlation coefficient between the cost of the <b>insurer</b> <b>and</b> the cost of the reinsurer is studied. Secondly, the optimal stop-loss contract is obtained if the criterion used is the maximization of the joint survival probability of the <b>insurer</b> <b>and</b> the reinsurer in one period...|$|R

25|$|A {{key feature}} of the Dutch system is that {{premiums}} may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalization and a common risk pool. Funding for all short-term health care is 50% from employers, 45% from the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US$196,) with variation of about 5% between the various competing <b>insurers,</b> <b>and</b> deductible a year €220 (U.S. $288).|$|E
25|$|After Georgian independence, the {{government}} found that its Soviet-style centralized healthcare system was underfunded and failing. State-run centralized medical facilities were typically inefficient {{and in need}} of renovation and technological upgrades. As a result, {{the government}} privatized almost all public hospitals and clinics, and the insurance system was deregulated, with private insurance companies able to offer coverage. Only a few specialized facilities for mental health and infectious diseases remained in government hands, and the state continued to provide health insurance for those below the poverty line, whose insurance was paid for by public funds and provided by private <b>insurers,</b> <b>and</b> some civil servants, amounting to about 40% of the population. As a result, the level of healthcare greatly improved, with new hospitals and clinics beginning to replace older facilities. However, a portion of the population was uninsured, as it could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for public insurance.|$|E

25|$|The {{high cost}} of health care in the United States is {{attributed}} variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the full cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private <b>insurers</b> <b>and</b> drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.|$|E
