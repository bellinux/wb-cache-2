5|$|According to German {{biologist}} Ernst Haeckel, {{the question}} of man's origin began with Linnaeus. He helped <b>future</b> <b>research</b> in {{the natural history of}} man by describing humans just as he described any other plant or animal.|$|E
5|$|Strains {{with much}} lower {{concentrations}} of gyromitrin have been discovered, and the fungus {{has been successfully}} grown to fruiting in culture. Thus there is scope for <b>future</b> <b>research</b> into cultivation of safer strains.|$|E
5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} <b>future</b> <b>research</b> {{will fail to}} find a {{neuronal}} basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but other philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often {{necessary in order to}} open the minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations.|$|E
40|$|If {{there is}} one {{activity}} that needs to stay {{up to date on}} change and innovation, it is <b>futures</b> <b>research.</b> I argue that <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> can be innovated first of all by exploring the scientific nature of <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> and then by approaching the variety of methods used in <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> in a contingent way and, finally, by making futures researchers more awar...|$|R
40|$|In {{our modern}} day society {{characterized}} by turbulence, uncertainty, and change, <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> (the science and art of {{looking to the}} future) has become a very important competence for managers, politicians, civil servants, scientists, policy-makers, and citizens. Indeed, many different methods of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> have been developed, and there is considerable scientific research available on, for instance, how <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> {{can and should be}} applied, how <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> can be connected to decision making, and how <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> can be evaluated. The increasing importance of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> makes it both interesting and necessary to look at its scientific foundations. Since <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary, this book looks at how the concept of the future (or futures) is being addressed in various scientific disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, economics, geography, and astronomy. In doing this, more knowledge is gained about the specific role the future plays in other more classical sciences, allowing <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> to position itself better vis-à-vis other sciences and make its added value clearer. In Knowing Tomorrow, well known futures researchers from around the world (e. g., Italy, the U. K., the U. S. A, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and Australia) discuss how the future is being dealt with in different sciences. They describe how scientists have incorporated the future in their theories, thereby often taking a historical perspective. The findings of this book can offer strong support to the scientific foundations of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> and thus improve <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> as a scientific discipline. [Book Synopsis...|$|R
30|$|In {{the field}} of <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> several methods have been {{developed}} for anticipating the future and for active decision making and leadership. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> methods are used in most cases to contextualize expert information and knowledge. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> methods have generally formed as a separate research field since World War II [10 – 12].|$|R
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.|$|E
5|$|Professor Pete Wilson, {{on behalf}} of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has {{suggested}} questions for <b>future</b> <b>research</b> and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument as a route or in a boundary dispute; {{and analysis of the}} site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish the extent of the monument beyond the length so far excavated.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} {{and stability of}} such subtypes over time is unknown and should {{be the subject of}} <b>future</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this article, we have {{interpreted}} basic concepts of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> in the <b>Futures</b> Map frame and suggested quality criteria of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> in that frame. It {{is possible to}} define basic concepts of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> beside the <b>Futures</b> Map frame in many other kinds of frames e.g., in the frames of various versions of the scenario approach. Anyway, we consider that the Futures Map frame is one promising possibility for {{the definition of the}} basic concepts of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> as well as its quality criteria.|$|R
30|$|Kuusi, Cuhls and Steinmüller [4] make a {{distinction}} between internal and external validity for evaluating the quality of <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> and argue that an internally valid <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> process in turn promotes valid results, i.e., external validity of the research process. The following sections outline these sets of internal and external quality criteria for <b>futures</b> <b>research.</b>|$|R

25|$|Further {{research}} with DNA analysis of Lucilia sp. would clarify discrepancies between morphological and molecular similarities. Also, <b>future</b> <b>research</b> on degree days and hours for L. mexicana would benefit investigations involving post mortem intervals.|$|E
30|$|This {{met with}} the aim of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> to not only do <b>research</b> on the <b>future</b> but also to shape it. It is thus not {{surprising}} that <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> tried to contribute its expertise to politics in the 1960 s, as will be demonstrated using the following examples of West German <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> and the Federal Government. This applied most by far to the empirical-positivist approach.|$|R
30|$|First, {{standards}} that ensure that <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> {{takes into account}} that the usual scientific procedures of verification or falsification can hardly be applied to future issues since their specific (future) subject is not accessible and requires therefore a special approach in knowledge creation. In short: The standards of this group make sure that <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> becomes really <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> distinct from other scientific pursuits.|$|R
30|$|Many {{companies}} {{believed they}} were conducting <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> when actually they were merely looking at trends in market values, stock shares, or cultural mores. For this purpose, our interdisciplinary team has created a glossary containing definitions used by the <b>Futures</b> <b>Research</b> community, and has highlighted one, streamlined definition {{which can be used}} by anyone conducting research in the field of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> (view glossary here: www.unibw.de/internationalepolitik/projekte/projekte/Zukunftsanalyse/) [7].|$|R
25|$|Currently, no {{forms of}} {{treatment}} have proven effective in treating amusia.

25|$|Military {{training}} on the campus became popular, then mandatory. WWII marked the first provision of money {{from the federal government}} to the University for research purposes. This laid a foundation for <b>future</b> <b>research</b> grants from the federal government of Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{molecular}} mimicry {{is a useful}} tool in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of autoimmune disorders. Molecular mimicry is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow <b>future</b> <b>research</b> to be directed toward uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant. This way, <b>future</b> <b>research</b> {{may be able to}} design strategies for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders. The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to molecular mimicry.|$|E
30|$|Because {{creative}} {{imagination is}} an integral ingredient of futures studies, {{it is especially important}} to define what forms of creative thinking are acceptable in scientific <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> and in which phases and frames they are acceptable. For some years, training programs in <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> have started in several European universities. The unclear position of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> in the field of sciences has seriously hindered its development towards an established discipline.|$|R
30|$|However, the Centre Berlin for <b>Futures</b> <b>Research</b> {{learned from}} these problems. A policy paper from 1975, {{composed}} {{by the new}} deputy chairperson Rainer Mackensen, a sociologist, regarded the task of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> as doing the spadework for political decision-making {{in the interests of}} the people. It conducted research, he continued, on possible developments, the extent to which they could be evaluated vis-à-vis various objectives and the extent to which they could be influenced by public decisions. Improving the life of many seemed to be much more important than the “impressive demonstration of technical capacity”. For this, <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> should use tangible social scientific, systems analytical and technical processes. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> helped to utilise the potential for a “more comprehensive consideration of public decisions” [68 Mackensen]. The distancing from the phase of model simulation is very apparent here. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> was now aimed at integrating systems analysis and modelling into a mixture of methods under the banner of a reflected, socially-orientated understanding of the “discipline”. This understanding was pragmatic because it balanced the possibilities and limits of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> and realistically assessed them.|$|R
30|$|If <b>Futures</b> <b>Research</b> is {{thinking}} ahead then <b>Futures</b> <b>Research</b> is also thinking against a ticking clock. This poses a disadvantage for static models and an advantage for dynamic models that {{are able to}} adapt with time.|$|R
25|$|The {{emerging}} view {{suggests that}} cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions. A challenge for <b>future</b> <b>research</b> {{will be to}} map the multiple brain regions that might combine {{with each other in}} a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, American {{scientists}} used {{a particle}} accelerator {{to send a}} coherent neutrino message through 780 feet of rock.

25|$|In June 2011, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) awarded Verlinde the Spinoza Prize, {{the highest}} award {{available}} to Dutch scientists including a 2.5 million euro grant for <b>future</b> <b>research.</b> The committee cited {{his work on}} the Verlinde formula, the Witten–Dijkgraaf–Verlinde–Verlinde equations, the Cardy-Verlinde formula and entropic gravity as the major achievements leading to the award.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{increase}} of future-oriented studies in the recent years, the <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> community is searching for common ground to move the field toward scientific status. The aim of {{this article has been}} to offer a pragmatic, user-oriented perpective to the recently proposed quality criteria for <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> by Kuusi et al. [4] by providing a practical use case where the validity of a new <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> methodology is analyzed by applying these criteria.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the natural}} {{subjects}} for <b>future</b> <b>research</b> is {{the search for the}} exact location of the chiral critical point.

25|$|The Research Excellence Framework was the {{successor}} to the Research Assessment Exercise in 2014.

25|$|Due to a {{fire that}} broke out on January 26, 1949, severe damage was caused to the building, mainly its first floor, and the murals.

30|$|More valid Futures Maps {{define a}} {{distinct}} transdisciplinary field of <b>futures</b> <b>research.</b> In this way, <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> is proceeding towards the target suggested by Bell. According to Bell [3], futures studies {{should not only}} ‘futurise’ existing fields of research but should incorporate more principles of scientific <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> into the perspectives, theories, teaching, and research of ‘old sciences’. Bell ([3] p. 59) considered that without this type of distinct transdisciplinary field, the ‘futurizing’ of other fields of science will be difficult or even impossible.|$|R
30|$|This new {{scientific}} journal aims at enriching the publication landscape for <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> {{by adding a}} “European” dimension to it: focussing on European manifestations of <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> topics related to Europe’s present and future as well as discussions about the perspectives of European thinking and the integration of Europe.|$|R
30|$|Hence, {{this article}} has {{to make do with}} {{outlining}} the criteria for participatory practice research in general and participatory <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> in particular.
