5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E

25|$|The mid-thirteenth century Old French Continuation of William of Tyre (formerly {{attributed}} to Ernoul) claims that Agnes advised {{her son to}} marry Sibylla to Guy, and that Amalric had brought Guy to Jerusalem specifically for him to marry Sibylla. However, this is improbable: given {{the speed with which}} the marriage was arranged, Guy must have already been in the kingdom when the decision was made. With the new King of France, Philip II, a minor, the chief hope of external aid was Baldwin's first cousin Henry II, who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage on account of the Thomas Becket affair. <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vassal of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and as a formerly rebellious vassal, it was in their interests to keep him overseas.|$|E

25|$|Guy {{directed}} {{the world premiere}} of the musical I Dream in July 2010 on the Alliance Stage of the Woodruff Arts Centre in Atlanta. Also in 2010, <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the cast of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and the Alliance Theatre Company co-production of Pearl Cleage’s The Nacirema Society Requests the Honor of Your Presence at a Celebration of Their First One-Hundred Years. The production ran Sept. 24 through Oct. 3 at the Festival in Montgomery, Alabama, before moving to Atlanta’s Alliance Theatre for performances Oct. 20 thru Nov. 14. In early 2011, Guy directed George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum for True Colors, and in June 2011, Ms. Guy costarred with Kenny Leon in their production of Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love at The Balzer Theater at Herren’s in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2010, Guy had joined the True Colors Theatre Company in an off stage role as the company's Producing Director. In announcing the hire, True Colors said Guy's full-time position would be both administrative and artistic, and both local and national. Guy continues to contribute to the company on stage as well.|$|E
25|$|As <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vassal of Richard I, King of England for his {{lands in}} Poitou, Richard {{supported}} {{him in this}} political struggle, while Conrad was supported by his cousin Leopold V of Austria and cousin once-removed Philip II, King of France. Conrad acted as chief negotiator in the surrender of Acre, and raised the kings' banners in the city. Afterwards, the parties attempted {{to come to an}} agreement. Guy was confirmed as king of Jerusalem, and Conrad was made his heir. Conrad would retain the cities of Tyre, Beirut, and Sidon, and his heirs would inherit Jerusalem on Guy's death. In July 1191 Conrad's kinsman, King Philip, decided to return to France, but before he left he turned over half the treasure plundered from Acre to Conrad, along with all his prominent Muslim hostages. King Richard asked Conrad to hand over the hostages, but Conrad refused as long as he could. After he finally relented (since Richard was now leader of the Crusade), Richard had all the hostages killed. Conrad did not join Richard on campaign to the south, preferring to remain with his wife Isabella in Tyre — believing his life to be in danger. It was probably around this time that Conrad's father died.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

500|$|The rest of {{the family}} tries to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E

[...] Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens, calling it [...] "not intentional in the sense I sat down and looked at all my favorite comics and studied them for this film, but, yeah, Kirby's work was definitely in my subconscious programming. The <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> visionary. Absolutely. And he could draw machines like nobody's business. He was sort of like A.

2500|$|The [...] "Cecil effect" [...] is a {{term used}} by some to express the belief that after the killing of Cecil, there was a {{reduction}} in the number of hunters coming to Zimbabwe and a subsequent increase in lion populations in certain areas. Byron du Preez, project leader at the Bubye Valley Conservancy, believes the effect does not exist, saying, [...] "Hunters are not coming because there is a massive recession [...]" [...] Those who believe in the effect say hunters are staying away from Zimbabwe due to fear of negative publicity. About a month after Cecil was killed, when international uproar was at its peak, Zimbabwean hunting guide Quinn Swales was killed by a lion on a hunt. Some of his fellow guides speculated that he was afraid of shooting the animal out of fear of the possible backlash due to Cecil. According to guide Steve Taylor, [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really successful guide, and he died by a lion. And I think that’s the Cecil Effect. Guides in Zimbabwe are petrified of having the world turn on them." ...|$|E
