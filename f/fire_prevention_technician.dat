This was expanded to <b>Fire</b> <b>Prevention</b> Week in 1922.

40|$|Fire is an {{important}} land management tool for smallholders in the Brazilian Amazon. However, when fires are not properly controlled they can give rise to large-scale wildfires that threaten forests, agricultural plantations, and settlement areas. We use data from a survey of 220 households to examine <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> and the scale of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> and burning activities among traditional subsistence households in the Tapajós National Forest in Pará, Brazil. We find that in traditional households, economic variables such as the opportunity cost of household time, market conditions, and the hiring wage are important predictors of these decisions, as is household reliance on standing forest resources for non-timber products. Our results confirm that traditional households actively engage in <b>fire</b> <b>prevention,</b> and suggest that <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> is motivated {{by a desire to}} protect agricultural plantations as well as standing forest reserves. The results suggest that increased income, improved infrastructure, and improved access to markets for labor and agricultural goods will encourage <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> among smallholders in communities with education and planning programs. <b>Fire</b> <b>prevention</b> Household model Floresta Nacional do Tapajos Brazilian Amazon...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} project {{was to examine the}} transformation of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> processes via improved targeting of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions over a four year period. Design / methodology / approach: A four year case study of the transformation of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> processes involving a UK fire and rescue service, local council, NHS primary care trust and a police force was undertaken. Findings: Understanding the socio-economic causal factors underlying unintentional dwelling fires, and the need to work in collaborative partnerships to achieve change in such factors can support more targeted and effective <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> activities. Research limitations / implications: Analysis of underlying causal factors and their relationships, together with population segmentation and working in co-ordinated collaborative partnerships can support enhanced fire risk assessment and community safety. This supported more pro-active early intervention fire risk management. Practical implications: Analysis of socio-economic causal factors, and socio-economic groups associated with unintentional dwelling fires can assist in targeting <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> activities in a more effective and efficient manner. This enabled the fire and rescue service to target <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> to social groups most at risk of dwelling fires and the types of fires (for example, kitchen fires) relevant to the different social groups. Social implications: Collaborative public sector partnerships can achieve change in the socio-economic circumstances of at-risk individuals to support <b>fire</b> <b>prevention.</b> This enables the social and health related factors underlying fire risk to be addressed by the relevant partner health or social services agencies. Originality / value: The detailed analysis of the transformation of <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> activities that led to an implemented approach to enhanced community safety. In particular, the analysis and evaluation of the move to collaborative multi-agency partnerships to support and improve <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> activities...|$|R

The forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> {{background}} database is {{the data}} set which contains all the related data of forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention,</b> mainly including each kind of attribute data, the spatial data {{as well as the}} remote sensing image data. It is a very important basis for the forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> direction. By researching the three-dimensional background database building method, the paper introduces the forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> three-dimensional background database creation method which uses MapX and OpenGL as the development tools, mainly study the following fields in the MapX and OpenGL environment: three dimensional terrain modeling method in forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> background database creation, texture mapping method, two-dimensional and three dimensional linkage, the fusion of the forest resources and <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> resources data, the design of the forest <b>fire</b> <b>prevention</b> three dimensional background database and so on. The real three dimensional terrains are established {{on the basis of the}} OpenGL, the DEM altitude data, the establishment of the illumination, the normal vector and so on. And the demonstration can be implemented really by integrating the OpenGL texture mapping mechanism and the remote sensing data in the three dimensional terrain.
