50|$|In an {{oxidising}} environment metal (and some non-metal) ions {{will lose}} electrons. In iron oxides, Fe2+ (ferrous) ions will become Fe3+ (ferric) ions.

In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn2+) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn3+ or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.|$|E

40|$|In {{transparent}} <b>glass,</b> <b>colour</b> occurs {{through the}} absorption of certain wavelengths of light, and transmission of other wavelengths. In thicker sections of glass, more light is absorbed than in thinner sections, making the thicker sections appear darker, and sometimes a different hue. This phenomenon is called volume colour by Joseph Albers, and together with the optical properties of glass as a denser material than air, leads to remarkable possibilities for glass artists, to work with form to achieve light accents and/or different hues in solid object made from a single transparent <b>glass</b> <b>colour.</b> Artists in the Czech republic have explored this potential in cast glass since the 1960 s, working directly with colour factories, and passing on gained knowledge through teaching. Elsewhere, {{it is difficult for}} artists to explore these possibilities for two reasons: Firstly, the lack of literature on volume colour, and the difficulty of translating theoretical information on optics into practical application. Secondly, on the practical side, it is unusual for artists to work with factories to develop their glass colours. Instead, colours are available in a limited range of hues, and casting colours are developed for small to medium sized objects around 5 cm thickness, therefore often appear very dark or black when used for larger solid casts of more than 10 cm thickness. To explore the relationship between colour, form and light in glass sculpture, artists need to be in control of colour hue and value. To achieve control, they have to either work with a factory, or colour their own glass. This research contributes to the practice of kiln casting through the development of methods to produce homogenous transparent colours in a studio environment, using ceramic crucibles in a kiln. Visual and written guidelines about basic colour results using single colouring agents provide a starting point for development of bespoke hues and densities. Drawing on physics texts and through a thorough study of existing glass sculpture, the optical properties of glass are explained in relation to practical application...|$|E

40|$|Recent archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} in the Iberian-Roman city of La Alcudia (Ilici, Hispania) have provided some important assemblages of Roman glass. The present paper summarizes the results of archaeological and archaeometric studies carried out on two assemblages from different sectors and chronology. The first set of glasses was unearthed in a sector corresponding to a section of the cityâs west wall. The level in which the glasses were found is dated from the mid 1 st to the mid 2 nd century AD. The second set of glasses comes from an area known as Casitas IbÃ©ricas (4 th - 7 th centuries AD). These glasses were found in ditches and pits, which had disturbed the more ancient archaeological levels. Most of the fragments in both sets represent blown glass. The archaeometric study concentrated on deter-mining the chemical composition of a representative selection of glass fragments from the two chronological periods in order to observe possible differences between them. Chromophores responsible for <b>glass</b> <b>colour</b> were identified. Moreover, the state of conservation of the glasses was evaluated {{in order to determine the}} nature of degradation processes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a preliminary study on assessing the photocatalytic activities when nano-TiO 2 is intermixed in self-compacting glass mortars (SCGM) in terms of the air pollutant removal and bacteria inactivation. Nitrogen oxide (NO) and Escherichia coli K 12 were used as the target air pollutant and bacteria test strain respectively. In addition, the influence of nano-TiO 2 dosage (0 %, 2 % and 5 %) and recycled <b>glass</b> <b>colour</b> (light green and transparent) on the fluidity and compressive strength of nano-TiO 2 -based SCGM was also evaluated. The results showed that more superplasticizer dosage was required to help the dispersion of nano-TiO 2 particles to achieve the same fluidity. Meanwhile, with the addition of nano-TiO 2 either 2 % or 5 %, about a 12 % compressive strength increment was observed in SCGM. In the case of NO removal, an increasing trend of NO removal was accompanied by an increase in TiO 2 content. For a given dosage of TiO 2, the SCGM prepared with transparent recycled glass showed a slightly higher NO removal rate than that prepared with light green recycled glass. As for the antibacterial activity, however, all of the TiO 2 intermixed SCGMs showed little inactivation ability of E. coli. Taking into account the above obtained results, it can be concluded that compared with NO removal, photocatalytic bacteria inactivation is a more complex process and the results for photocatalytic activity of NO removal cannot always be extrapolated to photocatalytic antibacterial activity.

40|$|The {{color as}} {{structuring}} material Shapes are stable, whereas colours are elusive 1. It {{is well known}} that, particularly in architecture, the visual acquisition of the colour scales is directly influenced by both the conservation conditions of the elements, which are subjected to the continuous action of chemical and atmospheric aggressions, and the optical effects caused by the reciprocal influence between colour and colour, the famous ???interaction of color??? by Josef Albers: ???no colour exists by itself {{and the nature of}} every hue changes in reaction to the adjacent colours 2. It would be necessary to add other considerations about the themes of the perception event, the transparency, the appearance, the expression, the simultaneous contrast of colours, their composition and the syntactic structure tied to the opposing duality between harmony and disharmony, in order to reveal the so-called visual cohesion forces. These forces are {{the true nature of the}} world and reality; it is not the nature of a fruitless sequence of objects which are placed side by side, but it is the nature of a continuous stratification of elements, because ???every object pushes beyond the merely visible and ventures into the ampler kingdom of the really seeable, which is the face of reality that is oriented towards us 3. With regards to the questions that are more directly referable to the use of colour in architecture, the colour has to be certainly considered as an intrinsic element of the final expression and form, through the factual propriety that makes the spatial effect perceptible. ???The building will gain its right meaning through its transformation in an out-and-out architecture, that is a monumental synthesis of space, shape and colour 4. Through the study of the structural relations expressed by the colour syntax, the colour score becomes the spatial device that produces the exaltation of the contrasts between the architectural components that are organised in the compositive system; moreover, it gives visibility to the plasticity of the space according to a combinatory sequence. Through intervals and contrasts, this sequence aims for an harmonic condition of balance, where every colour conserves its own energy force 5. In the space-time dimension of its plasticity, where the constructive and functional factor transforms itself in a multiple aesthetic factor, architecture acquires the colour in its significant role as expressive element and structuring material like other materials as iron, stone, <b>glass.</b> <b>colour</b> is not only useful for orienting but also, and even more, for satisfying the need to display the reciprocal spatial relationships in terms of proportions, relations, directions. The accord of these relationships is the aesthetic aim of architecture [???]??? which ???[???], finally dissatisfied to show its hidden structure, will develop as an indivisible, inspired totality??? 6. So, there is the densification of a concept: the concept that architecture without colour (that is, the architecture without the colour scale that goes from the neutral greys intervals, which are optically inarticulate, to the evident contrasts that give combinatory fullness) proves to be inexpressive and, in the sense of necessary complementarity between light and colour, it can only be considered a blind architecture 7. Another significant aspect is the aspect that excludes every difference between the colour application and the essence of colour in itself of the matter: just like all the materials, the colour scores dispense energy and, in the interference of their contrasts, produce a tensional regime which, in turn, determines the architectural and aesthetic function 8. Starting just from this last assumption, the contribution that we want to produce is tied to the possibility of determining an evaluation of the colour interactions afferent to the architectural characterisations of a monumental building, in relation to an experience conducted about the comparative readings of the original project drawings and the re-elaborations recently made through infographic processes, according to a system of data gained in situ. The proposed problem concerns the complexity of the process that is activated if we take a sample of colour measurements, according to different measurement systems (from EugÃ¨ne Chevreul???s operative systems, to Albert Munsell???s systematic catalogues, until Harald KÃ¼ppers???s rhombohedron 9), and if we establish actions of comparison and reproducibility through digital techniques. In our century the prevalent interest about the colour system has distinguished and applied itself around colorimetry or simultaneously to the experimentation of the colour visual perception [???] This is actually the summary of the colour modern history: applied colorimetric and psichological techniques (survey and production) ??? 10. The reference architecture is the Prince of Naples Gallery, a building strongly representative of a significant urban transformation of the so-called Fosse del Grano a Napoli area, from the National Museum to Dante square. This transformation, begun since the last decade of the Bourbon reign, materialized in the second half of the Eighteenth Century, starting from the Unity of Italy. Different hypotheses of intervention were formulated; among them, the hypothesis proposed by the architects Saponaro, Catalani, Capaldo and Alvino certainly deserves a mention, as well as the definitive solution which saw the engineer Giovanni de Novellis and the architect Nicola Breglia in action. These ones, following the demolition of the Monastery of S. Giovanniello, elaborated a parcelling plan that included the opening of Pessina street, in place of Fosse del Grano uphill street, of Bellini street, Broggia street and Conte di Ruvo street, the creation of the Academy of Fine Arts, the Bellini theatre and the new Prince of Naples Gallery, for which in 1868 they presented an hypothesis for the arrangement of the ???Front opposite the Museum??? 11. This project was accompanied by other two solutions that led to the final version, which included an iron and glass roof, the first-ever created in Naples, for completing the final stretch of Bellini street in the direction of the Museum. The drawings that accompanied these different proposals, including the final one, are preserved in the historical municipal Archive of Naples. They are characterized by being made with precise chromatic scores both in the wider compositions and in those, numerous, close-up ones; so, they are a precious documentary equipment for developing the comparative study with the representation of the current situation, which derives from the last restoration work, concluded in 2007.

The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the cylinder blown sheet process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven. Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other <b>glass</b> <b>colours</b> may also be flashed.
