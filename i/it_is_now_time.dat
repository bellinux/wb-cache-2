2500|$|On January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar {{called a}} meeting of {{principal}} parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. [...] "After several years of review, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>time</b> to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That is why I am gathering the principal parties together next week to consider {{the findings of the}} Keeper and to discuss how we might find a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources. [...] I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{formed in}} 1969, {{a product of}} campus radicalism, feminism, Canadian {{nationalism}} and left-wing nationalism in general. [...] Its leaders were university professors Mel Watkins, James Laxer and Robert Laxer. It issued a Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada and with support in the NDP caucus and membership worked to try to push the party leftward. The Waffle supported the nationalization of Canadian industries {{to take them out}} of the hands of American interests. [...] The group was endorsed by the New Democratic Youth. The Waffle manifesto stated that [...] "A socialist society must be one in which there is democratic control of all institutions, which have a major effect on men's lives and where there is equal opportunity for creative non-exploitative self-development. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>time</b> to go beyond the welfare state." [...] and that [...] "The New Democratic Party must provide leadership in the struggle to extend working men's influence into every area of industrial decision-making.... By bringing men together primarily as buyers and sellers of each other, by enshrining profitability and material gain in place of humanity and spiritual growth, capitalism has always been inherently alienating. Today, sheer size combined with modern technology further exaggerates man's sense of [...] insignificance and impotence. A socialist transformation of society will return to man his sense of humanity, to replace his sense of being a commodity. But a socialist democracy implies man's control of his immediate environment as well, and in any strategy for building socialism, community democracy is as vital as the struggle for electoral success." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, [...] "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA {{production}} {{that seems to be}} the fate of most Idol winners. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>time</b> to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music is still out there, you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E
