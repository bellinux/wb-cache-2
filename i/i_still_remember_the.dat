I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E

The movement is all I want; the ride will fill the hateful void of time. I go, in defiance of sound advice offered to me on all sides.

40|$|The 3 -D {{version of}} James Cameron’s last movie, “Avatar”, has been {{considered}} a breakthrough in the cinematographic world and <b>I,</b> personally, <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> strong impact {{of the experience of}} watching this film at the IMAX- 3 D cinema. The 3 -D movies must all be grateful to the advent of stereoscopic photography, which dates back to 1838, when Sir Charles Wheatstone invented the first 3 -D stereoscope. Stereoscopy creates an illusion of depth by using eyeglasses to combine two perspectives (2 -D images) which differ by a minor deviation. Although it has only recently been applied for entertainment and in photogrammetry, its basic principles were already noted by the Greek Mathematician Euclid in 300 BC. As beautiful as it can be, it also reveals the great capacity for illusion in the human brain. </p...|$|R

60|$|When the Sleeper Wakes, whose title I {{have now}} altered to The Sleeper Awakes, was first {{published}} as a book in 1899 after a serial appearance in the Graphic {{and one or two}} American and colonial periodicals. It {{is one of the most}} ambitious and least satisfactory of my books, and I have taken the opportunity afforded by this reprinting to make a number of excisions and alterations. Like most of my earlier work, it was written under considerable pressure; there are marks of haste not only in the writing of the latter part, but in the very construction of the story. Except for certain streaks of a slovenliness which seems to be an almost unavoidable defect in me, there is little to be ashamed of in the writing of the opening portion; but it will be fairly manifest to the critic that instead of being put aside and thought over through a leisurely interlude, the ill-conceived latter part was pushed to its end. I was at that time overworked, and badly in need of a holiday. In addition to various necessary journalistic tasks, I had in hand another book, Love and Mr. Lewisham, which had taken a very much stronger hold upon my affections than this present story. My circumstances demanded that one or other should be finished before I took any rest, and so I wound up the Sleeper sufficiently to make it a marketable work, hoping to be able to revise it before the book printers at any rate got hold of it. But fortune was against me. I came back to England from Italy only to fall dangerously ill, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> impotent rage and strain of my attempt to put some sort of finish to my story of Mr. Lewisham, with my temperature at a hundred and two.
