40|$|Abstract — Wearable sensing systems (WSS’s) are {{emerging}} {{as an important}} class of distributed embedded systems in application domains ranging from medical to military. Such systems can be expensive and power hungry due to their multisensor implementations that require constant use, yet by nature they demand low-cost and low-power implementations. Semantic multimodal compression (SMC) mitigates these metrics in terms of data size by leveraging the natural tendency of signals in many types of embedded sensing systems to be composed of phases. In our driving example of a medical shoe with an <b>insole</b> <b>lined</b> with pressure sensors, {{we find that the}} natural airborne, landing, and take-off segments have sharply different and repetitive properties. SMC models and compresses each segment independently, selecting the best compression scheme for each segment and thus reducing total transmission energy. I...|$|R
40|$|Rottefella AS {{launched}} an <b>insole</b> <b>line</b> specialized for cross-country skiing to the Scandinavian market in November 2013. The research question for this thesis {{was developed in}} cooperation with Rottefella and is stated as “Is there a potential market for cross-country insoles in France?” All methods and theories applied, we conclude that France is a strategic key market to enter. The company should further launch the insoles through their existing distributor, Rossignol. The exploratory and descriptive studies uncovered a positive attitude towards cross-country skiing in France among the population living close to the Alps. The study further exposed two categories of users, driven by mainly utilitarian and hedonic motivation. The consumers {{that proved to be}} most utilitarian driven had a higher willingness to pay, while those driven by hedonic goals were the most sensitive towards the new insoles. Moreover, we found that the two forms for motivation are not mutually exclusive. Most of the respondents are driven by a combination of the two. In general, the population of our study is positive towards the insoles. While product adaptation is not necessary for successful introduction to France, promotional adaption needs to be made in order to suit the French target market. When developing their promotional strategy, Rottefella should implement a combination of experiential and informative communication...|$|R
25|$|The Royal Slippers (ฉลองพระบาท) {{take the}} form of an open-heeled slipper with the front curling upwards into a point. The {{exterior}} is decorated with diamonds and jewels, the <b>insoles</b> are <b>lined</b> with red velvet, and the soles are made of pure sheet gold. Wearing footwear was rare in ancient Southeast Asia and was probably reserved only for royalty. The importance of royal footwear {{can be traced back to}} the epic Ramayana, when a pair of Rama's sandals was chosen by Bharata to govern the kingdom in his stead, after the former was forced into exile.|$|R
