40|$|This paper cross-culturally tests an {{extended}} {{version of the}} planned behavior theory. Using cross-sectional surveys of 801 university students from four different cultures (high vs. low individualism, and English- vs. Spanish-speaking), we <b>expected</b> <b>anticipated</b> feelings of guilt to predict behavioral intention in cultures high on individualism, whereas anticipated feelings of embarrassment would be predictive of intention in cultures low on individualism. Results {{from a series of}} structural equation models showed that anticipated embarrassment had virtually the same effect as guilt across all four cultures. Although technically distinct, anticipated guilt and embarrassment were nearly indistinguishable from an individual perspective so that either concept is able to increase the explanatory power of the planned behavior theory for environmental conservation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{research}} {{on the impact of}} affect on attitudes and behavior emphasizes the effect of past and present affective reactions. In this article we focus on anticipated, postbehavioral, affective reactions. The influence of anticipated affective reactions on a number of behaviors was investigated in the context of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1991). Results showed that anticipated affective reactions predicted behavioral intentions independent from general attitudes (evaluations) toward the behavior. As <b>expected,</b> <b>anticipated</b> affective reactions were more negative than attitudes toward the behavior for behaviors with negatively valued consequences and more positive for behaviors with positively valued consequences. Moreover, for three of the four investigated behaviors, anticipated affective reactions explained a significant proportion of variance in behavioral expectations, over and above the components of the theory of planned behavior. On average, behavioral expectations explained {{more than half of the}} variance in actual behavior, which was measured 4 weeks later. Implications of these findings for our understanding of the attitude concept, and more practical implications for behavioral change programs, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The first {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} if overall gender differences in basic confidence as measured by the Expanded Skills Confidence Inventory (ESCI) and basic interests as measured by the 2005 Strong Interest Inventory (SII) would be present within eight college major families. As <b>expected,</b> <b>anticipated</b> overall gender differences in confidence and interests concerning realistic and conventional activities were visible within the major families as well. The second {{purpose was to}} determine whether basic domains of confidence and interests would differentially discriminate among the eight major families differentially for 171 male and 176 female college students. When confidence and interests were examined separately, the set of confidence predictors and the set of interest predictors significantly differentiated among college majors for both men and women. When confidence and interests were combined together as two sets of predictors, the hit rate was a significant improvement over the hit rate for the confidence set of predictors alone for both women and men. As anticipated, group centroids and structure matrices varied across men and women...|$|E
40|$|While {{previous}} research has generally found that immigration raises unemployment for natives, effects are often more muted than <b>expected.</b> <b>Anticipated</b> out-migration responses have been similarly difficult to discern. However, these findings may be byproducts of the long-run nature of most inquiries, which furthermore do not account for changes in natives' labor force participation. In response, this study evaluates {{the impact of the}} arrival of low-skilled immigrants on low-skilled natives in urban areas over a five year period. Initial static results from the Census Basic Monthly Survey clearly indicate that immigrants have a significant negative impact on natives' labor force participation. Building upon these static panel results, characteristics of immigrants' destination choices are examined along with the ensuing adjustment process through dynamic analyses of local markets. Surges of immigrants significantly reduce the labor force participation of low-skilled natives, emphasizing this often neglected channel for labor market adjustment. Previous work may thus understate the true impact of immigrants on local labor markets by focusing on the longer term and ignoring adjustments through participation.

40|$|Pregnancy {{loss and}} {{involuntary}} childlessness {{have long been}} recognised as having potentially devastating impacts on women who desire to be biological mothers. Despite {{the existence of a}} number of studies in these areas, no research has been undertaken which explores the relationship between postponing pregnancy, pregnancy loss and childlessness. This phenomenological study explores the lived experience of six women who underwent pregnancy loss at an advanced maternal age and remain childless. The findings illustrate the multiple losses that result, not only is there a loss of a hoped for child but also of an <b>expected,</b> <b>anticipated</b> future. The study explores how women experienced these painful processes as deeply isolating, how they impacted on their sense of self and how they struggled to rewrite a new future. The research demonstrates the continuing silence surrounding pregnancy loss and involuntary childlessness and highlights the fundamental importance of acknowledging the immediate pain and the lingering sadness associated with being childless. It contributes {{to an understanding of the}} multiple losses experienced and in doing so, hopes to raise awareness in counsellors of the depth of the existential crisis and the need for the multiple losses to be acknowledged and validated...|$|E

Piaget proposed that children moved {{from a position of}} egocentrism to sociocentrism. For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and clinical methods to create what he called a semiclinical interview. He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered, he would ask them a series of nonstandard questions. Piaget was looking for what he called [...] "spontaneous conviction" [...] so he often asked questions the children neither <b>expected</b> nor <b>anticipated.</b> In his studies, he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses. Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children’s ideas by the ideas of those children who were more advanced.|$|R
