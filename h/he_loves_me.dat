25|$|In 2009, Locklear {{joined the}} cast of The CW's updated version of Melrose Place. Beginning on November 17, 2009, she reprised her role as Amanda Woodward and {{appeared}} in eight episodes. Ten {{years after the end}} of the original Melrose Place, Amanda Woodward is now a partner in a public relations firm, and is both mentor and tormentor to a young underling, Ella, played by Katie Cassidy. However, despite Locklear's appearances (along with various other original series regulars), the new show was not a ratings success and was cancelled after one season. In 2011, Locklear starred in the television movie <b>He</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> on the Lifetime Channel.|$|E
500|$|Pru {{called the}} opening track, [...] "Prophecy of a Flower", the album's focal point, saying that [...] "everything else falls {{a little to}} the left and to the right of that". The R and soul song's lyrics {{incorporate}} words from the <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me...</b> <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> not game. The second track, [...] "183 Miles", combines hip hop and country music, its lyrics revolving around a love story. Sampling the Miracles' 1965 song [...] "The Tracks of My Tears", [...] "Candles" [...] is a [...] "midtempo groove" [...] that features the titular object, candles, as a metaphor for [...] "stress (burned at both ends) and healing (lit for meditation)". The Miracles' single was a direct inspiration for the lyrics and instrumentation on the track. Hogan, however, saw [...] "Candles" [...] as diverging from the song's message.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can he refuse this to me, {{coming to}} him, as the request will, from my grave?" [...] rejoined the lovely enthusiast. [...] "He will {{owe it to}} me; he will owe it to our former affection--for <b>he</b> once <b>loved</b> <b>me,</b> Miles; nay, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> even more than you ever did, or could, dearest--much as I know you love me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did! And I MADE him horrid--I know I did! You've taught <b>me</b> that. And <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> a {{thousand}} times better than ever you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{returned}} Jim, {{his face}} white. [...] "You do not understand. <b>He</b> really <b>loved</b> you--I know it. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me,</b> too. Ah, how well! He has gone because--I can't tell you." ...|$|R
500|$|Three solo {{variations}} {{were added}} to the ballet by Petipa during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century. The first was arranged in 1867 for the grand pas de deux of the second tableau for the ballerina Adèle Grantzow. The music was composed by Cesare Pugni and was based on Adolphe Adam's [...] "he loves me, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> not" [...] leitmotif. This variation has been retained in the ballet ever since.|$|E
500|$|Another leitmotif is {{associated}} with the [...] "he loves me, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> not" [...] flower test in Act I, which is heard again in the mad scene, and in Act II when Giselle offers flowers to Albrecht. The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in Act I when Berthe {{tells the story of the}} Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in Act II when the Wilis make their first entrance. The hunting horn motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{inspired}} by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me.</b> It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. [...] "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the [...] "Express Yourself" [...] single release.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Patience; [...] "that's what I value so much: had <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> now, {{there would}} have been no merit on his part; but a sacrifice, you know--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not quite}} all. On Saturday he told <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me.</b> I didn't {{think of it}} before then; I had only {{thought of him as}} an old friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I {{care about}} dignity, and womanliness, and right, {{and all the}} [...] rest of the canting words! I want him. I want his kisses and his [...] arms about me. He is mine! <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> once! I have only given him [...] up because I thought it a fine thing to play the saint. It is only an [...] acted lie. I would rather be evil, and <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me.</b> Why do I deceive [...] myself? I want him. I care for nothing else {{at the bottom of}} my [...] heart--his love, his kisses!" ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fuse in August 2012, Q-Tip confirmed that {{he was working with}} Carey on material for her fourteenth studio album. In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with me because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me,</b> we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... I think we need to get that ready." [...] She also stated that {{it was the first time}} they had worked together since composing [...] "Honey" [...] for Carey's sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).|$|E
500|$|The English tour raised {{little money}} but {{restored}} Wagner's spirits. On his return he {{began work on}} what {{would prove to be}} his final stage work, Parsifal, a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, had she not been there. On a practical level, when the festival's creditors began to press for payment, Cosima's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and {{open the door to the}} prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima's birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to Parsifal. The concert also included the Siegfried Idyll; Cosima wrote afterwards: [...] "There stands he who has called forth these wonders, and <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me.</b> He loves me!".|$|E
500|$|During {{her show}} at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, Madonna {{dedicated}} her song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] to Pope Benedict XVI. She stated, [...] "I'm gonna dedicate this song to the Pope, because, I know <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me.</b> I am a child of God! And you know what else?...." [...] Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera called the dedication a surprising provocation. During the 2009 leg, at the Bucharest concert in Romania, Madonna began talking about gypsy discrimination in East-European countries. She said that [...] "It has been brought to my attention ... {{that there is a}} lot of discrimination against Romanies and Gypsies in general in Eastern Europe. [...] It made me feel very sad." [...] Immediately boos and [...] resounded from the 60,000 crowd. Madonna added that [...] "e don't believe in discrimination [...] we believe in freedom and equal rights for everyone." [...] Although some applauded this statement, many others continued booing when Madonna mentioned discrimination against gay people. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg issued a statement saying that [...] "Madonna has been touring with a phenomenal troupe of Roma musicians who made her aware of the discrimination toward them in several countries so she felt compelled to make a brief statement, [...] She will not be issuing a further statement." [...] In January 2009, Florin Cioabă, self-proclaimed King of Roma, announced that he wished to present Madonna with a gold plaque to thank the singer for criticising discrimination against the Roma people.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, a young dark man. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me,</b> and I thought I {{loved him}} until--until I learned what <b>love</b> is, Etienne. <b>He</b> will never forgive you. He {{has a heart}} of stone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. He {{has asked}} me. He has {{asked me to}} be his wife. I thought <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me.</b> I hoped <b>he</b> did, at least. Oh dear, I did so hope it! And he does!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose not,' said Marie slowly. 'What liars they are, what brutes;--what wretches! Why {{should he}} tell me lies like that? Why should he break my heart? That other man {{never said that}} <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me.</b> Did <b>he</b> never <b>love</b> me,--once?' ...|$|R
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me.</b> It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|Psych. [...] "He Loves Me, <b>He</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> Not, <b>He</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me,</b> Oops He's Dead" [...] (2007): Shawn and Gus connect {{supposed}} [...] "alien abductions" [...] to a speed-dating {{event at}} a local bar, and attend undercover to solve the kidnappings.|$|E
2500|$|Chapman's eighth parole {{application}} was denied in 2014. At the hearing, Chapman said, [...] "I am sorry for being such an idiot and choosing {{the wrong way}} for glory." [...] "I found my peace in Jesus," [...] he continued. [...] "I know him. <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me.</b> He has forgiven me. He has helped in my life like you wouldn't believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It serves me right," [...] she repeated. [...] "I never {{considered}} him worth having, {{and now you}} don't consider ME. But it serves <b>me</b> right. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> a thousand times better than you ever did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The silver is mine; {{my father}} gave it me. It {{looked as if}} my brother would prosper without his help, and I think <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> best. Perhaps this was because I {{believed}} in the vein." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Impossible! Nothing {{should be}} impossible. All {{the people that}} one hears of that are really true to their loves never find {{anything}} impossible. Does <b>he</b> <b>love</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Carbury? It all depends on that. That's what I want to know.' She paused, but Hetta could not answer the question. 'You must know about your brother. Don't you know whether <b>he</b> does <b>love</b> <b>me?</b> If you know I {{think you ought to}} tell me.' Hetta was still silent. 'Have you nothing to say?' ...|$|R
2500|$|St. John {{made her}} last {{appearance}} in musical comedy as Dolores in Florodora (1900–01), {{taking over the}} role from Evie Greene. [...] She made only one known recording, a single Berliner disc of [...] "He Loves Me; <b>He</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>Me</b> Not," [...] from Florodora, which was reproduced on the Pearl LP set [...] "The Art of the Savoyard: Volume II" [...] (GEMM 282/3). She did, however, continue singing in the St. James's Hall Ballad Concerts and in numerous benefits and charity concerts.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>me</b> and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
