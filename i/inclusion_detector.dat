Ing. Eduard Belas CSc.; Institute of Physics, Charles University in Prague Abstract: The work {{was aimed at}} investigation {{of the effect of}} annealing on structural, electrical and optical properties of CdZnTe epitaxial substrates and CdTe-based and CdZnTe-based X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. The first part of the work is focused on investigation {{of structural}} properties of one type of second phase defects - inclusions - present in the material, which degrade the material quality. Consequent annealing experiments were aimed at reduction of these defects. In case of CdZnTe substrates, an annealing treatment leading to increase of the infrared transmittance was investigated. On the other hand, annealing experiments on the detectors of high-energetic radiation were focused on preservation of the high-resistive state. Moreover, the work contains detailed measurements of transport properties of CdTe taken directly at high temperatures. Key words: CdTe, annealing, <b>inclusions,</b> <b>detectors,</b> defect...|$|R
40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} {{a method for}} quantum-state tomography of qudits encoded in the quantum polarization of $N$-photon states. This is achieved by distributing $N$ photons nondeterministically into three paths and their subsequent projection, which for $N= 1 $ is equivalent to measuring the Stokes (or Pauli) operators. The statistics of the recorded $N$-fold coincidences determines the unknown $N$-photon polarization state uniquely. The proposed, fixed setup manifestly rules out any systematic measurement errors due to moving components and allows for simple switching between tomography of different states, which makes it ideal for adaptive tomography schemes.

Monte-Carlo modelling of the efficiency is extended to cascade summing effects from complete decay sequences including positron emitting radionuclides.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{question}} of isospin analysis applied to the pr decay modes of the B {{as a tool to}} extract the CKM angle between v,*,I&d and I$:&, without ambiguities or uncertainties due to penguin amplitude contributions. We find that a maximum-likelihood fit of the parameters to the full Dalitz plot distribution can successfully extract the parameters-perhaps with as few as 1000 events. This result is from a study of Monte-Carlo-generated events without <b>inclusion</b> of <b>detector</b> efficiency or background effects. The interference between channels is a large effect and provides additional constraints on the parameters compared to channelby-channel studies. These can usually lift the degeneracy between the multiple solutions that plague such studies. Inclusion of charged B decays in the analysis would provide an direct check of the Standard Model prediction that the penguin amplitude weak phase for this channel is cancelled by the weak mixing phase...|$|R
40|$|Computed Tomography (CT) {{screening}} and pediatric imaging, among other applications, demand {{the development of}} more efficient reconstruction techniques to diminish radiation dose to the patient. While many methods are proposed to limit or modulate patient exposure to x-ray at scan time, the resulting data is excessively noisy, and generates image artifacts unless properly corrected. Statistical iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques have recently been introduced for reconstruction of low-dose CT data, and rely on the accurate modeling of the distribution of noise in the acquired data. After conversion from detector counts to attenuation measurements, however, noisy data usually deviate from simple Gaussian or Poisson representation, which limits the ability of IR to generate artifact-free images. This paper introduces a recursive filter for IR, which conserves the statistical properties of the measured data while pre-processing attenuation measurements. A basic framework for <b>inclusion</b> of <b>detector</b> electronic noise into the statistical model for IR is also presented. The results are shown to successfully eliminate streaking artifacts in photon-starved situations...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{discovery}} {{potential in the}} Z' sector of a U(1) _B-L enlarged Standard Model (that also includes three heavy Majorana neutrinos and an additional Higgs boson) for √(s) = 7, 10 and 14 TeV centre-of-mass (CM) energies, considering both the Z'_B-L→ e^+e^- and Z'_B-L→μ^+μ^- decay channels. The comparison of the (irreducible) backgrounds with the expected backgrounds for the DØ experiment at the Tevatron validates our simulation. We propose an alternative analysis {{that has the potential}} to improve the DØ sensitivity. Electrons provide a higher sensitivity to smaller couplings at small Z'_B-L boson masses than do muons. The resolutions achievable may allow the Z'_B-L boson width to be measured at smaller masses in the case of electrons in the final state. The run of the LHC at √(s) = 7 TeV, assuming at most ∫L∼ 1 fb^- 1, will be able to give similar results to those that will be available soon at the Tevatron in the lower mass region, and to extend them for a heavier M_Z'.

40|$|Abstract. Growth, {{fabrication}} and {{characterization of}} indium-doped cadmium manganese telluride (CdMnTe) radiation detectors have been described. Alpha-particle spectroscopy measurements and time resolved current transient measurements have yielded an average charge collection efficiency approaching 100 %. Spatially re-solved charge collection efficiency maps {{have been produced}} {{for a range of}} detector bias voltages. Inhomo-geneities in the charge transport of the CdMnTe crystals have been associated with chains of tellurium <b>inclusions</b> within the <b>detector</b> bulk. Further, {{it has been shown that}} the role of tellurium inclusions in degrading charge col-lection is reduced with increasing values of bias voltage. The electron drift velocity was calculated from the rise time distribution of the preamplifier output pulses at each measured bias. From the dependence of drift velocity on applied electric field the electron mobility was found to be µn = (718 ± 55) cm 2 /Vs at room temperature. ...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescence lidar {{measurements}} of the hydroxyl radical require detailed information concerning collision induced processes in order to deduce the radical number density from a lidar return. The Goddard SFC OH lidar currently utilizes a broadband detector which precludes the necessity of fully understanding collisional redistribution of rotational energy within the excited state. Numerous advantages result however from the <b>inclusion</b> of a <b>detector</b> with a bandpass only slightly larger that the Doppler width of a rotational line. This however places more stringent requirements on the spectroscopy. Measurements were accordingly made of rotationally resolved quenching rates for collisions with O 2, N 2, and H 2 O. Rotational transfer rates were also measured for the same colliders. Quenching rates were measured using a Nd-YAG pumped Rh 6 G dye laser doubled into the UV. The OH lifetimes were measured {{as a function of}} pressure of quenching gas at total pressures of between 50 and 250 microns.

40|$|The {{technological}} improvements, design {{choices and}} mission goals {{which led to}} the <b>inclusion</b> of CCD <b>detectors</b> in the wide field camera of the Large Space Telescope (LST) to be launched by the STS are recounted. Consideration of CCD detectors began before CCDs had seen wide astronomical applications. During planning for the ST, in the 1960 s, photographic methods and a vidicon were considered, and seemed feasible provided that periodic manual maintenance could be performed. The invention of CCDs was first reported in 1970 and by 1973 the CCDs were receiving significant attention as potential detectors instead of a vidicon, which retained its own technological challenges. The CCD format gained new emphasis when success was achieved in developments for planetary-imaging spacecraft. The rapidity of progress in CCD capabilities, coupled with the continued shortcomings of the vidicon, resulted in a finalized choice for a CCD device by 1977. The decision was also prompted by continuing commercial and military interest in CCDs, which was spurring the development of the technology and improving the sensitivities and reliability while lowering the costs...|$|R
40|$|A new beam line at {{the fast}} neutron {{spallation}} source at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center has been constructed for studies of neutron-induced reactions producing gamma rays, internal conversion electrons or neutrons. This facility, called FIGARO (Fast neutron-Induced GAmma-Ray Observer), follows on the great successes of GEANIE (described in other contributions to this Conference), by detecting de-excitation gamma rays with high-resolution germanium detectors. FIGARO has fewer gamma-ray detectors than GEANIE, but instead offers other features including: extremely good collimation of the neutron beam for background reduction, a flexible experimental area to optimize detection efficiency and to allow evaluation of other detectors such as ICEBALL-II for internal conversion electrons, <b>inclusion</b> of neutron <b>detectors</b> {{for the study of}} neutron-gamma coincidences, beam time to relieve the scheduling pressure on GEANIE, and a PC-based data acquisition system.

40|$|For the {{development}} and improvement of multi-pinhole SPECT systems, high-resolution gamma cameras can be essential. Electron-multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCDs) have a high resolution and sensitivity and therefore can be extremely useful for application in photon-counting scintillation gamma cameras. The scintillation crystal captures the gamma photons and converts their energy into (visible) light photons, which are detected by the EMCCD. A very low readout noise and a high sensitivity (over 90 % for the visible spectrum) enable these devices to detect individual gamma interactions in the crystal. Algorithms {{have been developed to}} analyze the EMCCD images for the presence of the scintillation events and provide estimates of their position and energy content. The first photon-counting gamma camera based on EMCCDs was demonstrated in our group in 2005. Subsequently, {{during the course of this}} PhD project all elements of this gamma camera have been investigated and improved. This thesis will introduce the essential components of a CCD-based gamma camera, and subsequent chapters demonstrate improvements that have been implemented. These improvements range from the gamma photon-detection algorithm, the readout mode of the CCD, the optical coupling between scintillator and CCD, the scintillator material itself to the <b>inclusion</b> of side <b>detectors</b> for a priori indication of the number of interactions in the scintillation crystal. The thesis concludes with some future investigations and prospects. Radiation, Radionuclides & ReactorsApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Radiance {{spectroscopy}} {{was applied}} to the interstitial detection of localized inclusions containing Au nanocages or nanorods with various concentrations embedded in porcine muscle phantoms. The radiance was quantified using a perturbation approach, which enabled the separation of contributions from the porcine phantom and the localized inclusion, with the inclusion serving as a perturbation probe of photon distributions in the turbid medium. Positioning the inclusion at various places in the phantom allowed for tracking of photons that originated from a light source, passed through the inclusion's location, and reached a <b>detector.</b> The <b>inclusions</b> with high extinction coefficients were able to absorb nearly all photons in the range of 650 - 900 nm, leading to a spectrally flat radiance signal. This signal could be converted to the relative density of photons incident on the inclusion. Finally, the experimentally measured quantities were expressed via the relative perturbation and arranged into the classical Beer-Lambert law that allowed one to extract the extinction coefficients of various types of Au nanoparticles in both the transmission and back reflection geometries. It was shown that the spatial variation of perturbation could be described as 1 /r dependence, where r is the distance between the <b>inclusion</b> and the <b>detector.</b> Due to a larger absorption cross section, Au nanocages produced greater perturbations than Au nanorods of equal particle concentration, indicating a better suitability of Au nanocages as contrast agents for optical measurements in turbid media. Individual measurements from different inclusions were combined into detectability maps...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{potential}} of several Neutrino Factory (NF) setups to constrain, discover and measure new physics effects due to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in propagation through Earth matter. We first study the impact of NSI in the measurement of θ_ 13 : we find that these could be large due to strong correlations of θ_ 13 with NSI parameters in the golden channel, and the <b>inclusion</b> of a <b>detector</b> at the magic baseline is crucial {{in order to reduce}} them as much as possible. We present, then, the sensitivity of the considered NF setups to the NSI parameters, paying special attention to correlations arising between them and the standard oscillation parameters, when all NSI parameters are introduced at once. Off-diagonal NSI parameters could be tested down to the level of 10 ^- 3, whereas the diagonal combinations (ϵ_ee - ϵ_ττ) and (ϵ_μμ-ϵ_ττ) can be tested down to 10 ^- 1 and 10 ^- 2, respectively. The possibilities of observing CP violation in this context are also explored, by presenting a first scan of the CP discovery potential of the NF setups to the phases ϕ_eμ, ϕ_eτ and δ. We study separately the case where CP violation comes only from non-standard sources, and the case where it is entangled with the standard source, δ. In case δ turns out to be CP conserving, the interesting possibility of observing CP violation for reasonably small values of the NSI parameters emerges.

40|$|Multi walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs) possess {{properties that}} make them particularly relevant for sensing applications in both the gas and liquid phase. This study presents an evaluation of cheap readily available CVD grown MWCNTs for use as fire gas sensors. Current fire detectors exploit heat and smoke detectors and {{it is hoped that}} the <b>inclusion</b> of gas <b>detectors</b> will increase the speed and reliability of detection. In order to prepare a variety of different MWCNTs a range of CVD synthesis were employed including an injected catalyst method where MWCNTs grew in dense mats from quartz substrates, MWCNTs were also synthesised using a sputtered Fe catalyst layer with acetylene as the carbon source which enabled control over the positioning of the growth. In each case, the growth parameters were varied until aligned growth was achieved. Doping of MWCNTs was also carried out as this may enhance and enable some control over the electrical properties of the CNTs; nitrogen was also added as a dopant by including 1, 4 -diazine as a precursor, and the effects on morphology of the MWCNTs produced were studied. The chemistry of the surface is also known to affect the sensing properties of CNTs. A batch of MWCNTs produced via the injected catalyst method were purifed by acid reflux, base washing and high temperature vacuum annealing, then modified with platinum or palladium metal nanoparticles via a reduction of the metal salts under hydrogen. MWCNTs were also coated with the polymer polyethyleneimine and with copperphthalocyanine. Prototype sensor devices were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of these modified MWCNTs, and gas testing was carried out with the gases NO 2, NH 3, CO, H 2 and C 3 H 6. The mechanisms of sensing were investigated by repeating the tests at different temperatures, which revealed which sensing mechanisms were dominant and responses were compared between the differently modified MWCNTs. Sensor response was also investigated with a series of vapours to probe the dispersive and polar interactions on the MWCNT walls. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The European Organization for Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva is {{currently}} constructing the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), {{which will allow}} {{the study of the}} subnuclear ranges of physics with an accuracy never achieved before. Within the LHC project, ALICE is to the study of strongly interacting matter at extreme densities and high temperatures. ALICE as many other modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments uses silicon pixel detectors for tracking close to the interaction point (IP). The ALICE Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD) will constitute the two innermost layers of ALICE, and will due to its high granularity provide precise tracking information. In heavy ion collisions, the track density could be as high as 80 tracks/cm 2 in the first SPD layer. The SPD will provide tracking information at radii of 3. 9 and 7. 6 cm from the IP. It is a fundamental element {{for the study of the}} weak decays of the particles carrying heavy flavour, whose typical signature will be a secondary vertex separated from the primary vertex by a few hundred microns only. The SPD will provide a spatial resolution of around 12 Âµm in the rÏ-direction. One of the specific challenges for the ALICE SPD will be the stringent material budget constraints (< 1 % per layer) in order to have as small as possible influence on the traversing particles. In the design and production process, these constraints were followed to the point, so will the sensor and the readout chip have a total thickness of only 350 Âµm and the signal lines from the front-end to the on-detector electronics will be deployed in complete aluminum. The results presented in this thesis illustrate the measurements performed in order to characterize the detector performance and qualify components for <b>inclusion</b> in the <b>detector</b> and depicts the work carried out needed for the production phase of the SPD. Quality assurance criteria and test procedures have been developed and fine-tuned for the different components of the SPD. The tests involved visual inspection, electrical tests as well as measurements using a radioactive source. Two beam tests were carried out in the past years. In October 2003 one pixel plane was studied in a heavy ion beam as well as in a proton/pion beam. Four other pixel planes were used as reference planes for tracking. In November 2004 a joint beam test with two planes of each subdetector of the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS) took place. For the first time the ALICE data acquisition system (DATE) and the ALICE trigger system were used with two planes of each subdetector. A new tracking algorithm for the proton/pion beam data taking the tilt and the azimuthal angle into account was developed. With this new tracking method it was possible also to analyze the data taken at the wide beam setting during the beam tests 2003. Further, a study of the cluster sizes as function of different operating parameters, i. e. threshold, and track incidence angle was performed giving a comparison between two sensor thicknesses (200 Âµm and 300 Âµm). A test system based on a pulsed infrared laser was established in order to test SPD assemblies and the FastOr signal generated by the pixel chip. This laser allowed for the first time a complete characterization of the working point and performance of the chip internally generated FastOr signal. This signal will contribute to the L 0 trigger decision in ALICE proton-proton runs. It will be the first time a large high energy physics experiment uses tracking information from a pixel detector for low level triggering. Furthermore, the setup allowed a detailed study of the ALICE 1 LHCB chip characteristics with well defined timing and energy deposition in the silicon sensor. A laser calibration was performed using the internal threshold DAC and two radioactive sources (55 Fe and 109 Cd) providing a precise absolute calibration of the detector for the first time. The laser measurements on ALICE assemblies could directly be compared with the results of the beam test 2002 and 2003. During my doctoral thesis at CERN, I have developed and applied test criteria for the SPD components. Furthermore, I developed an infra red laser test system which allowed a detailed study of the detector performance, a special cluster size study and the functionality of the FastOr signal. The cluster size studies obtained with the laser measurements are compared with the results from the beam test data taken in high energy particle beams...|$|R
