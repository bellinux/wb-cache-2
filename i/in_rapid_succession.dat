This is exceedingly fine also, and wonderful as a variation upon that awful music; but Cain is the astonishment and the overwhelmingness. If it were not, however, {{for the second}} thunder, {{we should not have}} had the two silences; for I doubt whether they are not better even than one.

5|$|Supplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habré rapidly reorganized {{his forces}} (now called Chadian National Armed Forces, or FANT). FANT marched north {{to confront the}} GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Abéché. Habré crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> Abéché, Biltine, Fada and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, {{threatening}} to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. <b>In</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
5|$|L'Arianna was {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> by three brand new Monteverdi operas, of which Il ritorno was the first. The second, Le nozze d' Enea in Lavinia ("The Marriage of Aeneas to Lavinia"), was performed during the 1640–41 carnival; Monteverdi's music is lost, but {{a copy of}} the libretto, of unknown authorship, survives. The last of the three, written for the 1642–43 carnival, was L'incoronazione di Poppea ("The Coronation of Poppea"), performed shortly before the composer's death in 1643.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage was}} done on the lakes. Major shipwrecks occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated that the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} {{on south}} Samar on December10, Hibok-Hibok erupted six times <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> worsening {{the effects of}} both the typhoon and the volcano. Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the washing away of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E

Around the same time, she was also selected for solo roles within the Helsinki Strings, touring among others in England.|$|R
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, {{one of whom}} only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and swept through Venetia, taking <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced {{difficulties}} only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns {{closer to the}} coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
50|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with reproductive success. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that {{stand in the}} way of successfully producing offspring and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide. To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring. Additionally, mating <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm. This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via honest signals.|$|R
50|$|Animation {{creation}} {{methods include}} the traditional animation creation method and those involving stop motion animation {{of two and}} three-dimensional objects, paper cutouts, puppets and clay figures. Images are displayed <b>in</b> a <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> usually 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second. Computer animation processes generating animated images with the general term computer-generated imagery (CGI). 3D animation uses computer graphics, while 2D animation is used for stylistic, low bandwidth and faster real-time renderings.|$|R
2500|$|For coagulation, {{the average}} power is {{typically}} reduced below {{the threshold of}} cutting. Typically, sine wave is turned on and off <b>in</b> a <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> [...] The overall effect is a slower heating process, which causes tissue to coagulate. In simple coagulation/cutting mode machines, the lower duty cycle typical of coagulation mode is usually heard by the ear as a lower frequency and a rougher tone than the higher frequency tone typical of cutting mode with the same equipment.|$|R
5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1941 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period during 1941 in which tropical cyclones {{formed in the}} Atlantic Basin. It was a relatively inactive {{hurricane season}}, with only six known storms. It officially began on June 16, 1941, and lasted until November 1, 1941. These dates delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic basin. Of the six cyclones, four attained hurricane status, and three became major hurricanes. The active season had an abnormally late start; the first system formed on September 11, nearly {{three months after the}} official beginning date. The season was also short-lived, as all six storms developed <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> On September 23, three hurricanes existed simultaneously in the Atlantic basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; {{most of the people in}} the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E
60|$|Mamie was {{the last}} of a series of nurses who came and went <b>in</b> {{somewhat}} <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> {{during the early years of}} the White Hope's life. She was introduced by Steve, who, it seemed, had known her since she was a child. She was the nineteen-year-old daughter of a compositor on one of the morning papers, a little, mouselike thing, with tiny hands and feet, a soft voice, and eyes that took up far more than their fair share of her face.|$|R

5000|$|His {{compositions}} include Rêverie mélancolique and Sérénade humoristique for orchestra, a concertino {{for three}} pianos (which has been recently {{performed in the}} USA), The Fantasmorgories Suite, Suite for Two Pianos, 6 Concert Studies after Chopin's Études, Concert Étude after Chopin's Minute Waltz, 2 Valse-Caprices on Themes of Schubert, 4 Valse-Caprices on themes of Strauss, and arrangements and transcriptions such as the Scherzo from Felix Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream for two pianos, {{and a large number}} of works by Bach transcribed for one or two pianos. His composition Feux-Follets (from [...] "Pastels For Piano", no. 3) was recorded [...] by his pupil Guiomar Novaes, a Brazilian pianist. He wrote a considerable number of transcriptions for the left hand. Philipp's compositions and transcriptions often require a high degree of finger dexterity and lightness of touch, and he liked to work <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of double thirds, fourths and octaves in many of his pieces.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such as Washington Journal. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E
5|$|There {{were far}} less goals {{scored in the}} replay at Arsenal Stadium. After a snow flurry, the ground was left muddy and the play was mostly limited to long balls. Brain hit the post in the first half, with was then {{followed}} by the only goal of the game came shortly afterwards following a run by Buchan into the Port Vale box. From here on, Arsenal {{did not have to}} leave London at all in the competition. In the following round, they defeated Liverpool by two goals to nil, the same scoreline seen in the league earlier in the season. This was Liverpool's first defeat of the year. Both the goals came as a result of indirect free kicks <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> First a header by Brain, then another by Buchan which the goalkeeper could only clear after it had crossed the line.|$|E
5000|$|... 1974-1975- Spurred by {{a former}} U.P. classmate, N. Carating, Roy Veneracion joined an art contest {{sponsored}} by the newly founded Miladay Art Gallery in Makati. He did not win the contest but his entry so-impressed some art enthusiasts and art professionals that he was offered a One-Man-Show in the Gallery that same year. The show was followed by other shows <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> wherein Roy became known as an enfant terrible Abstract Expressionist. His painting style consisted of pouring liquified oil paint onto puddles of water on prepared board panels laid {{flat on the floor}} which he tilted to make the mixture flow in various directions creating rainbows of colors that coalesce into unpredictable Surreal configurations. The medium and the technique suggested the direction to take with subsequent improvisational gestures that sometimes included: soil, pebbles, nails, twigs, and print markings of the artist's body. Roy Veneracion’s art activities attracted the attention of like-minded artists, art dealers and connoisseurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{drums and}} {{electric}} guitar were recorded live for every song by Krawinkel and Behrens and Remmler's vocals were dubbed over afterwards.
