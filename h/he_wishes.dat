5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad to explain why <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E

60|$|As he {{was passing}} Milton's study, a white figure glided out of it. All {{that he had}} ever read or heard of spectres rushed into Shoeblossom's petrified brain. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> was safely in bed. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had never come out of it. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had led a better and nobler life. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had never been born.|$|R

With an unsympathetic rector. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had it in him to make some resounding appeal. He might of course preach a series of thumping addresses and sermons, rather on the lines of [...] "Fors Clavigera," [...] to masters and men, in the Cathedral. Only it was so difficult to get either masters or men into the Cathedral.|$|R

In conversation, Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming house. This makes the audience aware that the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room to kidnap her. In the truncated theatrical print, how the Palladists found Jacqueline is left unclear.|$|E
5|$|Zemus is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the game. <b>He</b> <b>wishes</b> to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth.

5|$|Despite {{secretly}} suppressing {{her feelings}} for Mark, Lexie and Alex assume a casual relationship, that Lexie {{begins to take}} too seriously and flaunts to make Mark jealous. Lexie is able to use her eiditic memory to help Alex with several of his cases. Meanwhile, Mark and Lexie never seem to get their timing right, with Lexie disinterested and angry at Mark when <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to reconcile, or Mark being caught sleeping with a flavor {{of the day when}} Lexie wants to rekindle their relationship.|$|E

60|$|He mounted his three-legged {{stool and}} away he {{flew through the}} air until he had come again to the tavern where he was lodging. There he sat him down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter he made was worth the having, I can tell you. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> for a grand palace of white marble, and then <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> {{for all sorts of}} things to fill it--the finest that could be had. Then <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> for {{servants}} in clothes of gold and silver, and then <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> for fine horses and gilded coaches. Then <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> for gardens and orchards and lawns and flower-plats and fountains, and all kinds and sorts of things, until the sweat ran down his face from hard thinking and <b>wishing.</b> And as <b>he</b> thought and <b>wished,</b> all the things <b>he</b> thought and <b>wished</b> for grew up like soap-bubbles from nothing at all.|$|R
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections {{once they have}} chosen to enforce the act - the parties cannot alter or end the {{contract}} if the third party has told them that <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to enforce the contract or relied on the contract (and the promisor knows this or {{could be expected to}} have known this). If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have if he had been a party to the initial contract.|$|E

But while they are doing this, Peter accidentally spills the beans to Barbara about the affair, and Barbera is instantly devastated by this and runs of the room sobbing.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E

The story {{takes place in the}} {{imaginary}} land of Meluha and narrates how the inhabitants of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to find a clue to reach the Naga people.

His father lets him, and Frank Jr. and Betty agree to go with him to make sure he arrives safely.|$|E
5|$|The simpler {{roots of}} designs in Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. Designs, in general, {{have become increasingly}} complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> for Pokémon design {{to return to the}} simpler roots of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|Thalaba travels {{down into}} the cave and meets the warrior Othatha chained to rocks. Thalaba frees Othatha before {{travelling}} further until he meets an Efreet that guards a gate to the Domdaniel. After shooting an arrow into an eye of the Efreet, {{he is able to}} proceed forward where he meets Khawla and Mohareb. He is able to knock them away from him and quickly moves forward to find the powerful sword of his father. The sword of flames covers Thalaba in flames which causes the area to be filled with light. This scares the sorcerers who then try to attack him. After Thalaba defeats Mohareb and the sorcerers, the voice of Mohammad asks Thalaba what <b>he</b> <b>wishes.</b> Thalaba simply gives his will up to the Prophet before destroying an evil idol, which destroys the cave.|$|E
