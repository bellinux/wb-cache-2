40|$|Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, such as {{gallium nitride}} (GaN), {{are more and}} more being used in {{switching}} power devices. An AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN Double Heterojunction Field Effect transistor (DHFET) was developed in previous work and needed to be tested. The used test circuit was a buck converter. This type of converter, in addition with the normally-on switching behaviour of the GaN-based transistors, requires dedicated gate drive circuitry, resulting in the development of three types of gate-drivers. This paper presents the topology and performance of these drivers. Because of the type of converter, the drivers need to be galvanically isolated. Furthermore, because the experimental GaN transistors are normally-on, the drivers need to be robust so that they apply a negative gate-to-source voltage to switch off the transistor in case an error occurs in the driver. A third requirement for the drivers is {{that it has to be}} easy to adjust the voltage levels, in order to test the devices at different gate-to-source voltage conditions. A final requirement is that it has to be possible to construct the drivers with readily available electronic components. Because the drivers are galvanically isolated, there is a parasitic <b>isolation</b> <b>capacitance</b> in the DC-DC-converter of the drivers. This gives rise to a common-mode current which possibly can disturb the operation of the driver. The article also discusses this common-mode problem. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The flux {{modulation}} scheme (FMS) {{is the standard}} readout technique of dc SQUIDs, where a step-up transformer links the SQUID to the preamplifier. The transformer's primary winding shunts the SQUID via a large capacitor while the secondary winding connects it to the preamplifier. A modulation flux having a frequency of typically 100 [*]kHz generates an ac voltage across the SQUID, stepped up by the transformer. The SQUID with FMS is customarily operated in the current bias mode, because a constant dc bias current flows only through the SQUID due to the capacitor isolation. With FMS, however, the transformer ac shunts the SQUID so that in reality the operating mode is neither purely current-biased nor voltage-biased but rather nominal current-biased or “mixed biased. ” Our objective is to experimentally investigate the consequences of ac shunting of the dc SQUID in FMS and the transformer's transfer characteristics. For different shunt values we measure {{the change in the}} SQUID bias current due to the ac shunt using another SQUID in the two-stage readout scheme, and simultaneously monitor the SQUID output voltage signal. We then explain our measurements by a simplified graphic analysis of SQUID intrinsic current-voltage (I–V) characteristics. Since the total current flowing through the SQUID is not constant due to the shunting effect of the transformer, the amplitude of SQUID flux-to-voltage characteristics V(Φ) is less as compared to the direct readout scheme (DRS). Furthermore, we analyze and compare V(Φ) obtained by DRS and FMS. We show that in FMS, the transfer characteristics of the SQUID circuit also depend on the <b>isolation</b> <b>capacitance</b> and the dynamic resistance of the SQUID...|$|E
40|$|For the {{endorsement}} of the study of potential utilization of the emerging silicon carbide (SiC) devices, three SiC active switches, namely SJEP 120 R 063 (1200 V, 63 mohm) SiC JFET manufactured by Semisouth, BT 1206 AC-P 1 (1200 V, 125 mohm) SiC BJT by TranSiC and CMF 20120 (1200 V, 80 mohm, 33 A) SiC MOSFET by Cree have been investigated systematically in this thesis work. The four layer PCB board with the smart layouts like the drain and gate traces are either perpendicular to each other or run into different directions with virtually no overlap or paralleling to each other. The slits between the gate, drain and source and the selection of DC-DC isolated power supply with low <b>isolation</b> <b>capacitance</b> are considered. These all techniques are considered not to have ground bounce and coupling capacitances through the PCB or device. Likewise the use of probe-tip adapter for making test points, using surface mounted components as far as possible, small trace length in high current power loop are some of the techniques implemented to optimize the layout. The correct measurement are recorded using the right probe and oscilloscope which are capable of tracking the fast rising and falling waveforms (about 10 ns rise and fall-time). The test with various combinations of freewheeling diodes, gate voltages, gate- resistors, gate-source capacitances, gate-source resistors, and snubber are carried out. These combination of tests help to realize the cause of voltage and current overshoots, observe the effect of those combinations on voltage and current rise-time and switching energy losses. Moreover, the measurement issues are exemplified. For accurate measurements, {{it is very important to}} de-skew the voltage and current probes to insure that all of the delays are the same. De-skewing the voltage probes and current probes is easily done adjusting the channels de-skew on the oscilloscope so that both pulses are time synchronized. It is noticed that faster the device, higher the efficiency, higher the power density, but more the ringings and device stresses. Switching energy losses have minor dependencies on temperature thereby more stable operation in PV inverters...|$|E
40|$|MOS/silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) {{technology}} {{is shown to}} permit the realization of large-scale integrated arrays that combine the best features of monolithic bipolar and MOS technologies. The perfect <b>isolation</b> and reduced <b>capacitance</b> of SOS technology make possible static MOS circuits with nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in speed and dynamic power dissipation over their monolithic counterparts. CMOS/SOS memory arrays have been fabricated with speeds comparable to TTL bipolar memory arrays even when operated at TTL compatible levels.

50|$|The {{frequency}} of the common mode voltage can adversely affect performance. Higher frequency common mode voltages create difficulty for many isolation amplifiers due to the parasitic <b>capacitance</b> of the <b>isolation</b> barrier. This <b>capacitance</b> appears as a low impedance to higher frequency signals, and allows the common mode voltage to essentially blow past the barrier and interfere with measurements, or even damage the amplifier. However, most common mode voltages are a composite of line voltages, so frequencies generally remain in the 50 to 60 Hz region with some harmonic content, well within the rejection range of most isolation amplifiers.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{very high}} fluences (e. g. up to 2 × 1016 1 MeV neq/cm 2) and total {{ionising}} doses (TID) {{of the order}} of 1 Grad, expected at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), impose new challenges for the design of effective, radiation resistant detectors. Ionising energy loss is the dominant effect for what concerns SiO 2 and SiO 2 /Si interface radiation damage. In particular, surface damage can create a positive charge layer near the SiO 2 /Si interface and interface traps along the SiO 2 /Si interface, which strongly influence the breakdown voltage, the inter-electrode <b>isolation</b> and <b>capacitance,</b> and might also impact the charge collection properties of silicon sensors. To better understand in a comprehensive framework the complex and articulated phenomena related to surface damage at these very high doses, measurements on test structures have been carried out in this work (e. g. C–V and I–V). In particular, we have studied the properties of the SiO 2 layer and of the SiO 2 /Si interface, using MOS capacitors, gated diodes (GD) and MOSFETs manufactured by FBK on high-resistivity n-type and p-type silicon, before and after irradiation with X-rays in the range from 50 krad(SiO 2) to 20 Mrad(SiO 2). Relevant parameters have been determined for all the tested devices, converging in the oxide charge density NOX, the surface generation velocity s 0 and the integrated interface-trap density NIT dose-dependent values. These parameters have been extracted to both characterize the technology {{as a function of the}} dose and to be used in TCAD simulations for the surface damage effect modeling and the analysis and optimization of different classes of detectors for the next HEP experiments...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of RF MEMS switches with novel materials and micromachining techniques for the RF and microwave applications. To enable the integration of RF and microwave components on CMOS grade silicon, finite ground coplanar waveguide transmission line on CMOS grade silicon wafer were first studied using micromachining techniques. In addition, several RF MEMS capacitive switches were developed with novel materials. A novel approach for fabricating low cost capacitive RF MEMS switches using directly photo-definable high dielectric constant metal oxides was developed, these switches exhibited significantly higher <b>isolation</b> and load <b>capacitances</b> as compared to comparable switches fabricated using a simple silicon nitride dielectric. The second RF MEMS switch developed is on a low cost, flexible liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. Its very low water absorption (0. 04 %), low dielectric loss and multi-layer circuit capability make it very appealing for RF Systems-On-a-Package (SOP). Also, a tunable RF MEMS switch on a sapphire substrate with BST as dielectric material was developed, the BST has a very high dielectric constant (> 300) making it very appealing for RF MEMS capacitive switches. The tunable dielectric constant of BST provides a possibility of making linearly tunable MEMS capacitor-switches. For the first time a capacitive tunable RF MEMS switch with a BST dielectric and its characterization and properties up to 40 GHz was presented. Dielectric charging is the main reliability issue for MEMS switch, temperature study of dielectric polarization effect of RF MEMS was investigated in this dissertation. Finally, integration of two reconfigurable RF circuits with RF MEMS switches were discussed, the first one is a reconfigurable dual frequency (14 GHz and 35 GHz) antenna with double polarization using RF MEMS switches on a multi-layer LCP substrate; and the second one is a center frequency and bandwidth tunable filter with BST capacitors and RF MEMS switches on sapphire substrate.

40|$|In many power {{electronic}} applications galvanic isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers are advantageously used. The main reasons are safety issues, driving high voltage power semiconductors with blocking voltages of typically 600 V or above and avoiding or minimizing unwanted ground current loops. The last can disturb the driver or the whole {{power electronic}} system. In this paper a new method for achieving galvanic isolation in high voltage drivers based on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) integrated capacitive coupling elements will be described. The suggested coupling element consists {{of a pair of}} plate capacitors by using copper layers and prepregs of a PCB. First, the influence of the <b>isolation</b> barrier coupling <b>capacitance,</b> {{which is one of the}} main important parameters of a galvanic isolated d river, is illustrated by a simple model of the capacitive current loop. As a result it is stated that the coupling capacitance should be lower than 5 pF to achieve high dU/dt levels of at least 100 kV/μs with the modeled driver circuit. Hereby and taking into account the isolation characteristics of the commonly used FR 4 PCB material, an integrated capacitive coupling element is designed. With 360 μm isolation distance, and a plate surface of approximately 8 mm², a capacitance of about 1 pF is achieved. A comparison of the developed capacitive coupling element with a comparable inductive coupling element (transformer) shows that the former has advantages due to a much lower current consumption and less dependency on parasitic inductancies. Therefore using galvanic isolat ed drivers in system integrated power electronics means achieving very small solutions. On the other side high isolation voltages on PCBs require wide creepage and clearance distances, especially at higher humidity levels. For solving this conflict a special layout is suggested, were the both sides behind the isolation barrier of the driver are placed on different sides on the PCB by using blind and buried vias. In addition a method for transmitting the switching signal over the isolation barrier is suggested. The well known Manchester coding is applied to use the advantages of phase modulated signals. Reducing the complexity for decoding the switching signal, it is suggested to transmit the carrier frequency by a second capacitive coupling element. Hereby, coder as well as decode r could be realized by a simple exclusive logic or gate. To verify the new isolation method a half bridge driver was built up. With that a bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter, operating at a DC link voltage of 300 V, was successfully controlled. Moreover measurements with a standardized burst generator show, that failure free operation of the driver are possible up to high dU/dt levels...|$|R
