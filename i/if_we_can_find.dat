25|$|This {{gives us}} an abelian hidden {{subgroup}} problem, as f corresponds to a group homomorphism. The kernel corresponds to modular multiples of (r,1). So, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> the kernel, we can findr.|$|E
25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E

25|$|This form {{suggests}} that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a function ψ whose gradient {{is given by}} P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary {{can be related to}} the study of the level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E

Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> him." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} this study is that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> an affine transformation [...] such that [...] is a constant times the unit matrix, then we obtain a fixed-point that is invariant to affine transformations (Lindeberg 1994 section 15.4; Lindeberg and Garding 1997). For the purpose of practical implementation, this property can often be reached by in either of two main ways. The first approach is based on transformations of the smoothing filters and consists of: ...|$|E

"Then, let us {{search for}} my canoe, {{and get out}} of the rice. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> but <b>find</b> my canoe, we shall be safe enough, for the savages have nothing in which to cross the river.

2500|$|Coward {{received}} {{no fewer than}} 30 telegrams from Lawrence about the play. She first {{said that she had}} read the play and there was [...] "nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed." [...] Coward [...] "wired back curtly that the only thing {{that was going to be}} fixed was her performance." [...] Lawrence was indecisive about what to do about her previous commitment to André Charlot. Coward finally responded that he planned to cast the play with another actress. By the time he returned to London, he found Lawrence not only had cleared her schedule but was staying at Edward Molyneux's villa in Cap-d'Ail in southeastern France learning her lines. Coward joined her, and the two began rehearsing the scenes they shared. At the end of July they returned to London where Coward began to direct the production. Coward played the part of Elyot Chase himself, Adrianne Allen was his bride Sybil, Lawrence played Amanda Prynne, and Laurence Olivier was her new husband Victor. Coward wrote Sybil and Victor as minor characters, [...] "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again". He later insisted, however, that they must be credible new spouses for the lead characters: [...] "We've got to have two people as attractive as Larry and Adrianne were in the first place, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> them." ...|$|E
