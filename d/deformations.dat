The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites.

40|$|Satellite radar {{interferometry}} (InSAR) {{techniques can}} monitor the ground <b>deformation</b> with millimeter precision. With Time-series InSAR (TInSAR) methodology, the ground <b>deformation</b> time series {{can be derived}} from InSAR observations. One of the important ways to analyze the InSAR <b>deformation</b> time series is to parameterize the InSAR <b>deformation</b> time series with <b>deformation</b> models. The previous ways of modelling InSAR <b>deformation</b> time series are usually point-wise, i. e. they focus on the <b>deformation</b> models of single InSAR measurement points. The <b>deformation</b> model of each point is either assumed to be a linear function of time, or is selected from the predefined alternative models. The point-wise modeling methodologies can well interpret the <b>deformation</b> behavior of each point, but is limited on modeling the spatial <b>deformation</b> patterns. In this study, we design and implement methodologies to model the spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> patterns, based on given spatial smoothness information of the <b>deformation.</b> We introduce a work flow to digest the spatial smoothness information from external sources, and use the information to improve the functional and stochastic model. We also propose a model selection methodology based on hypothesis testing to select the the most probable spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> model from given potential models. The spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> modeling methodology is applied to the simulated data, as well as the real InSAR measurements. We apply the spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> methodology to study the <b>deformation</b> in a hydrocarbon production field in California, and successfully detect the instantaneous uplifting and subsiding events. Based on the simulation and real case study, we conclude that given proper contextual information, spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> modeling is able to derive the <b>deformation</b> model in both temporal and spatial domain, and has a good performance on parameterizing the non-linear <b>deformation</b> behavior in the temporal domain...|$|R

40|$|When a {{material}} {{is subjected to}} an applied stress, the material will experience recoverable elastic <b>deformation</b> followed by permanent plastic <b>deformation</b> at the point when the applied stress exceeds the yield stress of the material. Microscopically, {{the onset of the}} plasticity usually indicates the activation of dislocation motion, which is considered to be the primary mechanism of plastic <b>deformation.</b> Once plastic <b>deformation</b> is initiated, further elastic <b>deformation</b> is negligible owing to the limited increase in the flow stress caused by work hardening. Here we present experimental evidence and quantitative analysis of simultaneous development of significant elastic <b>deformation</b> and dislocation-based plastic <b>deformation</b> in single crystal GaAs nanowires (NWs) under bending <b>deformation</b> up to a total strain of ~ 6 %.

30|$|Dam <b>deformation</b> zoning {{analysis}} has to address two key problems: (1) determining the statistical magnitude {{that can be}} used to represent the <b>deformation</b> similarity between measuring points and (2) determining the specific systematic zoning method to be used, that is, the criteria to be used to determine <b>deformation</b> similarity between different dam regions. The criteria that would determine the <b>deformation</b> similarity of different dam regions were constructed based on the panel features of super-high arch dam <b>deformation</b> combined with spatial–temporal information of <b>deformation.</b> The criteria created the <b>deformation</b> zoning method for the super-high arch dam by studying structural <b>deformation</b> behavior in time dimension and cross-section dimension.|$|R
