25|$|Petroleum {{and natural}} gas are formed by the {{anaerobic}} decomposition of remains of organisms including phytoplankton and zooplankton that settled to the sea (or lake) bottom in large quantities under anoxic conditions, millions of years ago. Over geological time, this organic matter, mixed with mud, got buried under heavy layers of sediment. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter, first into a waxy material known as kerogen which is found in oil shales, and then with more heat into liquid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in {{a process known as}} catagenesis. Despite these heat driven transformations (which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter), the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin.|$|E
25|$|Petroleum is {{a fossil}} fuel derived from ancient fossilized organic materials, such as {{zooplankton}} and algae. Vast quantities of these remains settled to sea or lake bottoms, mixing with sediments and being buried under anoxic conditions (no oxygen). As further layers settled {{to the sea}} or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions. This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, which is found in various oil shales around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> via {{a process known as}} catagenesis. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon pyrolysis in a variety of mainly endothermic reactions at high temperature or pressure, or both.|$|E
25|$|After methane, ethane is {{the second-largest}} {{component}} of natural gas. Natural gas from different gas fields varies in ethane content {{from less than}} 1% to more than 6% by volume. Prior to the 1960s, ethane and larger molecules were typically not separated from the methane component of natural gas, but simply burnt along with the methane as a fuel. Today, ethane is an important petrochemical feedstock and is separated from the other components of natural gas in most well-developed gas fields. Ethane can also be separated from petroleum gas, a mixture of <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining. Economics of building and running processing plants can change, however. If the relative value of sending the unprocessed natural gas to a consumer exceeds the value of extracting ethane, ethane extraction might not be run, which could cause operational issues managing the changing quality of the gas in downstream systems.|$|E

30|$|The {{process for}} the {{extraction}} of <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> products from the hydropyrolytic depolymerisation of waste LDPE, MDPE and HDPE mix type of polyethylene is described in this paper. The experimentation of the extraction of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuel from waste polyethylene is carried out on a lab scale basis. The temperature versus yield graph is also described in this paper, which depicts {{the increase in the}} yield of the gaseous fuel with temperature is obtained up to certain temperature, but at certain higher temperature the yield of the gaseous fuel decreases. The component analysis of the products with Gas Chromatographs is carried out and the <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gaseous</b> products were compared with the conventional liquefied petroleum gas components. The paper produces some scope for the possibilities of production of C 3 and C 4 components as useful domestic and industrial fuel. The chromatographic study, reveal that more than 29  % of the total volume of the gas component is C 3. This is also evident for the production of higher calorific value products from the hydropyrolytic process of depolymerisation of waste polyethylene. The stripping of the C 1 and C 2 components from the above gaseous fuel {{can be used as a}} fuel gas in furnaces. The paper also provides information regarding the percentage of the gaseous fuel extracted from waste polyethylene. The scope for generating a source for an alternative fuel is well reveled in this paper.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} hydrogenation {{is that of}} platinum catalyzed {{addition of}} hydrogen to oxygen in the Döbereiner's lamp, a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist Paul Sabatier is considered {{the father of the}} hydrogenation process. In 1897, building on the earlier work of James Boyce, an American chemist working in the manufacture of soap products, he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in what is now known as the Sabatier process. For this work, Sabatier shared the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Wilhelm Normann was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils, which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry. The commercially important Haber–Bosch process, first described in 1905, involves hydrogenation of nitrogen. In the Fischer–Tropsch process, reported in 1922 carbon monoxide, which is easily derived from coal, is hydrogenated to liquid fuels.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to look at converting methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons because the worlds 2 ̆ 7 supply of natural gas {{is equivalent to the}} worlds 2 ̆ 7 crude oil reserves. There are known processes such as the Fischer Tropsch process that can convert methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons but this process and other known processes are generally multistep processes. The study of using methane plasmas to produce larger molecular weight hydrocarbons {{is important}} because the plasma process converts methane to larger molecular weight hydrocarbons in a single step. ^ A methane plasma can produce liquid, polymeric, and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> products. Previous plasma research has focused on characterizing only one product. In this study all the products that form in a methane plasma in both a microwave plasma and in a tubular dielectric barrier discharge reactor were studied. A new sampling system was developed for the microwave plasma system to better determine product selectivity and conversion. ^ Using the new sampling system the overall conversion of methane in both plasma systems could be modeled as a zero order plug flow reactor. The reaction rate constant was modified to be dependent on pressure and voltage or power. The modifications to the reaction rate constants were consistent with Huang and Suib. ^ Previous plasma studies reported either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. Only one person has been able to produce either ethane or acetylene as the most abundant <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gaseous</b> product. The microwave plasma system was able to produce either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. The specific energy (kJ/mole) of methane was important in determining whether ethane or acetylene is the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. ^ In microwave systems, high surface area catalysts have been used to convert methane into larger hydrocarbons. In the tubular reactor the electrode was coated with different metals and even though the electrode had a relatively low surface area catalytic affects have been reported for water splitting, CO 2 decomposition, and NO reduction. By studying all the products and reactor conditions the specific energy of the tubular reactor was reduced to prevent polymer formation so that a catalytic effect was found with methane by using electrodes of different metals. A catalytic cycle was also demonstrated in the plasma system, which no plasma catalyst study had ever reported. ...|$|R

As the formation consists of both kerogen type II–III and type III, {{there will be a}} mixture of both oil and gas in the hydrocarbon generation and this is reflected in Fig.  17. A transformation ratio of 12 % shows that until the present, the Taratu Formation has expelled more oil relative to gas as the oil window has been reached in 51  Ma upon thermal maturity. This also confirms the presence of kerogen type II/III and III present in the Taratu Formation. There was a rapid production of liquid hydrocarbon taking place from 68  Ma, with a concentration of 54  mg HC/g TOC (Fig.  17).

Three different mineral samples were used: a pyrite concentrate, a chalcopyrite concentrate and a copper sulphide ore rock from El Teniente mine, Chile, containing 1. 2 % copper. Mineral samples were bioleached in 250 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of basal medium inoculated either with a pure strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans or a natural bacteria consortium obtained from the acid leaching of the El Teniente copper ore in columns. Each sealed shake flask system was fed with a flow of synthetic air and the exit stream was passed through a column containing an adsorbent material and next through a water trap to avoid back-contamination with air from the environment.

30|$|Vapor {{extraction}} (VAPEX) {{has been}} proposed as an alternative for heavy-oil recovery in reservoirs where thermal methods face technical and economic problems. In VAPEX, a pair of horizontal injector-producer wells is employed. The <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> solvent (normally propane or a mixture of methane–propane or propane–butane) is injected from the top well and the diluted oil drains downward by gravity to the bottom producer. Recently, the idea of incorporation of CO 2 into the <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mixture has emerged. Incorporation of CO 2 is believed to make the process more economical and environmentally and technically attractive. CO 2 is cheaper than the hydrocarbon gases and has higher solubility into the heavy oil {{than most of the}} hydrocarbon gases. It also adds value to the environmental side of the process as CO 2 can be sequestered while improving the VAPEX performance at the same time. Moreover, the addition of CO 2 to the injected gas increases the dew point of the solvent mixture, and solvent mixtures with higher dew point can be used in heavy-oil reservoirs with higher pressure in which the mixture of hydrocarbon gases may partly condense, which decreases the VAPEX efficacy. Thus, the advantage of incorporating CO 2 into the injected solvent is threefold. The objective of this work, therefore, is to simulate the performance of the VAPEX process when different solvent mixtures, including hydrocarbon gases and CO 2, are incorporated with the aim of improving its performance. The design and the major results of the simulation for the CO 2 -based VAPEX process are discussed.|$|R
