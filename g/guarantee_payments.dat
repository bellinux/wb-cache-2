50|$|By 1915, {{the line}} was opened from Squamish 176 mi north to Chasm. The railway was {{starting}} {{to run out of}} money, however. In 1915 it failed to make an interest payment on its bonds, obliging the provincial government to make good on its bond guarantee. In the 1916 provincial election campaign, the Liberal Party alleged that some of the money advanced to the railway for bond <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> had instead gone into Conservative Party campaign funds. In the election, the Conservatives, who had won every seat in the legislature in 1912 election, lost to the Liberals. The Liberals then took Foley, Welch, and Stewart to court to recover $5 million of allegedly unaccounted funds. In early 1918, the railway's backers agreed to pay the government $1.1 million and turn the railway over to the government.|$|E

50|$|The Training Opportunities Scheme, {{under which}} more than 90,000 people {{completed}} their training in 1976 and which catered mainly for people over 19 years old, was extended during 1977 to include provisions for training persons for self-employment. In addition, technician training was extended and the network of skillcentres continued to expand. In August 1977, a scheme for voluntary early retirement {{was introduced in the}} coal industry for men aged 62 or more with 20 or more year's underground service, with weekly payments up to normal pensionable age. In January 1977, unions became authorized to lodge a claim on behalf of workers with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service for an improvement in terms and conditions of employment on the grounds that existing terms and conditions were less favourable than the relevant recognized terms and conditions for the trade in the area or, where these did not exist, the general level. In February, sections of the Employment Act 1975 were brought into operation dealing with the qualifying hours for part-time work, thereby entitling large numbers of part-time workers to the same rights and job security as full-time workers. Also in February, employees became entitled to receive <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> from their employers when laid off or on short time, while in April sections of the 1975 Employment Act were activated giving employees the right to paid time off work in order to perform certain public duties. The main provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976 came into force in June 1977, making it unlawful for an employer to discriminate in recruitment or dismissal or in the treatment of existing employees in matters of promotion, transfer, training or other benefits on the grounds of nationality, race, colour, colour, or ethic or national origins. A Commission for Racial Equality was established to work towards the elimination of discrimination the promotion of equality of opportunity, and good relations between persons of different racial groups.|$|E

SBA's guaranteed portion on these loans was approximately $ 28. 8 million. Of the total population of 170 loans, 74 loans defaulted, 55 of which (74 percent) originated from four lenders that had the highest loan volume and default rates on loans to the franchisees. SBA made <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> of around $ 11 million on the defaulted loans to franchisees, including about $ 8. 5 million in <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> on the 55 defaulted loans from these four lenders. Of the 88 loans reviewed from the four lenders, 55 (63 percent) defaulted. In comparison, 19 of the 82 loans (23 percent) that originated at the other 50 lenders to the franchisees defaulted. As part of GAO's investigative work, GAO interviewed the owners of 22 franchisees of the franchise organization in GAO's review, of which 16 defaulted on their loans and 10 filed for bankruptcy protection. Interviewed franchisees noted difficulties meeting anticipated revenue estimates and limited access to information that would aid in business planning. ...|$|E

The results are developed under the realistic assumption that the losses created by insurer default are allocated among policyholders following an ex post, pro rata, sharing rule.

Moreover, capital and related costs are allocated across lines in proportion to each line’s share of a digital default option on the insurer.

In a friction-free setting, an insurance company covering multiple insurance lines can hold sufficient capital to <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> of all claims {{since there is no}} lost opportunity cost to holding additional capital.

In addition, some distributions {{made by a}} partnership in liquidation of a partner 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the partnership are treated as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payments.</b> A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment</b> constitutes ordinary income to the partner, and the partnership is allowed a deduction for the payment unless it constitutes a capital expenditure.

The principal focus of this article is on whether a partnership will recognize a gain or loss if it uses appreciated or depreciated property to make a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment.</b> There is no case or ruling that deals with that question. The authors conclude that: (1) the partnership does not recognize gain or loss on making a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment</b> in kind, (2) the partner 2 ̆ 7 s basis in the distributed property nevertheless equals its fair market value, and (3) the payment has no effect on the partner 2 ̆ 7 s basis in his partnership interest other than the reduction of that basis for the partner 2 ̆ 7 s share of the deduction allowed to the partnership for making the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment...</b>|$|R

40|$|The crisis {{recovery}} program in Indonesia has failed badly {{in relation to}} the two key objectives of development economics policy-making: efficiency and equity. The economy went into a very severe recession within a few months of the IMF appearing on the scene, and five years later output was still only at approximately the pre-crisis level. The collapse of the banking system and the associated bailout of depositors by the government has had the effect of imposing a loss on the general public, and the poor in particular, of the order of 40 % of GDP. This paper describes the collapse of the banking system and the policies the government has followed in response to it, under advice from the IMF. It then goes on to propose an alternative scheme that might have been followed-and that could be followed in future banking crises-the twin objectives of which are to maintain the integrity of the payments system while avoiding inequitable wealth transfers that result from government bailouts of banks and their depositors. banking crisis, lender of last resort, deposit <b>guarantee,</b> <b>payments</b> system. ...|$|E
40|$|The recent market {{downturn}} {{highlighted the}} substantial impact that capital markets fluctuations {{can have on}} retirement wealth. A possible strategy to manage investment risk is to purchase guarantees (i. e. put options), which can be fairly expensive. As an alternative, this paper suggests that an individual can self-insure against poor market outcomes by adjusting his retirement date {{as a function of}} market returns. To analyze this strategy, we introduce an endogenous retirement date in Merton’s (1971) optional consumption and portfolio choice model. We show that with a flexible retirement date, the worker can effectively guarantee that his retirement wealth will not drop below an endogenously determined floor. The presence of this self-insurance may crowd out the demand for guarantees, which is consistent with the relatively small size of that market. In that context, our analysis suggests that an interesting guarantee design would make the <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> contingent on the individual’s inability to work. Our analysis also reveals that a flexible retirement date increases the worker’s risk tolerance and allows him to invest a higher proportion of his wealth in risky assets. However, when the individual retires, this increased risk tolerance disappears and our results indicate that the new retiree should suddenly switch to a more prudent investment strategy...|$|E
40|$|Solving Australia’s {{long-term}} unemployment {{problem will}} take more than just another quick fix, writes John Quiggin EVERY year, it seems, we read of another restructuring of the Jobs Network, the competitively tendered replacement for the Commonwealth Employment Service that began operation in May 1998. The first round of reforms, announced in 1998 and 1999, was presented as resolving ‘teething difficulties’. In 2000 and 2001, ‘phantom jobs’ scandal, when employment agencies were found to be placing their clients in short-term jobs with associated labour hire-firms and pocketing a success fee that exceeded the wages paid to the clients. Now the government has been forced to <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> to the agencies, regardless of whether targets are met. This completely undermines the payment-by-results logic used to justify contracting out. None of this would matter if the system actually placed unemployed workers in long-term sustainable jobs. When the unemployment rate fell to 6 per cent in mid- 2000, two years after the launch of the scheme, there were loud claims that the Network was working. Three years later, despite macroeconomic performance widely acclaimed as miraculous, the unemployment rate remains stuck at 6. 2 per cent. In the eight years since Labor’s 1995 budget cut the Working Nation program of employment assistance, the unemployment rate has fallen by only 2 percentage points, despite nearly continuous expansion in output. The contrast between growing GDP and static unemployment rates suggests the Jobs Network is not doing its job. Even the government’s own reports, such as that issued by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in September, now admit that the Jobs Network has been almost totally ineffective in assisting the long-term unemployed. The only defence offered is that, based on several statistical measures, the previous government’s programs were equally ineffective and cost more to run. In the short term, the existence of a large pool of unemployed workers has some benefits. The unemployed keep other workers on their toes, a concept enshrined in the idea of a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. But, as the past 25 years has shown, the reserve army of the unemployed suffers from high wastage rates, as long-term unemployed workers withdraw from the labour force and the total supply of labour declines. Until now, the adverse effects of this decline have been masked by the bulge in labour supply arising from the baby boom. But with the first baby boomers now approaching their 60 s, the costs of past policies will soon become clear. The Business Council of Australia is finally waking up to this fact and is urging its members to change negative attitudes towards older workers. But much more extensive changes are needed. Almost every aspect of Australian labour market policy seems calculated to destroy human capital rather than build it. Damage is being done {{at both ends of the}} age range and, for that matter, in the middle as well. Since the Kemp-Vanstone cuts of 1996, the number of Australian students commencing higher education has been virtually static, and the quality of the education they receive has declined. School completion rates are only just recovering from the damage done by Kennett and Keating earlier in the 1990 s. The steady growth in average education levels needed to keep pace with the rest of the world is simply not taking place. Employers have sought, and gained, the flexibility to dismiss full-time ‘permanent’ employees and replace them with casuals or contractors who are employed on an ‘at will’ basis. This inevitably exposes many more people to the risk of becoming unemployed. And, with few new full-time jobs, the proportion of unemployed who become long-term unemployed is inevitably high. Without a serious commitment to active labour market policies, the natural outcome of long-term unemployment is withdrawal from the labour force. Rather than make a serious effort to reduce long-term unemployment, we have the cheap populism of ‘work for the dole’ and the ideological cost-cutting of the Jobs Network. A 6 per cent unemployment rate and declining full-time employment rates are pretty miserable outcomes for a country that has experienced both favourable demographics and one of the longest sustained economic expansions in its history. Things will be far worse when demography turns against us and when our macro-economic luck runs out, as it inevitably will.
