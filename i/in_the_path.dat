Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) {{from the city and}} an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 miles) of the city.|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary {{in the way}} they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E

Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established {{to help people}} {{in the wake of the}} storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand {{was sent}} to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom as Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to Major General James Whiteside McCay. McCay was known as a hard task master, but he had nothing but praise for the work of Gellibrand, who helped him {{overhaul}} the organisation and the training syllabus. Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command. In April 1918, the brigade was committed to battle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the advancing German Army in the Battle of Dernancourt. The brigade held and defeated the German advance.|$|E
