25|$|One of {{the most}} <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> to be found near the city Dehloran is a natural liquid tar spring. Iranians used to use this tar to render ships and roofs {{waterproof}} about 3000 years ago. This black spring {{is located in a}} natural protected area named Abgarm. <b>Interesting</b> <b>things</b> around this area include mineral water springs, native trees, and bat caves with rare species of bats.|$|E
25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E

25|$|Light relinquishes {{ownership}} of the Death Note to Kiyomi Takada. After Takada is caught, Light kills her to recover the Death Note, but it is taken by the investigation team. L states that he will test the 13-Day Rule, a fake Death Note rule designed to prove Light and Misa's innocence. Rem, knowing that L's actions will reveal Misa's identity as the 2nd Kira, writes both L's and Watari's names in the Death Note. Light then proceeds to write his father's name in the book, manipulating his father to return the confiscated Death Note. Light confronts his father, but Soichiro does not die. The investigation team members, including L, reveal themselves. Having already written his own name in the Death Note, thus negating Rem's actions, L tells Light {{that he had just}} written in a fake note. Light tries to write on a hidden piece of Death Note, but is shot by Matsuda, an investigation team member. Light tells Ryuk to write the team's names, promising to show him many <b>interesting</b> <b>things,</b> and begins to laugh. He stops, however, when Ryuk shows him that he had written just one name: Light's. Light tries to stop Ryuk, but merely passes right through him. As Light begins to succumb to the effects of the Death Note, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to him that humans that have used the Death Note are barred from entering either Heaven or Hell, instead spending eternity in nothingness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging him to believe that he acted as Kira to put the justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice. The film concludes one year later, on Light's birthday. Sayu fetches Soichiro and says that Kira helped reduce crime rates, however, she says that she does not support Kira as Light was killed by Kira (which is what Soichiro told her).|$|E
500|$|Negative {{opinions}} about the album stemmed from its lyrical content. Some critics {{have said that the}} serious nature of the lyrics are hard to digest. Others said Dreyer's lyrics and vocals still overshadow the instrumentation. Alex Andrews of Thrash Hits gave the album a four out of six rating, saying: [...] "The flipside of Dreyer's imposing presence is that it can be all too easy to let the rest of the band fade into the background. It's a shame, because for the most part, there are some <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> happening".|$|E
500|$|On the map, several {{subtle but}} <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> can be discovered, including, in the {{northeast}} section of the cartograph, {{a reference to a}} stream flowing through Lake Victoria, then known by the missionaries as [...] "the Ukerewa". A note is present describing how the waters of the stream were very sweet, but stained the teeth a sickly yellow. This note is probably the first known text referring to the drinking water, found primarily around and of Mount Meru, which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow-brown stain to the incisors which cannot be removed.|$|E

500|$|Darren Aronofsky and {{his friend}} Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{believed}} John's {{separation from}} his sons {{throughout the season}} [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> than the boys are doing", with Kripke likewise feeling that John was keeping Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines". His death would allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly". The writers originally intended for John to die at the episode's end, with Sam and Dean surviving the crash but John dying in their arms. His death, however, was pushed back into the second-season premiere because the writers deemed it too dark to kill John after everything else the brothers had gone through in [...] "Devil's Trap".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Hands All Over" [...] is [...] "the one real gamble"; {{despite the fact}} that it tries to hard to find a missing connection between the works of Prince, Queen and Nine Inch Nails, [...] "it's certainly one of the more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> the band has ever recorded." [...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One of the <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> for the concept for this video is that {{we knew we had}} to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said {{he thought}} the episode was an improvement over the pilot episode, which he also enjoyed. Sepinwall said the episode seemed to distance the Leslie character from Michael Scott, Steve Carell's character on The Office, and gave more for the supporting cast to do; he particularly praised Schneider and Ansari. Matt Fowler of IGN said Amy Poehler [...] "remains frighteningly unflappable" [...] and said he enjoyed how disastrous the town hall meeting turned out to be, but said supporting characters like Mark and Ron [...] "need to be fleshed out a bit more and made... well, funnier." [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune said [...] "Canvassing" [...] was funnier than the pilot episode, but still lacked big laughs and [...] "I think the writers can do some <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> with the whole playground plot, among them introducing us to some of Pawnee's more colorful denizens." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play. The team {{believed}} the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E

500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a little out of time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} pilot episode, series creator Eric Kripke made several {{dramatic}} revisions to John's storyline. The {{first draft of}} the script had Sam and Dean being raised by their aunt and uncle, though this was changed when Kripke realized that the backstory became much less complicated by having John raise them on the road. Another revision had John dying {{at the end of}} the episode instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. Though he survives in the final version of the pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season that John did have to die, as they believed his separation from his sons [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> than the boys are doing." [...] Kripke also felt that John kept Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines", his death being required to allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly." [...] The writers initially intended for John to die in the car accident in [...] "Devil's Trap," [...] but they ultimately postponed his death to prevent the finale from becoming too dark. Following the character's eventual escape from Hell, executive producer Ben Edlund stated that even the writers are unsure of where John's soul ended up.|$|E

500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two-part finale.|$|E
500|$|Valve {{aimed for}} a November 1997 release {{to compete with}} Quake II. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of {{innovative}} aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level. When {{the rest of the}} team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as [...] "Die Hard meets Evil Dead", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> happen in it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, noting that it [...] "turns the complex into something easy and obvious". Shearman and Pearson felt that the character of Sara Bangs was [...] "treated as an object by the episode", and that Carter's script [...] "takes a very real issue and trivialises it" [...] by presenting such an [...] "open and shut case". However, they noted that the episode was [...] "very well acted", and was [...] "clearly well intentioned". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, noting that it [...] "tries some <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> with the Millennium template". VanDerWerff felt {{that several of the}} episode's scenes [...] "are as horrifying as anything I've seen on TV", adding that [...] "they accomplish much of this through the mere power of suggestion". However, he also noted that the character of Joe Bangs was too simplistic, claiming that he is [...] "so damned blatant about what he does that it eventually stops being horrifying and becomes preposterous". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 2.5 out of 5, finding that its focus on legal issues and counselling [...] "fragments the tone and atmosphere" [...] built by previous episodes. However, Gibron felt that [...] "Carter's script handles the horrifying subject very well".|$|E
