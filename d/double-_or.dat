5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have <b>double-</b> <b>or</b> multiple-layering of cones on {{the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E

The phase behavior showed an interesting asymmetry: Phase separation occurred immediately when small (sub-stoichiometric) amounts of cationic polyelectrolyte {{were added to the}} DNA solution, but redissolution into a single cat-(HM) HEC/DNA/H 2 O phase occurred already with a modest charge excess of the cationic polyelectrolyte, at a charge ratio approximately independent of the overall polyelectrolyte concentration. Cat-HEC/dsDNA/H 2 O and cat-HEC/ssDNA/H 2 O systems presented a considerable difference in the extension of the phase separation region. The one-phase samples with excess cationic polyelectrolyte were studied by rheology. The presence of DNA strengthened the viscoelastic behavior of the solutions of the cationic polyelectrolytes, reflected in an increase in storage modulus and viscosity. Differences in phase behavior and rheology were observed, particularly between systems containing cat-HEC or cat-HMHEC, but also between dsDNA and ssDNA. Thus, these systems allow for the preparation of DNA formulations with widely variable rheology and water uptake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In a study where older {{couples who}} had lived long lives with {{physical}} disabilities were interviewed about mutual care, an unexpected finding that while the couples reported worsening disabilities, they also described themselves as advantaged, and as maintaining {{a high level of}} activity in some areas of life. In this article, we investigate how the couples achieve this sense of ageing successfully when the participants’ stories of physical decline, from an outsider’s perspective, might be thought to produce <b>double-,</b> triple- <b>or</b> multiple jeopardy. The results show how the couples use different types of reference groups and refer to various resources to frame themselves as privileged. Furthermore, through environmental adaptations, technical aids and supportive services, they managed to maintain a high level of activity, despite living with disabilities. Notably, the couples described themselves as advantaged by referring to being older, to the long life with disabilities and to ageing with disabilities together. The overarching ambition of the article is to problematize established notions of successful ageing. Considering that the couples referred to the very conditions that might be seen as disadvantageous,  the problem of pre-defined criteria for successful ageing becomes particularly apparent.

Cells initiate the process by sending out pulsatile signals, which propagate as waves. With time, circular and spiral patterns form. We show that by adding spatial and temporal noise to the levels of an important regulator of external cAMP levels, the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, we can explain the natural progression of the system from randomly firing cells to circular waves whose symmetries break to form <b>double-</b> and single- <b>or</b> multi-armed spirals. When phosphodiesterase inhibitor is increased with time, mimicking experimental data, the wavelength of the spirals shortens, and a proportion of them evolve into pairs of connected spirals. We compare these results to recent experiments, finding that the temporal and spatial correspondence between experiment and model is very close...|$|R
40|$|The use of free vascularised bone grafts (FVBGs) is an {{infrequently}} performed {{surgical technique}} for {{the reconstruction of}} spinal defects. This field of surgery brings many challenges concerning choice of FVBG, planning of the operative procedure and selection of recipient vessels. This study aims to report our experience with FVBGs, with special emphasis on the planning and surgical technique. Over a period of 10 years (1994 - 2004), we used FVBG for anterior spinal reconstruction in 23 patients. In 21 patients, a free vascularised fibular graft was used, and in two cases a free vascularised iliac crest graft was used. The spinal segments reconstructed involved the cervical spine (4 cases), the thoracic spine (13 cases) and the thoraco-lumbar and lumbo-sacral spine (6 cases). Re-vascularisation of the FVBG proved to be technically feasible in 22 patients, but failed in one fibular graft due to difficulties with recipient vessels in the lumbar spine. When necessary, the fibula was osteotomised and folded in a <b>double-,</b> triple- <b>or</b> quadruple-barrel construction to increase {{the strength of the}} reconstruction. Technical challenges were met with respect to the choice of the recipient vessel at various anatomical sites. The use of FVBG is a valuable technique for the reconstruction of complex spinal disorders. Successful execution requires microvascular expertise with respect to graft harvesting and appropriate choice of recipient vessels. Adequate preoperative planning in a multidisciplinary setting and adherence to the basic principles for spinal reconstruction are required. © 2008 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons...|$|R

40|$|Published online: 28 June 2013 Three-dimensional exact, finite-amplitude {{solutions}} are presented {{for the problem}} of channel flow subject to a system rotation about a spanwise axis. The {{solutions are}} of travelling wave form, and may bifurcate as tertiary flows from the two-dimensional streamwise-independent secondary flow, or as secondary flows directly from the basic flow. For the tertiary flows, we consider solutions of spanwise superharmonic and subharmonic type. We distinguish flows {{on the basis of}} symmetry, originating eigenmode and major solution branch, and thus identify 15 distinct flows: 5 superharmonic tertiary, 5 subharmonic tertiary and 5 secondary flows. The tertiary flows all feature a single layer of vortical structures in the spanwise–wall-normal plane, the secondary flows feature single-, <b>double-,</b> triple- <b>or</b> quadruple-layer flow structures in this plane. All flows feature low-speed streamwise-orientated streaks in the streamwise velocity component and/or pulses of low-speed streamwise velocity. The streaks may be sinusoidal or varicose. Sinusoidal streaks are flanked by staggered streamwise vortices, varicose streaks and pulses are flanked by aligned vortices. A comparison with previous simulation and experimental studies finds that the simplest three-dimensional flows observed previously correspond to superharmonic tertiary flows bifurcating from the upper branch of the secondary flow. The mean absolute vorticity of the present flows is also considered. A flattening of the profile of this vorticity is observed in the central region of the channel for two-dimensional secondary and many of the three-dimensional flows, with two-step profiles also observed. This phenomenon is attributed to mixing of the vorticity across zones of the channel in which streamwise vortex structures exist, and is demonstrated by a two-dimensional model. The phenomenon appears to be distinct to that observed in fully turbulent rotating channel flows...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is a {{major cause}} of global {{morbidity}} and mortality, and new strategies for treating and preventing this disease are needed. The protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contributes to the annual 219 million cases and 655, 000 deaths from malaria. Gene knockouts, while central to studying this parasite, are inefficient and present a substantial bottleneck. Here we show that the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas 9 DNA endonuclease and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) made in situ using T 7 RNA polymerase (T 7 RNAP) efficiently edit the P. falciparum genome. Targeting the native knob-associated histidine-rich protein (kahrp) and erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (eba- 175) genes, we achieve high (≥ 50 – 100 %) gene disruption frequencies within the usual timeframe for generating transgenic parasites. Our results demonstrate a straightforward strategy for efficiently manipulating the P. falciparum genome to facilitate basic biological studies, and drug and vaccine development efforts in a human pathogen of major significance to global health. The most commonly used approach for modifying chromosomal loci in P. falciparum relies on spontaneous single- <b>or</b> <b>double-</b> crossover recombination using plasmids containing sequence homologous to the target region 1 – 3.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on the post-perovskite (PPV) transition’s {{possible}} dynamical effect, as well as the complex seismological structures that may arise through the interplay of variations in temperature, composition and the PPV phase transition. Here these issues are explored using numerical models of thermal and thermo-chemical convection in various geometries including a three-dimensional spherical shell. A zero-, single- <b>or</b> <b>double-</b> crossing of the PPV phase boundary is observed depending on the temperatures of the CMB and deep mantle; this evolves with time as the core and mantle cool. The PPV transition has a minor effect on the dynamics and mantle temperature, mildly destabilizing the lower boundary layer and slightly increasing mantle temperature, depending on its depth relative to the thermal boundary layer. If piles of dense subducted MORB accumulate above the CMB then there is an anticorrelation between regions with a thick PPV layer and hot dense piles, but with a composition-dependent PPV transition this can change. Lateral variations in the occurrence of PPV are likely the dominant contributor to long-wavelength lateral shear-wave velocity heterogeneity in the deepest mantle, depending on some uncertain scaling parameters. The different contributions to seismic heterogeneity have different spectral slopes: temperature is “red”, compo-sition is “white ” and PPV is intermediate. Theoretical considerations suggest that when compositional effects on the stability of PPV are taken into account, a large potential variety of complex behavior could occur, generating structures such as discontinuities, gaps or holes, and multiple (i. e.,> 2) crossings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} geometric and dosimetric {{accuracy of}} frame-less image-guided radiosurgery (IG-RS) for brain metastases. Methods and materials Single fraction IG-RS was practiced in 72 patients with 98 brain metastases. Patient positioning and immobilization used either <b>double-</b> (n[*]=[*] 71) <b>or</b> single-layer (n[*]=[*] 27) thermoplastic masks. Pre-treatment set-up errors (n[*]=[*] 98) were evaluated with cone-beam CT (CBCT) based image-guidance (IG) and were corrected in {{six degrees of}} freedom without an action level. CBCT imaging after treatment measured intra-fractional errors (n[*]=[*] 64). Pre- and post-treatment errors were simulated in the treatment planning system and target coverage and dose conformity were evaluated. Three scenarios of 0 [*]mm, 1 [*]mm and 2 [*]mm GTV-to-PTV (gross tumor volume, planning target volume) safety margins (SM) were simulated. Results Errors prior to IG were 3. 9 [*]mm[*]±[*] 1. 7 [*]mm (3 D vector) and the maximum rotational error was 1. 7 °[*]±[*] 0. 8 ° on average. The post-treatment 3 D error was 0. 9 [*]mm[*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]mm. No differences between double- and single-layer masks were observed. Intra-fractional errors were significantly correlated with the total treatment time with 0. 7 mm± 0. 5 mm and 1. 2 mm± 0. 7 mm for treatment times ≤ 23 minutes and > 23 minutes (p 5 % in 14 % of the patients. A 1 [*]mm safety margin fully compensated intra-fractional patient motion. Conclusions IG-RS with online correction of translational errors achieves high geometric and dosimetric accuracy. Intra-fractional errors decrease target coverage and conformity unless compensated with appropriate safety margins. </p...|$|R
