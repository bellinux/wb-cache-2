5|$|The birthday-number <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, {{and will}} have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} semantically related primes and phonologically similar primes were investigated. Tasks for {{processing}} targets were either lexical decision or vowel detection. SOA's (stimulus onset asynchrony) were 200 ms or 800 ms. The reaction time {{results indicated that}} semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found only in lexical decision tasks and phonological priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> only in vowel detection tasks. It was also revealed that only semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found in shorter SOA conditions, and both semantic and phonemic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> shown in longer SOA conditions. The necessity for further investigation including other factors of priming <b>effects</b> <b>was</b> suggested. 原著Original国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface using their hands.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen every March and September as {{an unusual}} shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
5|$|An {{order is}} a legal {{instrument}} that has an executive flavour and expresses an obvious command. Often, its <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> limited to a particular moment in time, rather than continuing.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> {{headache}} and constipation. The overall profile of adverse <b>effects</b> <b>is</b> {{comparable to that}} of palonosetron (see Palonosetron#Adverse effects); no common adverse <b>effects</b> can <b>be</b> attributed to netupitant.|$|R
50|$|Demcizumab {{has been}} known to cause many adverse effects in patient. The most common side <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> hypertension, fatigue, anemia, and headaches.

50|$|This {{interesting}} <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered by}} Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro in 1944. The Brazilian physicist observed that solidification and melting of many dielectrics {{are accompanied by}} charge separation. A thermo-dielectric <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated with carnauba wax, naphthalene and paraffin. Charge separation in ice was also expected. This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> observed during water freezing period, electrical storm <b>effects</b> can <b>be</b> caused by this strange phenomenon. <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> measured by many researches - Bernhard Gross, Armando Dias Tavares, Sergio Mascarenhas etc. César Lattes (co-discoverer of the pion) supposed that this <b>was</b> the only <b>effect</b> ever to <b>be</b> discovered entirely in Brasil.|$|R

5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> almost certainly present.|$|E
40|$|Two {{models of}} how interfeature causal {{knowledge}} affects classification were evaluated. First, a causal status <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> stronger for probabilistic versus deterministic causal links (Expt. 1).

5000|$|Glucocorticoids such as {{cortisol}} affect carbohydrate, fat, {{and protein}} metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive <b>effects.</b> Anti-inflammatory <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by blocking {{the action of}} inflammatory mediators (transrepression) and inducing anti-inflammatory mediators (transactivation). Immunosuppressive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by suppressing delayed hypersensitivity reactions by direct action on T-lymphocytes. Anti-proliferative <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibition of DNA synthesis and epidermal cell turnover. Vasoconstrictive <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> mediated by inhibiting the action of inflammatory mediators such as histidine.|$|R

5|$|The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> {{very small}} but {{measurable}} on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first {{observed in the}} Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E
5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse. The visual <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> the result of running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling decryption algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
50|$|In general, random <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> efficient, {{and should}} be used (over fixed effects) if the {{assumptions}} underlying them {{are believed to be}} satisfied. For random effects to work in the school example it is necessary that the school-specific <b>effects</b> <b>be</b> uncorrelated to the other covariates of the model. This can be tested by running fixed effects, then random effects, and doing a Hausman specification test. If the test rejects, then random <b>effects</b> <b>is</b> biased and fixed <b>effects</b> <b>is</b> the correct estimation procedure.|$|R
