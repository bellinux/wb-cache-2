40|$|In {{evaluation}} of the operating characteristics of mixed sampling plans (a known), the probability function, Fn(x), {{of the difference between}} the extreme value and the mean is important. Because it is an n multiple integral where n is the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of a mixed dependent sampling plan, the normal way of evaluating this probability is the recursive quadrature method. Using this method, as the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> increases, the amount of computation increases exponentially, so that this probability function becomes a bottleneck in computation. This thesis presents a Taylor-expansion method for handling the probability function for large first sample sizes with satisfactory precision, for an arbitrary given x. In such a way, the {{evaluation of}} the dependent mixed plans is extended to a larger <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> than previously available in the literature. Theoretically, the computational method presented here could be used for evaluating mixed plans of very large <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Technically, however, this method is limited, by the computer memory resources. Using the computational approach described above, a FORTRAN program that can compute the operating characteristics of mixed plans for first sample sizes of up to 50 was developed. A series of mixed dependent sampling plans were then evaluated with an accuracy of seven decimal places...|$|E

3000|$|Some {{limitations}} of the study deserve a comment. <b>First,</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was limited due to inconstant availability of CT, some unexpected early deaths and completion of research projects to which animals were originally assigned. Accuracy of CTpost-exsang. was evaluated only in three animals with pulmonary oedema, and therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Second, the volume of blood withdrawn from animals was quite variable, possibly because heparin was not used to prevent post-mortem thrombosis.

30|$|The {{present study}} has some {{limitations}} {{with regard to}} the generalizability of the findings. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was small particularly the number of anxio-depressed smokers compared to many other studies.

30|$|This {{study had}} some limitations. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> {{was small and}} the study period was only 1  year.

30|$|The {{current study}} had several {{limitations}} {{that should be}} considered. <b>First,</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> (N =  3) was small, and thus {{we may not have}} represented all of the different lateral condyle fracture patterns that are seen in the general population. That is, the study was limited to one type of fracture pattern, which may not thoroughly represent the clinical aspects of displacement as a function of elbow motion represented in the present study. Moreover, there is large variation among cadaveric specimens in general, and the specific anatomy and geometry of the elbow in these specimens may have affected the results as well. Second, adult cadaveric specimens were used, as pediatric cadaveric specimens are unavailable in the United States for biomechanics research. Furthermore, to maintain consistency throughout testing, the forearms were rotated about two axes: the central axis of the forearm (isolating the effect of muscle pull), and the lateral edge of the hand (inducing varus bending). Despite showing minimal differences during these rotations, the experimental setup may have overly limited the forces. When a patient pronates his arm, the medial aspect of the forearm does not remain fixed, and the result is a hinged pronation with a much greater arc length. As a result, higher varus bending may be seen clinically, resulting in larger forces, thus affecting fracture displacement more so than shown in this study.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to this study. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> {{is small and}} spans {{a long period of}} time. In future studies, we will enrol more participants from multiple centres. Secondly, the transmission direction of seroconcordant couples who lacked epidemic data were obtained from questionnaires; in future studies, proper mathematic models should be used to identify the direction (Yang et al. 2012). Lastly, this is a small-scale study using convenient samples. Future studies with larger <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> are warranted.|$|R
30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} {{of our study}}. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of our study was rather small. However, {{this is the first}} prospective study investigating the prognostic impact of ICG-PDR in critically ill patients with life-threatening acute and chronic liver diseases. Second, this study was conducted at a medical ICU of a university hospital. Thus, conclusions drawn in this study may not be generalizable to patients treated in surgical or tertiary care hospital wards.|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} a number of {{important}} limitations. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is relatively small. Second, this was a single-center study at an academic medical center with a significant number of end-stage liver disease patients, and thus there may be some availability bias [16], though this should have affected the physical and ultrasound exams equally. In addition, no history was taken and history-taking influences the accuracy of the physical examination [17]. Finally, the radiologist interpreting the images may not have used the most accurate measurement methods in his or her interpretation of the radiologic study, leading to a suboptimal reference standard.|$|R
30|$|No {{studies are}} without limitations. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> (reflecting the {{graduate}} class size at the institution where {{the participants were}} recruited), debate topics, and task types {{of this study were}} all variables that could have affected oral production and strategy use. Small-sample studies may also limit the use of statistical tools to make generalizable quantitative statements; nonetheless, they can still contribute to meta-analytic results that may be generalized with confidence. As for topic familiarity, although the topics were sourced from standardized instruments and there were preferences for task types, the topics resembled what graduate students commonly encounter when communicating in academic settings.|$|R
30|$|Several {{limitations}} {{of the present study}} must be noted. <b>First,</b> the study <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was small. Second, the participants included only female handball players, making it difficult to apply these results more broadly. In future research, an examination of joint torques will also be necessary. Further, investigating cutting and turning at angles and directions other than those {{used in the present study}} will be necessary.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} has some limitations, {{which should be}} considered. <b>First,</b> the study <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was small, thus there might be effects on {{generalization}} of our findings.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} {{in the study}} that indicate a need for caution. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was modest (although comparable to similar studies), meaning that the study might have lacked sufficient power to detect some significant results. In addition, while the groups were matched on age, education level, and number of medications taken (in {{the case of the}} patient groups), they differed on cognitive ability, visual acuity, disease duration, and diagnosis (there was a higher proportion of patients with Parkinson’s dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies in the hallucinating group). There were also significantly more men in the hallucinating group. The influence of these variables cannot be ruled out.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study was}} {{designed}} as a proof-of-principle feasibility study. However, there were several noteworthy study limitations that deserve consideration. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of our study was small. Second, with the exception of RAS enhancements which did incorporate patient blinding, the study was largely un-blinded. Third, despite our randomized design, imbalances in baseline characteristics existed across groups. While such imbalances were not statistically significant per se, it is possible that residual confounding may have existed and accounted for some or all of our results. Finally, differences in music preferences, genres and music tempos may have partially explained the variations in exercise adherence between RAS and non-RAS groups [18, 54, 55].|$|R
30|$|Certain {{limitations}} {{to this study}} should be considered. <b>First,</b> small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> might be disadvantage in achieving the statistical significance about the independent correlates of EATT and CIMT {{as well as to}} apply results of the present regression models to the entire population. Secondly, with the exception of hs-CRP, our study was lacking other oxidative stress markers. Thirdly, in our study, we only include patients with normotensive ADPKD with normal renal function, and excluded any other form of ADPKD. Another limitation is lack of long-term follow-up of patients in terms of cardiovascular events. Finally, the cross-sectional design made it impossible to establish any cause and effect relationships.|$|R
30|$|Findings {{from the}} current study need to be {{considered}} alongside several key limitations. <b>First,</b> our <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was fairly small, which reduced statistical power. Further, the small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> precluded analyses that assess whether scientist identity and mentoring behaviors vary {{as a function of the}} sociodemographic breakdown within the mentoring relationship (for discussion, see Blake-Beard et al. 2011; Ensher and Murphy 1997). For instance, it would be interesting to know whether the association between mentoring and scientist identity varies in strength depending on whether the mentor and student share the same ethnic or gender identity. Relatedly, findings {{from the current}} study revealed a tendency—particularly among men—for students and their mentors to have the same gender identity. Future research should attempt to explain why this is the case and examine whether mentoring practices differ based on the gender composition of the dyad.|$|R
30|$|Some {{limitations}} {{should be}} considered when interpreting our results. <b>First,</b> despite our <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> we had {{a limited number of}} BC cases (n[*]=[*] 9) in the KTRs population. Second, the median follow-up period for the KTRs with BC was inadequate. Finally, this was a retrospective study; therefore, we could not control for all confounding variables. However, it is notable {{that this is the first}} study to evaluate the incidence of BC in Japanese KTRs.|$|R
30|$|Based on <b>first</b> 30 cases, <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was {{calculated}} to be 71 for detecting {{the diameter of}} aortic annulus at the significant level of 0.05 with a statistical power of 80 %. Thus, we included 74 cases to clear the <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Data were expressed as means[*]±[*]SD or as a median range and interquartile range as appropriate. To predict the difficulty of PAC placement from the factors, a multiple linear regression was conducted. Factors included in multiple linear regression analysis were selected among variables yielding P[*]<[*] 0.1 by simple linear regression analysis. All analyses were conducted with SPSS (IBM Corporation, USA) version 14.0. P[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statically significant.|$|R
30|$|After {{approval}} from the Institutional Review Board, participants were recruited for the study through advertisements in local news media in a U.S. mid-western city in 2011. The recruitment statements clearly showed that {{we were looking for}} “apparel shoppers” to ensure the participants were prepared to engage in apparel shopping situations during the data collection. A large retailer’s gift card for the amount of $ 15 was given as an incentive. In total, 76 participants were recruited. The data from nine participants were unusable; therefore, 67 participants were used for further analysis. This design met the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> requirements suggested by Hair and his colleagues (2006). <b>First,</b> the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> per cell was greater than the number of dependent variables. Second, the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of 67 exceeded the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> per cell, 20, for repeated measure design (Hair et al. 2006).|$|R
30|$|Several {{limitations}} {{might have}} influenced {{the results of this}} study. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> may be considered limited for constructing age-specific percentile curves and a reference table. The limited <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> may be compensated for by the absence of gender differences of CIMT. Second, we could not exclude healthy reference controls with latent CRFs including dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Third, as the representative age for transformation, we applied not the individual ages but {{the mean age of the}} study population derived from each article, ignoring the age distribution of the subjects. Fourth, there is no published database focused on the childhood CIMT across race/ethnicity, age, and gender as yet. We could not perform accurate comparison across these variables between KD patients and controls. Finally, although the reproducibility of CIMT measurements should be strictly monitored to identify a subtle change of this parameter with age, we are unsure as to how the quality controls were being performed at each institute. These results should thus be interpreted with caution.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study has}} certain limitations. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> {{included}} is limited, thereby preventing us to fully investigate the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the urinary electrolyte alterations observed. Second, {{due to the}} retrospective and observational nature of the study, we cannot exclude the effects of possible confounding factors, which {{we were not able}} to control. Nonetheless, the consistency of the urinary data observed supports the solidity and the biological plausibility of the findings observed. Third, since plasma creatinine is clinically assessed once daily, GFR was estimated, and not directly calculated, therefore partially limiting the accuracy of electrolyte Fe calculations. Finally, no direct data were obtained on the activation of either ANP/BNP or the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in parallel with furosemide administration.|$|R
40|$|Control charts are {{designed}} to monitor population parameters. Selection of a control chart sampling plan involves determination of the frequency of <b>samples,</b> <b>size</b> of each <b>sample,</b> and critical values to determine when the system is sending an out-of-control signal. Since the main use of control charts is in industry, a widely accepted measure of a good sampling plan is one that minimizes {{the total cost of}} operating the system per unit time. Methods for selection of control chart sampling plans for economically optimal X charts are well established. These plans focus on single stage sampling at each sampling period. However, some populations naturally call for two stage sampling. Here, the cost of operating a system per unit time is redefined in terms of two stage sampling plans, and computer search techniques are developed to determine the con-trol chart parameters. <b>First</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> and critical values are fixed, and Newton's method is used to determine the optimal time between samples. Then, a Hooke- Jeeves search is used to simultaneously determine the optimal critical value, <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> and time between samples. Adjustment to the latter is required when...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a method to}} {{investigate}} the efficiency of two-stage adaptive designs from a theoretical point of view.

The results enables one to compare the performance of adaptive designs with non-adaptive designs, without having to rely on extensive simulation studies. We demonstrate that their relative efficiency depends sensitively on the statistical problem under investigation and derive some general conclusions when to prefer an adaptive or a non-adaptive design. In particular, we show that in nonlinear regression models with moderate or large variances the <b>first</b> stage <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of an adaptive design should be chosen sufficiently large in order to address variability in the interim parameter estimates.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} {{in this study}} that warrant discussion. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was small. The concurrent measurements of PAF and PAFAH activity would be more meaningful. As our study was retrospective, concurrent measurements of PAF and PAFAH levels were not feasible. Another limitation is that the definition and the inclusion criteria for NEC was strictly based on diagnostic coding, the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th revision, Clinical Modification, 2009; ICD- 9 -CM. Even though very desirable, pertinent clinical information such as feeding history, sepsis, presence of patent ductus arteriosus, use of inotropes, indomethacin, etc. which {{play a vital role in}} the etio-pathogenesis of NEC were not taken for analysis due to unavailability. Our study sample did not have advanced stages of NEC such as stage 3 NEC (NEC with intestinal perforation or NEC with pneumatosis with perforation) or infants who died from NEC which is also a limitation.|$|R
30|$|We must {{acknowledge}} some {{limitations of the}} present study. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was relatively small for a single referral hospital. Second, IBD patients with sleep disturbances were using more sleep medications than IBD patients without sleep disturbances. However, the univariate analysis revealed {{that the use of}} sleep medications was not associated with disease flare within 1  year from enrollment. Third, a consensus on the definition of disease flare of IBD has not been reached yet. The definition of disease flare, as well as the relatively short follow-up period, we adopted in the present study might have affected the present results. A long-term follow up study is deemed necessary to further confirm our results. Fourth, several studies showed that both a depressive mode and anxiety disorders are associated with sleep disturbances (Benhayon et al. 2013) and IBD flare-ups (Pariante and Miller 2001). Future studies should include these factors.|$|R
30|$|There {{were several}} {{potential}} limitations of our study. <b>First,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was small but {{in accordance with}} the animal research principles regarding the utilization of the lowest number of animals possible. Second, as an experimental study, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to the clinic; however, our results can serve as an important guide to building the rationale of CRRT during hypercapnia. Third, we did not assess the long-term effects of elevated PaCO 2 levels on physiology and outcomes, which requires further extensive discussion [36]; this limitation would have been mitigated if we found a significant difference in PaCO 2 between the groups. Fourth, we only studied healthy lungs, which, although they were severely hypoventilated, had preserved alveolocapillary membranes. Fifth, our model of kidney injury induction may cause an inflammatory response and hypercatabolism; however, this response is only found in acute and critically ill subjects. Finally, blinding was not possible because the investigators were responsible for preparing the dialysate solution.|$|R
