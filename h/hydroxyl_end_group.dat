40|$|Pegylation using heterotelechelic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) {{offers many}} {{possibilities}} to create high-performance molecules and materials. A versatile route is proposed to synthesize heterobifunctional PEG containing diverse combinations of azide, amine, thioacetate, thiol, pyridyl disulﬁde, {{as well as}} activated hydroxyl end groups. Asymmetric activation of one <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> enables the heterobifunctionalization while applying selective monotosylation of linear, symmetrical PEG as a key step. The azide function is introduced by reacting monotosyl PEG with sodium azide. A thiol end group is obtained by reaction with sodium hydrosulfide. The activation of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> and subsequent reaction with potassium carbonate/thioacetic acid yields a thioacetate end group. The hydrolysis of the thioester end group by ammonia in presence of 2, 2 ′-dipyridyl disulfide provides PEG pyridyl disulﬁde. Amine terminated PEG is prepared either by reduction of the azide or by nucleophilic substitution of mesylate terminated PEG using ammonia. In all cases, > 95 % functionalization of the PEG end groups is achieved. The PEG derivatives particularly support the development of materials for biomedical applications. For example, grafting up to 13 % of the Na-alg monomer units with α-amine-ω-thiol PEG maintains the gelling capacity in presence of calcium ions but simultaneous, spontaneous disulfide bond formation reinforces the initial physical hydrogel...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structures of}} complexes between bovine plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and three retinol analogs with different end groups (fenretinide, all-trans retinoic acid, and axerophthene) have {{been determined to}} 1. 8 - 1. 9 -Angstrom resolution. Their models {{are very similar to}} that of the bovine retinol. RBP complex: the root mean square deviations between equivalent alpha-carbons in the two proteins range from 0. 17 to 0. 24 Angstrom. The retinoid molecules fit in the beta-barrel cavity assuming the same conformation of the vitamin, and the substitutions have no consequences on the overall protein structure. While confirming that an intact <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> is not an absolute requirement for a correct retinoid binding to RBP, this study has shown the occurrence of conformational changes, although limited, in the rather flexible loop region at the entrance of the beta-barrel upon fenretinide and retinoic acid binding. These changes are suitable for accommodating the end groups of the above retinoids. Instead, no such changes have been revealed in RBP complexed with axerophthene, a retinol analog bearing a hydrogen atom in place of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group,</b> The protein conformational changes in the above loop region, the steric hindrance of bulky end groups of bound retinoids, and the lack of the retinol hydroxyl group appear to be responsible for the possible reduced affinity of retinoids for RBP relative to retinol and, at the same time, for the abolished or reduced affinity of retinoid.

The morphology adjustment of amorphous epoxy based copolymers and partially crystalline polymer alloys {{is carried out}} with star-shaped poly(ε-caprolactone) (SPCL) bearing various numbers of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> These <b>hydroxyl</b> groups {{are known for their}} reactivity toward epoxides following the activated monomer (AM) mechanism. For this reason, four-armed SPCL was synthesized with four <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> (SPCL-tetraol) and, in addition, with successively esterified ones down to a SPCL with four ester <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> (SPCL-tetraester). SPCL species bearing fewer or no <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> segregate into needle-like nanodomains within the epoxy networks and, if the concentration is high enough, also into crystalline domains. The stronger phase separation of SPCL-tetraester within the epoxy network compared with SPCL-tetraol is due to a reduction of the AM mechanism. The mechanical properties resulting from different morphologies lead to a trade-off between higher storage moduli and Tg values {{in the case of the}} more phase separated (and partially crystalline) polymer alloys and higher strain at break in the case of the amorphous copolymers. Nevertheless, in both cases toughness is improved or at least kept on the same level as for the pure epoxy resin...|$|R

The process conditions in the TGA were such that the weight loss curves obtained from the TGA could be correlated uniquely and directly to the forward polycondensation reaction kinetics due {{to the absence of}} (1) mass transfer limitations in the removal of 1, 4 butanediol from the melt, and (2) degradation reactions.

30|$|The {{other method}} to prepare electrospun polymer nanofibers {{decorated}} with Ag nanoparticles involves first dissolving the Ag precursor into the polymer precursor solution or attaching {{it onto the}} surface of the electrospun polymer nanofibers, followed by a reduction process which transforms the Ag precursor into Ag nanostructures. This method is also called the in situ growth of plasmonic nanoparticles. Generally, to perform the reduction reaction, one of the approaches is to utilize a reducing polymer or mixed polymer that contains a reducing polymer as the electrospun nanofiber precursor such as chitosan and PVP [88, 89 – 91]. The exact mechanism of how the PVP reduces Ag precursor into Ag nanoparticles is still not fully understood, and it has been hypothesized that the aldehyde functional groups, resulting from the oxidation of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group,</b> might reduce the metal ions in a similar way to that of Tollen’s reagent [92]. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the metal formation capacity is highly dependent on the molecule weight of PVP when the same mass of polymer is used [88]. Other approaches to reduce Ag+ in or outside the polymer nanofibers include heating, UV irradiation, microwave irradiation, or hydrogen reduction [93 – 97].

First, free radical copolymerization (FRP) (in {{absence of any}} chain transfer agent, CTA) of VDF with 1234 yf was investigated in different experimental conditions: varying the comonomer feed ([VDF] 0 /[1234 yf] 0) ratio led to several poly(VDF-co- 1234 yf) copolymers with molecular weights (Mns) ranging between 4600 and 12400 g·mol- 1 and dispersities (Ð) of ca. 2. 05, and fair to good conversions (45 - 77 %). Thermoplastic crystalline powders were obtained when mol % VDF in the copolymers was higher than 85 %, while amorphous copolymers contained a lower mol % VDF. This study also reports {{for the first time}} the determination of reactivity ratios (rVDF= 0. 76 ± 0. 34 and r 1234 yf = 1. 23 ± 0. 17 at 74 °C).

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{additives}} and their concentrations on the laccase activity and its activation rate were also investigated. The {{results show that}} PEG- 8000 was the most appropriate additive for laccase activity, followed by glycerol, while the addition of CuSO 4 resulted by a decrease of the enzyme activity. Stepanova et al. (2003) reported that the addition of various salts (10 − 3 – 10 − 1  M) to laccase suspensions showed a concomitant decrease in the laccase activity {{with the increase in}} salt concentrations; these authors also reported that the addition of Cu 2 + to the enzyme suspension resulted by a 25 % decrease in its activity. Kim and Nicell (2006 a) reported also that the laccase suspension, treated with 1  mM cyanide, Cu 2 + and Fe 3 +, showed a significant decrease in the conversion of triclosan by 55.8, 28.0 and 6.2 %, respectively; since this decrease {{may be due to the}} fact that these ions may interrupt the electron transport systems of the enzyme activity decreasing hence its activity. Modaressi et al. (2005) reported that the PEG- 3350 was able to increase (20 %) the laccase activity, with a turnover of fivefold toward triclosan. Kim and Nicell (2006 b) reported that PEG- 3350 had shown to be the most effective additive for the enhancement of the conversion of bisphenol A, by preventing the laccase inactivation rather than by increasing the reaction rate. Ghosh et al. (2008) suggested that the presence of PEG and glycerol in the laccase reaction solution may reduce the destabilizing effect of the products by hindering their hydrogen bonding site with the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> of those additives. It is also suggested that the presence of polyols in the laccase reaction media act as a water-structure maker which depresses the hydration of the enzyme and hence its denaturation (Papinutti et al. 2008). Although the metal ions including copper play crucial role as enhancers of laccase activity, especially that laccases have four copper atoms in their catalytic center, it could inhibit it at varying degrees, yet the destabilizing mechanism was not elucidated yet (Hernandez-Monjoraz et al.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Reversible {{addition}} fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) -mediated polymerization {{has emerged as}} a versatile method for preparing polymers with control over molecular weight and polydispersity. Inherent in its mechanism is the retention of the chain transfer agent, the RAFT agent, at the polymer chain ends. Typically RAFT agents are made up of two parts, the so called R (leaving) and Z (thiocarbonyl thio, stabilizing) groups. These are retained as the a-and the w-end groups of the final polymer, respectively. RAFT polymerization offers a ready method for preparing polymers with well defined end functionalities. The a-end functionality can easily be built into the R group. The Z group, however, is thermally unstable and can impart color and smell to the polymer. Hence, two new methods for Z end group removal were introduced. Both methods take advantage of the facile reaction between thiocarbonyl thio compounds and radicals. By matching the functionalities of the R group (a-end group) with that of the end modified w-chain end, both methods offer an easy route to accessing telechelic functional polymers. End functional polymers have many important uses in industry and in the biomedical field. An alcohol functional xanthate RAFT agent was synthesized and successfully used to conduct the RAFT-mediated polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP). Characterization by NMR and MALDI ToF MS confirmed that a-hydroxyl-w-xanthate-functional PVP was easily produced. In the first end group modification method radicals were generated as in atom transfer radical addition (ATRA). A hydroxyl functional a-haloester was used as the ATRA initiator with a Cu catalyst system. The alkyl radical produced by this ATRA initiator then replaced the Z group giving a telechelic hydroxyl functional polymer. NMR analysis showed that the thiocarbonyl thio end group was completely removed. The hydroxyl functionality was quantified by derivatizing with trichloro acetyl isocyanate and subsequent analysis by NMR. MALDI ToF MS analysis, however, was inconclusive. In the second method the thiocarbonyl thio end group was removed by simply heating the polymer with hydrogen peroxide, thereby replacing the Z group with a <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> at the w-chain end, giving a telechelic functional polymer. The telechelic hydroxyl functional polymer was subsequently crosslinked with a trifunctional isocyanate to make a PVP hydrogel. This confirmed that the end-modified polymer was indeed telechelic.

30|$|The {{selection}} of ILs for lignocellulosic biomass dissolution is difficult, {{due to the}} different {{physical and chemical properties}} that IL presents. It was referred that ILs constructed by bulky cation and halide anion may decrease the concentration of active chloride ion and thus the solvating capacity for both cellulose and lignin is reduced [19]. The comparison of the efficiency of [emim][Cl] and [bmim][Cl] in the dissolution of rice straw allows to notice that [emim] cation, as smaller sized than [bmim] cation, might be more effective due to its higher degree of interaction with the cellulose chain [33, 51]. A smaller anion is also preferable to be able to diffuse faster within the lignocellulosic matrix {{as in the case of}} chloride anion. Nevertheless, the improvements in lignocellulose dissolution are related with the hydrogen bond basicity of the IL anion as referred above. ILs with a strong hydrogen bond basicity are effective in weakening the hydrogen-bonding network of the polymer chains [40, 52]. As it was stated before the increased basicity of the [CH 3 COO] anion makes it more efficient at disrupting the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in biopolymers than Cl anion [25]. To predict the pre-treatment efficiency of a certain IL in disrupting lignocellulose, β Kamlet-Taft parameter is an useful tool as demonstrated by Brandt et al. for [bmim][CH 3 COO] and [bmim][Cl] [40]. As it was aforementioned, they confirmed better efficiency of [CH 3 COO] IL (β = 1.20) than the chloride IL (β = 0.83) in the dissolution of pine wood chips. Indeed, ILs with β[*]≥[*] 1.0 support high yields of fermentable sugars following pre-treatment [41]. As it is stated above, glycinate ionic liquid demonstrates high hydrogen basicity. The glycinate anion is characterised to have a weak electron withdrawing group (−NH 2) on β carbon, although this negative inductive effect does not influence the hydrogen bond formation by the carboxylate group (−COO-) with lignocellulosic biomass [42]. In the case of [emim][TFA] the strong electron withdrawing groups (−F-) decrease the electron density of COO-, thereby it reduces the formation of hydrogen bonds between biomass and IL during dissolution [42]. ILs with anions showing a low hydrogen bond basicity, such as [bmim][MeSO 4], [bmim][HSO 4], [bmim][MeSO 3] are unable to perform a complete dissolution of the biomass, since interaction with cellulose is weak [53]. Other examples are [bmim][OTf] and [bmim][N(CN) 2] which are incapable to break the hydrogen bonds in the matrix and therefore do not expand it at all or only minimally [40]. Generally, increased hydrogen bond basicity of the anion leads to the incorporation of water molecules in the IL structure [54], reducing the dissolution of biomass in IL. Therefore, drying of the IL prior to use is required regardless the biomass moisture. However, not only hydrogen basicity of IL is important, but also its structure affects the dissolution process. Muhammad et al. presented that the [Ch][PrOO] IL, in spite of a high hydrogen basicity, has a poor dissolution ability [42]. This behaviour was explained by the internal interaction between the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> of IL cation and its anion. Furthermore, the absence of aromatic ring in the cation structure had a negative effect on the dissolution unable to interact with lignin.|$|E

The fluorine level in the outer few nanometers is significantly greater than that in the bulk, as revealed by XPS studies. The driving force for the surface segregation of fluorinated species comes from the large difference in surface energy between the oligoesters and their fluorinated counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of Pluronic®F 108 {a triblock {{copolymer}} surfactant of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) [PEG-PPG-PEG]) were modified into primary amine, sulfonic acid, and quaternary ammonium equivalents {{for use in}} affinity chromatography. NMR was used for monitoring the efficacy of modifications on intermediaries and final products. The primary amine equivalents were prepared via conversion of the hydroxyl groups to a tosylate, its displacement with an azide, followed by reduction to the primary amine. The sulfonic acid equivalents were prepared via hydroxyl group tosylation, the displacement of tosylate with thiol, and its oxidation to sulfonic acid. The conversion to trimethyl ammonium was achieved via hydroxyl group tosylation, tosylate displacement by halide, and halide displacement with trimethylamine. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

50|$|Some {{researchers}} have been studying ways in which to protect certain oligomers or polymers from oxidation processes. One example is inserting an oligomer into a multiblock copolymer. An example is the TGA traces of both the oligomer and the oligomer/multiblock copolymer in N2 and in air. When the TGAs were run under a nitrogen atmosphere, there is no oxidation of the substrate. When the TGA of the oligomer was run under air, an oxidation process can be seen between 200 °C-350 °C. This process is not seen for the oligomer/multiblock copolymer. The authors of this paper explained this disappearance by suggesting that the oxidative process involved <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> on the oligomer. The encasing of the oligomer by the multiblock copolymer prevented this from happening.|$|R
40|$|Three {{isomeric}} poly(2 -octadecyl- 1, 3 -trimethylene phthalate) s {{were prepared}} by melt transesterification of the corresponding diphenyl ester and 2 -octadecyl- 1, 3 -propanediol. Intrinsic viscosity, {{size exclusion chromatography}} and light scattering determinations yielded weight-average molecular masses of 110 000 and higher. High-resolution, solution C- 13 n. m. r. spectroscopy analysis of both the diphenyl ester precursors and polyesters identified the main-chain units, the isomeric aromatic acid residue and glycol carbons, the linking and the terminal ends of the octadecyl side chain, and finally allowed detection of phenyl ester <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> at 1 - 2 % level. No absorption band due to <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> was monitored in the i. r. polyester spectra. I. r. spectroscopy, d. s. c. and powder X-ray diffractometry provided {{a clear indication of}} the crystallinity of the prepared polyesters. The relevant melting enthalpy values and X-ray diffraction patterns were typical of comb-shaped polymers in which the paraffinic side chains crystallize independently with their characteristic hexagonal packing...|$|R
40|$|Bis-boron-thexyl-silaboracycle was {{prepared}} by hydroboration of 1, 4 -bis(methyldivinylsilyl) butane with thexylborane {{and used to}} initiate the polyhomologation of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide to afford well-defined hydroxy-terminated 4 -arm polyethylene (PE) stars. The synthesized PE stars were transformed to (PE-b-PCL) 4 starblock copolymers via the ring-opening polymerization of ϵ-caprolactone (CL) initiated by the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of (PE-OH) 4 {{in the presence of}} P 2 -tBu phosphazene base. Esterification of the hydroxyl groups of the OH-terminated PE star with 2, 2 -dichloroacetyl chloride led to (PE-Cl 2) 4 which was used as initiator (eight initiating atom transfer radical polymerization, ATRP, sites) for the synthesis of (PE-b-PMMA 2) 4 dendrimer-like stars by the ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA).

40|$|Negatively charged hyperbranched polyether-based {{polyelectrolytes}} Abstract The {{preparation of}} car-boxylated hyperbranched polyglycer-ols of narrow polydispersity {{was achieved by}} modification (78 – 90 %) of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> via Michael addition of acrylonitrile, followed by hydrolysis. High conversion could only be achieved for low molecular weight starting materials (520 and 1, 030 g mol− 1). The solution proper-ties of the resulting materials were investigated by dynamic light scatter-ing (DLS), showing the formation of large aggregates with size depending on the pH value. After deposition on a negatively charged mica surface, the structures observed by atomic force microscope (AFM) show the coexis-tence of aggregates and single macromolecules. Most interesting, {{in the case of}} the lower molecular weight sample (PG 520 g mol− 1), extended and ordered terrace structures were formed, which are unprecedented for hyperbranched polymers and are of interest for surface modification in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} a [1]benzothieno[3, 2 -b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT) {{derivative}} decorated with hexyl chains functionalized with <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> is reported. A rapid and inexpensive functionalization of the BTBT in positions 2 and 7 has been developed. This compound is able to self-organize into a lamellar structure through σ-π stacking and van der Waals interactions but also through hydrogen bonding interactions. The hydrogen-bonded network controls the interlamellar region in terms of organization and stability. The liquid-crystal phase and structural changes observed by DSC have been characterized using an original approach combining FTIR and powder XRD measurements {{as a function of}} temperature. Thermally evaporated diol based OFETs exhibited good mobilities of up to 0. 17 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 measured under an inert atmosphere but also in ambient air. The diol derivative {{is considered to be a}} very promising platform for the design of new functionalized BTBT. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the relaxation dynamics of poly (oxybutylene), POB, chains of various lengths, with different <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> (OH and CH 3) in bulk and in confinement using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. It is known that POB chains exhibit, apart from the segmental (main) relaxation process, the dielectric normal mode process which reflects the global chain motions. The comparative study of OH- and methyl-ended POB chains in bulk reveals the marked effect of association of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> and indicates that the decrease in {{the density of the}} methylated specimens results in the acceleration of both relaxation processes, main and normal mode relaxations. For the confined POB chains the data indicate that the segmental relaxation process becomes faster (the effect being more pronounced for the methylated POB chains). A decrease in T-g of about 8 K for the methyl- and 2 K for OH-ended POB chains is estimated. Regarding the average relaxation rates of the normal mode process our data indicate that global chain mobility is not affected by the confinement. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|This work {{describes}} the synthesis {{and the study}} of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) PHEMA hydrogels, cross-linked by poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) chains containing the Gly-Gly-Leu tripeptide. This sequence was selected for its ability to be cleaved by subtilisin, a bacterial protease. The cross-linker was synthesized by coupling the peptide with two amino-terminated PEO chains of Mw= 3400 g/mol. The resulting polymer was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy, and was shown to be readily cleaved by subtilisin. Its esterification of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> into methacrylate afforded a macromonomer that was used as a degradable cross-linker and copolymerized with hydroxyethylmethacrylate to form hydrogels. The swelling ratio of the gels increases when the PEO cross-linker/polyHEMA ratio increases. Incubation of these gels with the enzyme led to the total degradation of the gels. These assays show that these gels can be used as drug-delivery systems where the release is triggered by the presence of proteases.|$|R
40|$|Blends of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) were {{prepared}} in a co-rotating twin screw miniextruder (40 rpm, 200 °). It was attempted to prepare multiblock copolymers by allowing a controlled number of transesterification reactions. Various cat-alysts (n-Bu 3 SnOMe, Sn(Oct) 2, Ti(OBu) 4, Y(Oct) 3, para-toluene sulphonic acid) {{were introduced to}} promote these transesterification reactions. However, PLLA degradation by ring-closing depolymerization was the dominant reaction in every case. Alternatively, after showing that L-lactide can be conveniently polymerized in the extruder, L-lactide and hy-droxyl functionalized prepolymers of PCL or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were fed to the extruder {{in the presence of}} stannous octoate. Monomer conversions of over 90 % and effective transformation of all <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> present were generally reached. Di-and triblock copolymers could be prepared in this way with characteristics very similar to polymers prepared in a batch-type process, but with considerably reduced reaction times in a fashion, which is, in principle, scaleable to a continuous process for the production of such block copolymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of phosphine or amine structural units into dendritic polymers offer significant potential in building macromolecular species with desired properties for heterogenizing homogeneous catalysis. To this end, synthetic methodologies {{based on the}} chemistry of acid-base hydrolysis of aminosilanes with molecules possessing <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> and that of phosphorus halides/amides with alkynyl/alcohol monomers were explored as approaches to construct phosphorus(III) - and nitrogen-containing dendritic polymers. Attempted implementation of a three-step, divergent synthetic methodology led {{to the discovery of}} two new phosphorus(III) -based compounds, P[O(CH 2) 2 C≡CH] 3 and P[O(CH 2) 2 C≡CSn(CH 3) 3] 3. Efforts to execute a two-step, divergent synthetic route to nitrogen-containing dendrimers afforded first- and second-generation dendrimers, N 4 and N 10. Attempts to adapt this methodology to one-pot procedures for hyperbranched polyamines show promise. Finally, single-step and pseudo-single-step procedures for synthesizing hyperbranched polyphosphines were employed in the preparation of several phosphorus(III) -containing macromolecules. These materials were successfully functionalized with Rh(I) organometallic complexes...|$|R
