40|$|Suomi-NPP VIIRS {{contains}} a visible imaging band designed to produce imagery both during daytime and nighttime called the Day-Night Band (DNB). The DNB {{is composed of}} a three gain stage backside illuminated Charged Coupled Device (CCD) with 4 light sensitive elements that aggregate the individual CCD pixels in 32 different aggregation modes across scan yielding imagery with a roughly constant Horizontal Sampling Interval (HSI). The highest gain stage is over 100, 000 times more sensitive than the lowest gain stage; {{the combination of the}} three gain stages allows for imagery to be obtained with radiances from 10 - 10 W/cm 2 /str to 10 - 2 W/cm 2 /str. The current DNB on-orbit calibration relies on a monthly special operation to determine the dark offset and transfer the lowest gain stage calibration to other gain stages. This calibration approach results in <b>discrete</b> <b>calibration</b> and the loss of some science data. In this study, we will present a new calibration method based solely on VIIRS calibration data. The calibrator data collected on the night side of the orbit are used to determine the dark offset and the data collected over the terminators and daytime orbit are used to compute the cross-stage gain ratios. This calibration method should be more accurate because the calibrator data is not affected by night glow contamination and is less affected by straylight. The calibration is also continuous as calibrator data are recorded for each scan. Because no special operation is required, this method can be operationally implemented to ensure continuous DNB calibration...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{undertaken to}} establish {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using high pressure common rail fuel injection systems with multiple injection capabilities. The areas covered are detailed as follows. Oscillations in the rail pressure due to the opening of the injector can affect the quantity of fuel injected in subsequent injection events. The source of these oscillations has been investigated. A method of damping or reducing the oscillations has been defined and was applied. This successfully reduced the level of unpredictability of the quantity of injected fuel in subsequent injection events. A relationship between needle lift, injection pressure and the quantity of fuel injected was established. The effects of fuel injection parameters (main injection timing, split main separation and ratio) and engine operating parameters (boost pressure and EGR level) on emissions formations and fuel economy have been investigated at five operating points. Design of Experiments techniques were applied to investigate the effect of variables on pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. The sensitivity and linearity of responses to parameter changes have been analysed to assess the extent to which linear extrapolations will describe changes in smoke number (FSN) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx); and which parameters are the least constricting when it comes to adjustments of parameter settings on the FSN-NOx map. Comparing results for split main and single injection strategies at the five operating conditions shows that split main injection can be exploited to reduce NOx or FSN values at all conditions and both NOx and FSN simultaneously at high load conditions. The influence of changing engine speed and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) on FSN and NOx emissions with given fixed values of parameter settings has been investigated. This established how much of the operating map could be covered by <b>discrete</b> <b>calibration</b> settings. Finally the variation in parameter settings required to maintain fixed FSN and NOx values across the operating map, near the optimum trade-off on the FSN-NOx map, was analysed. Combining the information gained from the individual investigations carried out highlighted some techniques that can be used to simplify the calibration task across the operating map, while also reducing the amount of experimental testing required.

40|$|In process {{analytical}} applications it is {{not always}} possible to keep the measurement conditions constant. However, fluctuations in external variables such as temperature can have a strong influence on measurement results. For example, nonlinear temperature effects on near-infrared (NIR) spectra may lead to a strongly biased prediction result from multivariate calibration models such as PLS. A new method, called Continuous Piecewise Direct Standardization (CPDS) has been developed for the correction of such external influences. It represents a generalization of the <b>discrete</b> PDS <b>calibration</b> transfer method and is able to adjust for continuous nonlinear influences such as the temperature effects on spectra. It was applied to shortwave NIR spectra of ethanol/water/ 2 -propanol mixtures measured at different temperatures in the range 30 - 70 degrees C. The method was able to remove, almost completely, the temperature effects on the spectra, and prediction of the mole fractions of the chemical components was close to the results obtained at constant temperatur...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} universal methodology for automated calibration of microscopic properties of modelled granular materials. The proposed calibrator {{can be applied}} for different experimental set-ups. Two optimization approaches: (1) a genetic algorithm and (2) DIRECT optimization, are used to identify discrete element method input model parameters, e. g., coefficients of sliding and rolling friction. The algorithms are used to minimize the objective function characterized by {{the discrepancy between the}} experimental macroscopic properties and the associated numerical results.

40|$|The {{research}} project {{is about the}} method validation for the determination of hexavalent chromium in seawater and other matrices by colorimetric method. This method is validated by referring to the APHA 3500 B- Cr Colorimetric Method. The current colorimetric method of determination of hexavalent chromium in wastewater is carried out by using UV-VIS Spectrocopy. This method is developed to determine the trace level of hexavalent chromium up to a minimum 0. 001 mg /L or 1 ppb of hexavalent chromium in seawater, river water and industrial effluent by using the <b>Discrete</b> Analyzer.

40|$|Development {{has been}} {{organized}} as a ÒpipelineÓ that links the separate disciplinary efforts of groups housed in seven institutions {{spread across the}} United States. The main research steps are: high resolution three-dimensional (3 D) imaging of the microstructure, statistical characterization of the microstructure, formulation of a probabilistic generator for creating virtual specimens that replicate the measured statistics, creation of a computational model for a virtual specimen that allows general representation of <b>discrete</b> damage events, <b>calibration</b> of the model using room and high temperature tests, simulation of failure, and model validation. Key new experiments include digital surface image correlation and ¼-m resolution 3 D computed tomography imaging of the microstructure and evolving damage, both executed at temperatures exceeding 1500 °C.

40|$|This {{graduation}} {{project is}} concerned with the response of embankment dams subjected to earthquake loading. The scope of the project was to determine the applicability of UBC 3 D-PLM constitutive model implemented in PLAXIS 2 D for prediction of the onset of liquefaction in embankments. The project consists of three <b>discrete</b> parts: a) <b>Calibration</b> and evaluation of the effect of critical parameters on the model performance of the model through simulation of laboratory tests; b) Simulation of dynamic centrifuge tests on sloping ground and c) the case history of the Upper San Fernando Dam. Through this process, correlations for the model parameters with measured SPT blowcounts were suggested and validated. The effects {{of the state of the}} soil, lateral earth pressure coefficient, the damping ratio and static shear were evaluated. And the model was validated in the case of controlled conditions like the ones in the centrifuge and in the field with the case study. In general it has been observed that the model has certain limitations especially when anisotropic initial loading conditions are encountered, but with proper calibration it can provide a good prediction of the pore pressure generation in the embankment.

Outdoor camera networks are becoming ubiquitous in critical urban areas of the largest cities around the world. Although current applications of camera networks are mostly tailored to video surveillance, recent research projects are exploiting their use to aid robotic systems in people-assisting tasks. Such systems require precise calibration of {{the internal and external}} parameters of the distributed camera network. Despite the fact that camera calibration has been an extensively studied topic, the development of practical methods for user-assisted calibration that minimize user intervention time and maximize precision still pose significant challenges. These camera systems have non-overlapping fields of view, are subject to environmental stress, and are likely to suffer frequent recalibration. In this paper, we propose the use of a 3 D map covering the area to support the calibration process and develop an automated method that allows quick and precise calibration of a large camera network. We present two cases of study of the proposed calibration method: one is the calibration of the Barcelona Robot Lab camera network, which also includes direct mappings (homographies) between image coordinates and world points in the ground plane (walking areas) to support person and robot detection and localization algorithms. The second case consist of improving the GPS positioning of geo-tagged images taken with a mobile device in the Facultat de Matemàtiques i Estadística (FME) patio at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

40|$|The {{increase}} of urban traffic congestion calls for studying alternative measures for mobility management, {{and one of}} these measures is carpooling. In theory, these systems could lead to great reductions {{in the use of}} private vehicles; however, in practice they have obtained limited success for two main reasons: the psychological barriers associated with riding with strangers and poor schedule flexibility. To overcome some of the limitations of the traditional schemes, we proposed studying a carpooling club model with two main new features: establishing a base trust level for carpoolers to find compatible matches for traditional groups {{and at the same time}} allowing to search for a ride in an alternative group when the pool member has a trip schedule different from the usual one. A web-based survey was developed for the Lisbon Metropolitan Region (Portugal), including a Stated Preference experiment, to test the concept and confirm previous knowledge on these systems' determinants. It was found through a binary logit <b>Discrete</b> Choice Model <b>calibration</b> that carpooling is still attached with lower income strata and that saving money is still an important reason for participating in it. The club itself does not show promise introducing more flexibility in these systems; however, it should provide a way for persons to interact and trust each other at least to the level of working colleagues.

40|$|We will {{describe}} a Virtual Test system for continuous fiber composites. The virtual test draws {{from a new}} wave of advanced experiments and theory that address physical, mathematical, and engineering aspects of material definition and failure prediction. The methods go far beyond currently standard tests and conventional FEM analysis to challenge our conception of what can constitute a practicable engineering approach. Emphasis will be given to high temperature ceramic matrix composites with textile reinforcement, which have been the subject material of the National Hypersonic Science Center, Materials and Structures, a joint AFOSR/NASA program. However, thematic topics also address generic fiber composites.
