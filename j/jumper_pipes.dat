40|$|Jumper {{connectors}} {{are used}} in the Hanford site for remotely connecting jumper pipe lines in the radioactive zones. The <b>jumper</b> <b>pipes</b> are used for transporting radioactive fluids and hazardous chemicals. This report evaluates the adequacy and the integrity of the 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -in. single-port integral seal block (ISB) jumper connector assemblies, as well as the three-way 2 -in. configuration. The evaluation considers limiting forces from the piping to the nozzle. A stress evaluation of the jumper components (hook, hook pin, operating screw, nozzle and nozzle flange, and block) under operational (pressure, thermal, dead weight, and axial torquing of the jumper) and seismic loading is addressed in the report...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site's (SRS) Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} {{development of}} tooling for remote replacement of gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors. The facility has compressed air supply, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and a lightweight robotic arm for {{operation of the}} remote tools. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) developed and tested multiple tools to perform the gasket replacement tasks. Separate pneumatic snap-ring removal tools that use the connector skirt as a reaction surface were developed for removal of the snap ring and spent gasket on both vertical and horizontal Hanford connectors. A pneumatic tool that clamps and centers on the <b>jumper</b> <b>pipe</b> ID was developed to simultaneously install the new gasket and snap ring. A pneumatic snap-ring-loading tool was developed that compresses the snap ring and places it in a groove in the installation tool. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. The entire system has been successfully tested using MSM's to manipulate the various tools. Deployment of the entire system is expected during FY 08. The Hanford connector gasket replacement tooling has been successfully tested using MSM's to manipulate the various tools. Nitric acid is used {{in many of the}} decontamination processes performed in the REDC, where the tooling will be deployed. Although most of the tool components were fabricated/purchased with nitric acid and radioactive service in mind, some of the prototype parts must be replaced with parts that are more compatible with nitric acid/radioactive service. Several modifications to the various tools are needed to facilitate maintenance and replacement of failed components. Development of installation tools for replacement of 1 -inch, 2 -inch and multi-hole gaskets is being considered. Deployment of the existing system in the DWPF REDC is expected during FY 08...|$|R
40|$|Subsea <b>jumpers</b> are steel <b>pipe</b> {{sections}} that connect hardware components on the seafloor (e. g. trees, manifolds, and sleds) and typically operate in multi-phase flow. They {{are designed with}} bends to accommodate limited expansion due to variations in temperature and pressure. Under certain conditions significant fluctuating forces can be induced in flow-turning elements like bends and tees. These fluctuating forces may cause severe piping vibrations and weld fatigue damage. This paper presents a flow-induced vibration screening procedure based on the 3 -D numerical simulation of unsteady internal multi-phase flow in subsea well jumpers, the prediction of associated flow-induced forces in flow-turning elements, and the prediction of structural response, including fatigue life estimates. We consider a 6 inch (nominal) diameter well jumper with six turning elements (i. e. six blind Tees), having 70 feet of suspended span, and perform simulations for two different flow conditions representative of early- and mid-life production. We find that the dominant frequencies of flow-induced vibration are those associated with modes 1 through 4 and that stresses are highest in mid-life flow conditions when the gas volumetric void fraction is 55 %.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of subsea developments in the oil and gas industry, {{there is a need for}} more, and reliable, information on how to conduct safe and well informed subsea operations. One of the hot topics today is displacement of hydrocarbons during shut-in situations and interventions. This is done by injecting a displacement liquid, typically MEG or methanol, to lower the content of hydrocarbons in the domain, aiming to prevent formation of hydrates or release of chemicals that pose a risk to the environment. This report presents results obtained from experimental work and numerical simulations conducted on a U-shaped subsea <b>jumper</b> like <b>pipe</b> setup, performed to analyze how the shape of the displacement front, flow pattern and phase hold up evolves with varying displacement velocity. To examine the accuracy of the numerical model and provide more details about the multiphase flow dynamics, experimental and simulated results were compared. A pipe geometry was designed and constructed to mimic a U-shaped subsea jumper, using 153. 6 mm inner diameter (ID) transparent PVC pipes. Displacement was done through two different inlets, located at the bottom left and top of the U. When displacing trough the bottom inlet, parts of the closest vertical section were blocked to mimic a dead-leg. In total eight experiments were conducted through each inlet, with water-oil displacement and oil-water displacement with four different velocities. Liquid hold-up was measured after displacing one, two and tree jumper volumes. A high-speed camera was used to capture the flow for further analysis. The experimental cases were recreated and simulated using ANSYS CFX, a computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) tool, to check the accuracy of the solver and models used. Two different multiphase models were tested, inhomogeneous mixture model and homogenous standard free-surface model. Shear Stress Transport model was used to model turbulence for both models. Results are reported numerically and visually before being compare to experimental results. Experimental results show that the displacement efficiency is dependent on the establishment of a displacement front. A clear displacement front was only observed for rates higher than 20 m 3 /h with water-oil and oil-water displacement. Water-oil displacement had the highest displacement efficiency, although it was severely reduced after one displacement volume. Oil-water displacement shows a better displacement efficiency after one displacement volume, but has a lower sweep efficiency due to a reduced front height. Overall the numerical simulations results has problems predicting displacement with low velocities, for oil-water and water-oil displacement. The inhomogeneous mixture model has a better prediction of hold-up for oil-water displacement when there is mixing of the liquids. The homogenous free-surface model predicts best for water-oil displacement, when there are clear interfaces between the liquids...|$|R
