Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes {{was one of the most}} highly {{anticipated}} prospects in baseball, but his major league career <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Federer and Nadal are {{one behind}} Djokovic, and within three of {{matching}} this feat of winning all 15. Nadal has also achieved a Career Grand Slam and a Career Golden Slam, but <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> fallen short {{of winning the}} tour finals, the Miami Open and Paris Masters. Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam, but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles, the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open. Djokovic, as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events, is a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters, as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally. Murray is {{two-thirds of the way}} to the goal having won 11 of the 15 events.|$|E

25|$|Ringette <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> been {{excluded}} from the Olympics {{partly due to the}} fact that it must have 25% of each gender to qualify.

25|$|Video gaming {{is still}} in its infancy {{throughout}} the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly.

25|$|While {{the book}} {{describes}} Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, {{in the words}} of one reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own Nokia, Samsung, or IBM. According to the book's authors, this is partly because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business <b>has</b> <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.|$|E
