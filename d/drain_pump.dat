The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool <b>drain</b> <b>pump</b> when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E

Since the engine room bilges could not be pumped, by the evening of 23 October, the first day at sea, the water in the engine room lower level bilge was over the deck plates (more than four feet). The crew tried to use a portable submersible pump, but were not successful.|$|E
5000|$|Ebb {{and flow}} systems come on {{according}} to the water-holding capacity of the medium in which the roots sit. Highly water-retentive media can require watering only once a day, while others require two {{to as many as}} six floodings, with each [...] "flood" [...] stage only lasting a few minutes. The time it takes to flood the roots is not a critical parameter, which means that pumps are often moderate in capacity and can be small for systems sustaining indoor plants. This makes the method popular with amateur and urban gardeners. Gravity acts as <b>drain</b> <b>pump,</b> and aeration is accomplished through thin-filming and positive displacement of air as it is forced out of the root zone by water.|$|E

30|$|In Fig.Â  1, the {{emulsified}} oil, which {{flows from}} the overflow pipe {{and then into the}} strainer through the filling valve, thereby filtering bulky mechanical impurities. The emulsified oil then flows into the vacuum separation chamber through the oil-taking control valve and the oil-taking solenoid valve. After the pressure is increased by the oil circulating pump, the emulsified oil is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases. After stabilizing temperature using the temperature controller, an oil mist cover is formed because of the positive pressure {{at the top of the}} vacuum chamber by the atomizer. This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum pump of oil during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor. When nitrogen is at the bottom of the vacuum separation chamber, the water vapor in oil is removed and expelled from the top. Under the oil <b>drain</b> <b>pump,</b> the pressure of oil after dehydration changes from negative to positive, and the oil {{flows from the}} oil discharge outlet through the check valve and the fine filter. After one or more circulations, clean oil is generated.|$|E

It {{is part of a}} {{combined}} sewer system of pipes, sumps, <b>drains,</b> <b>pumps,</b> and other infrastructure that transports sewage and stormwater run-off to the city's Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant. The East Side Big Pipe project, begun in 2006 and finished in 2011, was the largest of a 20-year series of projects designed to nearly eliminate combined sewer overflows (CSO)s into the Willamette River and the Columbia Slough. The combined projects were completed on time, and they reduced CSOs into the river by 94 percent and into the slough by more than 99 percent.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} combined vacuum consolidation and surcharge preloading which is arguably more sustainable approach to soft-soil ground improvement than other strategies in reducing post-construction settlements. Vacuum consolidation has become more prevalent with technological developments in vertical <b>drains,</b> <b>pumps</b> and geosynthetics. Satisfactory vacuum pressures can be sustained at greater depths and for longer periods than in the recent past. Soft soil deposits may experience different issues depending on whether vacuum or surcharge preloading is employed. Surcharging alone may lead to outward lateral deformations and shear failure whereas vacuum alone induces inward lateral deformations, producing crack formation along {{the boundaries of the}} treatment area. By balancing these two approaches, respective outward and inward ground movements can be minimised...|$|R

40|$|Check valves for {{checking}} reverse {{water flows}} in drainage systems sometimes make large impacts through their sudden closure caused by accidental cutoff of <b>drain</b> <b>pumps.</b> In order to characterize such phenomena {{and to find}} design criteria for impactless check valves, we observed the motion of a check valve and measured its impact acceleration and pressures in the drainage pipe, using a subscale drainage system. Two peaks of impact acceleration were observed; The first one seemed due to collision of the check valve and the valve seat, whereas the second one did due to water column separation and recombination caused by the low pressure during the closure state of the valve. The former can be reduced by adding mass to the check valve and by setting an appropriate valve-seat angle. The latter possibly can be reduced by relaxing the low pressure during the closure. Subsequently, the check valve opened through the water-column recombination impacts and sometimes showed opening-closing oscillation...|$|R
40|$|To {{facilitate}} crop growth {{excess water}} should be drained from the rooting zone to allow root {{development of the}} crop and from the soil surface to facilitate access to the field. Basically, there are three drainage methods from which the designer can select being; surface <b>drains,</b> <b>pumped</b> tube wells and horizontal pipe drains. The selection between these techniques is not very straightforward and depends to a certain extend on the preferences of the designer. Yet, guidance is given in this paper {{on the basis of}} a set of questions that are grouped in a flowchart. Although the flowchart suggests sharp choices between alternative drainage methods, in reality the choice between the recommended methods overlaps. Partly this is because the values in the selection criteria (questions) are indicative. Further overlap is caused by the construction and operation and maintenance cost of the drainage system under local conditions. These costs are not included in the flowchart...|$|R
