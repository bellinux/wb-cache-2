50|$|Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) phosphorylates several deoxyribo{{nucleoside}}s {{and their}} nucleoside analogues (a nucleoside with a sugar {{and a different}} nucleic acid base substitute or analogue that has unique properties when modified) using phosphate groups from ATP and UTP. More specifically, dCK adds the first phosphoryl group to preformed nucleosides and is usually the rate-limiting enzyme of the overall process of converting nucleosides to their <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> form, or nucleotide form, in the nucleoside salvage pathway. Below is a simplified pathway that displays dCK's role in synthesizing nucleotides using the nucleoside salvage pathway.|$|E
50|$|AGS is {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} disease resulting from mutations {{in any of}} seven genes encoding: a 3' repair exonuclease with preferential activity on single stranded DNA (TREX1); {{any of the three}} components of the ribonuclease H2 endonuclease complex acting on ribonucleotides in RNA:DNA hybrids (RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C); a SAM domain and HD domain containing protein which functions as a <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> triphosphohydrolase (SAMHD1); an enzyme catalysing the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (ADAR1); and the cytosolic double-stranded RNA receptor (MDA5, also known as IFIH1). Mutations in the gene OCLN on chromosome 5q13.2, which is thought to cause band-like calcification in the brain, have been discovered in affected individuals and categorized as BLCPMG which often associated with AGS. In most cases, except for IFIH1- and rare cases of TREX1- and ADAR1-related disease, these mutations follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (and thus the parents of an affected child face a 1 in 4 risk of having a further child similarly affected at every conception).|$|E
5000|$|Vpx enhances HIV-2 {{replication}} {{in humans}} by counteracting the host factor SAMHD1. [...] SAMHD1 is a host factor found in human myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, that restricts HIV-1 replication by depleting the cytoplasmic pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates needed for viral DNA production. [...] SAMHD1 does not, however, restrict HIV-2 replication in myeloid cells {{due to the}} presence of viral Vpx. Vpx counteracts restriction by inducing the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1. Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1 therefore decreases <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> hydrolysis, thereby increasing the availability of dNTPs for viral reverse transcription in the cytoplasm. It has been postulated that SAMHD1 degradation is required for HIV-2 replication because the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) is less active than the HIV-1 RT, which would be the reason for the absence of Vpx from HIV-1. Because Vpx is required for HIV-2 reverse transcription and {{the early stages of the}} viral life cycle, it is packaged into virions in significant amounts.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterized}} and purified an acidic dATP-binding protein, which, in its active form, {{resides in}} the nuclear fraction {{of a range of}} cells from mammals (including pig liver) and baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This protein exhibits a high degree of specificity for the deoxy form of the naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates and shows a marked preference for the purine <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> dATP and dGTP. The protein cleaves the terminal phosphate of dATP and appears to retain the dADP moiety of the nucleotide in a reaction that is resistant to both SDS and 8 M-urea. Fractionation of the nuclear preparation followed by non-denaturing PAGE and SDS/PAGE electrophoresis was sufficient to produce pure protein. The occurrence of this activity in all nuclei tested suggests that it {{plays an important role in}} nuclear metabolism. The specificity of the enzyme for <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> further suggests a role for this enzyme in DNA replication or repair, but the acidity of the protein argues against a direct interaction with DNA, and, indeed, the catalytic activity is not modulated by the inclusion of DNA in a variety of physical forms...|$|R

40|$|Removal of {{nucleoside}} {{chain terminator}} inhibitors mediated by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) using ATP as an acceptor molecule has been proposed as a novel mechanism of HIV resistance. Recombinant wild-type and mutant HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) RT enzymes with thymidine analog resistance mutations D 67 N, K 70 R, and T 215 Y were analyzed {{for their ability to}} remove eight nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP. The order for the rate of removal of the eight inhibitors by the mutant RT enzyme was zidovudine (AZT) > stavudine (d 4 T) ≫ zalcitabine (ddC) > abacavir > amdoxovir (DAPD) > lamivudine (3 TC) > didanosine (ddI) > tenofovir. Thymidine analogs AZT and d 4 T were the most significantly removed by the mutant enzyme, suggesting that removal of these inhibitors by the ATP-dependent removal mechanism contributes to the AZT and d 4 T resistance observed in patients with HIV expressing thymidine analog resistance mutations. ATP-dependent removal of tenofovir was 22 - to 35 -fold less efficient than removal of d 4 T and AZT, respectively. The addition of ATP and the next complementary <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> caused a reduction of ATP-mediated removal of d 4 T, ddC, and DAPD, while AZT and abacavir removal was unaffected. The reduction of d 4 T, ddC, and DAPD removal {{in the presence of the}} <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> could explain the minor changes in susceptibility to these drugs observed in conventional in vitro phenotypic assays using cells that have higher <b>deoxynucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> pools. The minimal removal of abacavir, ddC, DAPD, 3 TC, ddI, and tenofovir is consistent with the minor changes in susceptibility to these drugs observed for HIV mutants with thymidine analog resistance mutations...|$|E
