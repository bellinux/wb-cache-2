5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of <b>electric</b> <b>current,</b> potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics.

5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.

The fourth unit could be chosen to be <b>electric</b> <b>current,</b> voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field lines, which Io crosses, couple Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere by generating an <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> {{known as the}} Io flux tube. This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help {{to shed light on}} these processes. The Jovian {{magnetic field}} lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an <b>electric</b> <b>current,</b> which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath Io's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.|$|E

5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for <b>electric</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of <b>electric</b> <b>current.</b> The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
