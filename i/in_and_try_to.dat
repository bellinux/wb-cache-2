500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Falling Over Me" [...] was co-written by Lovato and Jon McLaughlin and {{produced}} by Fields. The song features a [...] "hypnotic" [...] bassline and lyrics about Lovato praying that her crush will notice her affection: [...] "I'm hoping, I'm waiting, I'm praying {{you are the}} one". According to Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times, Lovato's vocals in the song balance [...] "delicacy and force". On the fifth track, [...] "Quiet", Lovato longs for a [...] "communication breakthrough" [...] in an awkward relationship, complaining that [...] "It's too quiet in here". [...] "Catch Me" [...] is an acoustic ballad with a stripped-down production, written by Lovato herself. The song speaks of an unhealthy love connection, with Lovato going on even though she knows [...] "how badly this will hurt me". The seventh track, [...] "Every Time You Lie", is a song with jazz influences and a [...] "jaunty '70s vibe". Kerri Mason of Billboard commented that the song [...] "swings like Maroon 5's brand of radio soul". The song tells about self-respect and not putting up with lies in a relationship. [...] "Got Dynamite" [...] was written by Gary Clark, E. Kidd Bogart and Victoria Horn {{and produced}} by Clark. The song features [...] "ricocheting" [...] synthesizers and a scattering pop punk riff. The lyrics use [...] "violent metaphors" [...] as invitations for a boy to [...] "blow up" [...] Lovato's defenses, with lines such as [...] "Log <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hack me" [...] and [...] "Kick senseless, my defenses".|$|E
500|$|Consulting {{producer}} Gail Mutrux recommended {{feature film}} director Gary Fleder to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because she believed he would provide visually engaging direction without distracting {{from the story}} in the script. Other Homicide: Life on the Street producers were not familiar with Fleder. When Mutrux told them the name of one of his previous films, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Yoshimura became concerned Fleder was [...] "one of these indie kind of guys [...] going to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reinvent our show", a problem he had experienced with other directors in the past. After watching Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, however, Yoshimura believed Fleder would be perfect to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because he felt that Fleder could provide strong visuals to a story that took place in one location, and prevent the script from becoming too static and boring. Upon being offered the job, Fleder thought {{that it would be a}} challenge due to most of the action being confined to a single set, but accepted the director position based on the strength of Yoshimura's script:, [...] "The script was terrific. And for me, the big issue from day one was, 'How do I not screw it up?'" [...] Yoshimura said that feature directors often struggle with Homicide: Life on the Street because they are used to working at a slower and more deliberate pace than the typical eight-day filming period of a single episode. Additionally, Yoshimura said, they have little time to adjust to the regular cast and crew, which he described as a [...] "closed community [...] used to shooting or working a certain way on this show, and then have their rhythms and their patterns and their habits".|$|E

2500|$|In Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, {{there are}} several allusions {{to the meaning of}} life. At the end of the film, a {{character}} played by Michael Palin is handed an envelope containing [...] "the meaning of life", which he opens and reads out to the audience: [...] "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} northern Aché ritual was the club-fight. These events were organized by [...] "big men" [...] and took place once {{every year or}} two. Several bands would converge on a single camping area. Those who invited the others would prepare a cleared area in which to do ritual combat. Men prepared long hardwood clubs with sharpened edges (paddle-shaped), and decorated themselves with charcoal (mixed with honey and saliva) and vulture down. Although club fights consisted of hosting and invited teams of men, after the fighting began all men were free to choose opponents from either group. Men faced off and took turns swinging at each other's heads. Some men were hit directly {{on the top of}} the head and sustained fractured skulls, that later healed, but with tell-tale signs of combat. Other men dodged the clubs, but might be hit on the arms or shoulders. [...] Some men died in almost every large clubfighting event. Sometimes clubfighting would also emerge spontaneously within a small residential band, when one man was caught having sexual relations with another man's wife. These types of duels were never lethal. In all clubfights, some bystanders (including women) would rush <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hamper or disarm men who were in combat with their father, sons or brothers.|$|E

As Luis runs away, Chris confronts a critically wounded Gabe. Before Gabe can say anything, Marcus comes in, triggering a shootout between the two. Gabe is killed, and Marcus is shot in the head.

Meanwhile, Michael and Franco break into the government office and steal the information with little police disruption.

His mouth was stern, and his eyes too; and in the latter there was no glint of laughter. What he was about to say, what terrible castigation he was going to give me, I never knew; for at that moment a man, passing along the sidewalk, stopped and glanced in at us. He was a large man, poorly dressed, and on his back was a great load of rattan and bamboo stands, chairs, and screens. He looked at the house as if debating whether or not he should come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell some of his wares.|$|E

You see, my boy, what she says about Madame. Well, as I think I told her, that dear wife of mine may have had her foolish moments, like most others, if all the truth were known. But note this--there is a great difference between those who have foolish moments, of whatever sort, and those who make it their business to seek such moments; further, between those who repent of their errors and those who glory <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> continue them. If you have any doubt of that study the Bible, and read amongst others, of David, who lived to write the Psalms, and of Mary Magdalene, who became a saint. Also, although this did not occur to that tiger of a woman, I may have known of those moments, and even done my best to help my wife out of them, and been well rewarded"--here his kind old face beamed like the sun--"oh! yes, most gloriously rewarded. So a fig for the old witch and her tales of Madame! And now tell me the truth about yourself and Juliette, with a mind at ease, for Juliette has told it to me already, and I wish to compare the stories." ...|$|E
