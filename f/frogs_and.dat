5|$|In 2008, Gerobatrachus hottoni, a temnospondyl {{with many}} frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was {{discovered}} in Texas. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link, a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> salamanders are {{more closely related to}} each other (forming a clade called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians. However, others have suggested that Gerobatrachus hottoni was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.|$|E

5|$|Collegiate {{athletics}} {{have deep}} significance in Texas culture, especially football. The state has ten Division I-FBS schools, {{the most in}} the nation. Four of the state's universities, the Baylor Bears, Texas Longhorns, TCU Horned <b>Frogs,</b> <b>and</b> Texas Tech Red Raiders, compete in the Big 12 Conference. The Texas A Aggies left the Big 12 and joined the Southeastern Conference in 2012, which led the Big 12 to invite TCU to join; TCU was previously in the Mountain West Conference. The Houston Cougars and the SMU Mustangs compete in the American Athletic Conference. The Texas State Bobcats and the UT Arlington Mavericks compete in the Sun Belt Conference. Four of the state's schools claim at least one national championship in football: the Texas Longhorns, the Texas A Aggies, the TCU Horned <b>Frogs,</b> <b>and</b> the SMU Mustangs.|$|E

50|$|The two friends, <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> Toad, {{are portrayed}} {{by the author}} with human-like personalities and {{amphibian}} appearance. The situations in which they find themselves are a cross between the human and animal worlds.

5|$|Common toads {{winter in}} various {{holes in the}} ground, {{sometimes}} in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the common <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> green frogs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Bungarus species, who are {{primarily}} snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually feeds on fish, {{but it is}} also preys on other species of snakes, including members of its own species. This species also feeds on rodents, eels, <b>frogs,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally lizards.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E
50|$|Two {{books that}} contain {{references}} to <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> Toad were completed by Lobel's daughter Adrianne from uncolored material for three books. They are written, illustrated, and {{delivered in a}} manner different from the four <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> Toad books.|$|R

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|However, a Portia takes a {{relatively}} {{long time to}} see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> mantises, which a Portia often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> Toad All Year is an American {{picture book}} written and {{illustrated}} by Arnold Lobel, published by Harper & Row in 1976.

5|$|Leonardo also closely {{observed}} and recorded {{the effects of}} age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and <b>frogs,</b> <b>and</b> comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also {{made a number of}} studies of horses.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
5|$|Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods. The {{majority}} of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements. Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals {{of their own}} species, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, <b>frogs,</b> <b>and</b> small birds.|$|E

5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. The springs and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree <b>frogs,</b> <b>and</b> long-toed salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians {{appear to have}} arisen in the Permian. Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carboniferous, but {{the first member of}} Batrachia (<b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> salamanders, but not caecilians) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart <b>frogs,</b> <b>and</b> pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
