50|$|In this method, the gel {{is divided}} into two parts, resolving and {{stacking}} gel, both have different concentrations of polyacrylamide. The one with lower concentration is stacked on top of the one with higher concentration. Discontinuity is based on four parameters: gel structure, pH value of the buffer, ionic strength of the buffer, {{and the nature of the}} ions in the gel and electrode buffer. The electrode buffer contains glycine. Glycine has very low net charge at pH 6.8 of stacking gel, so it has low mobility. The proteins are separated according to the principle of <b>isotachophoresis</b> and form stacks in the order of mobility (stacking effect). Mobility depends on net charge, not on the size of the molecule. Proteins move towards anode slowly at constant speed till they reach limit of separation gel. Suddenly, frictional resistance increases but glycine is not affected and it passes the proteins and becomes highly charged in resolving zone. Proteins present in homogeneous buffer start to separate based on principles of zone electrophoresis. Now their mobility depends on size as well as charge. pH value rises to 9.5 and net charge increases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{separation}} chamber {{consists of a}} backplate and a front plate. The backplate usually consists of a cooled aluminum block, covered with a plastic covered glass mirror. The front plate is nowadays made of PMMA, in earlier times glass has been used. The distance between the front- and the backplate can be adjusted by spacers and is usually between 0.1 - 0.5 mm. The front plate also contains the inlets for the separation buffers and the sample, the outlets for the fractionation tubes and the platinum wires as electrodes. By applying different buffers over the multiple buffer inlets the operator is able to change pH, salt concentrations or composition and therefore the separation conditions over {{the width of the}} chamber. The separation buffers and the sample are applied by peristaltic pumps, to ensure a laminar flow. A high voltage electric field is applied perpendicular to the laminar flow. Analytes in the laminar flow can be separated by charge density and/or isoelectric point. Because of its highly versatile nature, this technique can make use of different modes of electrophoresis, like for example <b>isotachophoresis,</b> isoelectric focusing or (interval) zone electrophoresis. At the end of the separation cell, the separated sample is split up at the fractionation tubes and collected in microtiter plates. [...] Afterwards the samples can be characterized by all major techniques like HPLC, LC-MS, mass spectrometry (ESI / MALDI, depending on the protocol used) or electrophoresis (IEF / SDS PAGE, 2D-PAGE).|$|E

During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide {{an environment in which}} Kohlrausch's reactions determine the molar conductivity. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a thin zone of the order of 19 μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same migration speed by <b>isotachophoresis.</b> This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or [...] "stacking" [...] event.
