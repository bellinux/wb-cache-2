50|$|Some later {{switching}} systems used digit registers which doubled the allowable pulse rate to 20 pulses per second, and the <b>inter-digital</b> <b>pause</b> {{could be reduced}} as the switch selection {{did not have to}} be completed during the pause. These included some Crossbar systems, the later version (7A2) of the Rotary system, and the earlier 1970s stored program control exchanges.|$|E
50|$|The 2 out of 6 {{frequency}} {{code was}} used to pass digits forward between Registers in traditional International Switching Centres. Each digit took 55 ms with a 55 ms <b>Inter-digital</b> <b>pause</b> (IDP) and the sequence was sent 'en-bloc' to ensure that Echo Suppressors would not switch out the forward path as the links tended often to be satellite channels. The first digit was a keying Prefix (a KP) to indicate Terminal or Transit working and the last digit was the digit 15 or Keying Finish (KF).|$|E
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the exchange's central control unit design was its mode of operation, a processing of all calls on a one-call-at-a-time basis. This meant that call set-up had to be accomplished {{in a very short}} period of time. In particular, Call Control had to become free in less than the time of the <b>inter-digital</b> <b>pause</b> on calls incoming to the exchange. This time could be as low as 60 milliseconds. As the TXE2 call-set-up time was some 50 milliseconds, this design requirement was just met, but even so the overall capacity of the system was determined by the probability of an incoming call being delayed too long in its initialconnection to a register.|$|E
