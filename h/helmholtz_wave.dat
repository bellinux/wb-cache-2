Its radiation field could not be consistent with the <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>wave</b> equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an isotropic radiator with linear polarization.|$|E

40|$|Earth’s {{magnetopause}} {{separating the}} fast and often turbulent magnetosheath {{and the relatively}} stagnant magnetosphere provides various forms of free energy that generate low-frequency surface waves. The source mechanism of this energy includes current-driven kinetic physical processes such as magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause and flux transfer events drifting along the magnetopause, and velocity shear-driven (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability) or density/ pressure gradient-driven (Rayleigh-Taylor instability) magnetohydro-dynamics (MHD) instabilities.

The standard PWE is very suitable for marching-type numerical solutions. The one-way Fourier split-step parabolic equation algorithm (SSPE) is highly effective in modeling electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation above the Earth's irregular surface through inhomogeneous atmosphere [1 - 4]. The two drawbacks of the standard PWE are: (i) It handles only the forward-propagating waves, and cannot account for the backscattered ones. The forward waves are usually adequate for typical long-range propagation scenarios. However, the backward waves become significant in the presence of obstacles that redirect the incoming wave. Hence, this necessitates the accurate estimation of the multipath effects to model the tropospheric wave propagation over terrain. (ii) It is a narrow-angle approximation, which consequently restricts the accuracy to propagation angles up to 10 °- 15 ° from the paraxial direction. To handle propagation angles beyond these values, wide-angle propagators have been introduced [5 - 6]...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the asymptotic description of high-frequency waves in locally periodic media. A key issue is that the Bloch-dispersion curves vary with the local microstructure, giving rise to hidden singularities associated with band-gap edges and branch crossings. We describe an asymptotic approach for overcoming this difficulty, and take a first step by studying in detail the simplest case of 1 D <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>waves.</b> The method entails matching adiabatically propagating Bloch waves, captured by a multiple-scale Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, with complementary multiple-scale solutions spatially localised about dispersion singularities. Within the latter regions the Bloch wavenumber is nearly critical; this allows their homogenisation, following the method of high-frequency homogenisation (HFH), over a naturally arising scale intermediate between the periodicity (wavelength) and the macro-scale. Analogously to a classical turning-point analysis, we show that close to a spatial band-gap edge the solution is an Airy function, only that it is modulated on the short scale by a standing-wave Bloch eigenfunction. By carrying out the asymptotic matching between the WKB and HFH solutions we provide a detailed description of Bloch-wave reflection from a band gap. Finally, we implement the asymptotic theory for a layered medium and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical computations...|$|R

40|$|Recently, Huang and Carrington {{introduced}} a preconditioned inexact spectral transform (PIST) method for calculating energy levels and wave functions in quantum mechanics. Mathematically, the PIST method {{is a new}} iterative technique for solving eigenvalue problems. It gives both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions within a prescribed eigenvalue spectrum. The method requires storing {{only a small number}} of vectors but allows one to calculate eigenvalues and wavefunctions with far fewer matrix-vector products than the conventional Lanczos method used for solving eigenvalue problems. We present here a numerical solution of the scalar <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>wave</b> equation using the PIST technique in solving the associated eigenvalue problem. In this work, we first convert the scalar <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>wave</b> equation to an eigenvalue problem: we use the basis function expansion method, i. e. by expanding the unknown electrical field function in a complete set of orthogonal basis functions, the differential equation can be converted to a matrix eigenvalue equation. The propagation constants and mode field distributions can be obtained from the solution of the corresponding matrix eigenvalue problem. The method can handle any type of eigenvalue spectrum, in particular if the eigenvalue spectrum contains only one guided mode. Furthermore the algorithm can give distinct orthogonal eigenfunctions associated with degenerate propagation constants. We have written a user-friendly and modularized computer program. The program can handle arbitrary index profiles and geometrical shapes by merely changing the input files that describe the index profile. The method proves to be efficient, versatile, and requires less memory than popular finite difference and finite element methods.
