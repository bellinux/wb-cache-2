500|$|The {{club was}} {{excluded}} from a wartime league in 1939 {{and was also}} denied re-entry to the Scottish Football League Division Two {{at the end of}} World War II, along with six other small league clubs. As a result, the clubs competed in a newly created <b>Division</b> <b>C</b> along with the reserve teams of some of Scotland's top clubs. In the second season in <b>Division</b> <b>C,</b> East Stirlingshire won the league and was promoted back to Division Two, now renamed [...] "Division B", but finished last after one season in 1948–49, and failed re-election to compete for another year. At the same time, <b>Division</b> <b>C</b> was abolished and the club was forced leave the Scottish Football League to play in regional leagues for six years before rejoining Division Two in 1955–56 when the number of teams was expanded. The club sold many young players to larger clubs, including defender Eddie McCreadie to Chelsea in 1962 who earned 23 international caps for Scotland and is tenth in Chelsea's all-time appearance list with 410. The money earned from the transfer helped attract new players and in the 1962–63 season, the club won promotion to the top flight for a second time, as runners-up in Division Two behind St Johnstone. Like the previous occasion in 1932–33, East Stirlingshire spent one solitary season in the top tier before being relegated.|$|E
