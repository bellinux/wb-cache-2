OBJECTIVE: Students were to respond to open-ended items asking them to: 1. Reflect on the case and write down the ONE MOST interesting concept you learned after reading the case and applying the lecture material to this patient. 2. Reflect on the case and write down ONE QUESTION you still have about the topic that would help you to give this patient better care as a clinician (to be discussed in class as we “close the loop”). METHODS: Reflections were discussed in class the following day, collected and categorized into various areas of focus (e. g., social and patient-specific concerns, disease state management, pathogenesis and diagnosis, et cetera). RESULTS: Students’ reflections were read by faculty and categorized in the following major focus/learning areas: 1) pathogenesis and diagnoses; 2) disease state management; 3) social and patient-specific concerns; and, 4) medication-specific uses and information.

The simulator {{is used for the}} realistic modeling of a crisis situation and it is useful for both marine officers and emergency situation officials. The simulator will be used as an educational instrument enabling the interactive study of the different emergency situations. It has the aim of training students to efficiently react to emergency situations such as a leak from a ship/chemical plant, fire, poisonous gas emissions, or any other situations that could show a potential danger. The trainee must be provided with realistic information and the response of the model on the actions of the trainee must be in accordance with the real conditions and scientific based. It must be possible to accelerate the simulation speed without loss of information or functionalities. The input of the external weather conditions is a must, as well as the trainee-oriented graphic interface. It must be possible to change the chemical and physical properties and characteristics of the different polluting agents. The simulator is also used to evaluate the best strategies to be followed in an ongoing crisis. In order to fulfill this aim, the simulation must have the capability to receive data from various sensors, transducers and servers. The courses are designed to accommodate up to six course participants. Each course includes course material such as course manuals and other documents. The courses include hands-on experience with simulator operations and maintenance. To help the start up of the simulated emergency situations training at Constantza Maritime University, we have made a manual which includes some well-designed exercises with scenarios, initial conditions and relevant documentation.

Decision aids, which clearly improve patient treatment decisions but are new to decisions surrounding study participation, have strengths in precisely the areas where the informed consent literature is weak. Decision aids facilitate a process of decision-making, combining clear <b>documentation,</b> <b>exercises</b> to facilitate decision-making, and consultation.

Furthermore, decision aid research has clearly defined and operationalized three indicators of good quality decision-making in situations where there is no objectively correct answer: demonstrable knowledge of key aspects of the decision, accurate perceptions of the probabilities of various outcomes, and a match between preferred outcomes and the choice made. We identify outstanding issues and propose a research approach that will determine whether the use of decision aids can improve the informed consent process...|$|R
40|$|Background: quinine is {{a common}} {{treatment}} for nocturnal leg cramps but has potential side effects. An uncontrolled study suggested that calf-stretching exercises could prevent nocturnal leg cramps (night cramps) but these findings have never been confirmed. Aim: to assess the effect of calf-stretching exercises and cessation of quinine treatment for patients with night cramps taking quinine. Design of study: randomised controlled trial. Setting: twenty-eight general practices in southern England. Method: one hundred and ninety-one patients prescribed quinine for night cramps were randomised to one of four groups defined by two 'advice' factors: undertake exercises and stop quinine. After 6 weeks they were advised that they could take quinine and undertake the <b>exercises</b> freely. <b>Documentation</b> of cramp at 12 weeks was achieved in 181 (95 %) patients. Main outcome measures were: symptom burden score, and frequency of night cramps and quinine usage. Results: at 12 weeks {{there was no significant}} difference in number of cramps in the previous 4 weeks (exercise = 1. 95, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 3. 01 to 6. 90; quinine cessation = 3. 45, 95 % CI = - 1. 52 to 8. 41) nor symptom burden or severity of cramps. However, after 12 weeks 26. 5 % (95 % CI = 13. 3 % to 39. 7 %) more patients who had been advised to stop quinine treatment reported taking no quinine tablets in the previous week (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 32, 95 % CI = 1. 37 to 8. 06), whereas advice to do stretching exercises had no effect (OR = 0. 73, 95 % CI = 0. 27 to 1. 98).

40|$|Drawing upon {{a recent}} Council of Europe conference on markets and social {{solidarity}} and related interviews with financial industry elites on {{the prospects for}} pan-European pensions, this paper sets out the code words {{used to describe the}} 'new' Europe. After a century of enormous destruction and fragmentation, those now wishing to join Western Europe look towards the institutions of the European Union with hope and ambition. In doing so, the language of vision has become an essential reference point in understanding contested futures. In this context, elites are particularly self-conscious about their use of code words. These code words are especially relevant to issues such as the expanding geographical borders of Europe, the value and practice of democracy, and the apparent threat posed by Anglo-Saxon financial markets to continental nation-state social contracts. In large part, the paper is an <b>exercise</b> in <b>documentation</b> [...] identifying defining and explaining the contested status of selected code words I believe to be important in the European project. But the paper is also quite contentious, theoretically speaking. In order to explain the significance of these code words, the paper begins with the relationship between words and concepts in the context of arguments by Fodor and Jackson. Here, a way is threaded between those who see words as the essence of political ideas, and those who believe words are simply the reflection of a robust material world. Political concepts are disputed, especially their relationships to one another and their place in specific institutional and geographical settings. To do so requires explaining how and why my approach goes beyond Raymond Williams's Keywords.

In the context of economic crisis, almost all countries in the Region lack an adequate health workforce. Large amounts were invested by GPEI in human resources. This paper shows how the human resources funded by polio contributed to narrowing the gaps in health workforce and helped strengthening and supporting other priority health programmes in Angola, Chad, DRC, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Togo. MethodsThe health workforce strengthening methods used in the five different countries included the following: policy development and strategic planning, microplanning, capacity building {{of public health and}} community workers, implementation and services, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy and social mobilization, and programme review. ResultsStaff funded by polio helped with achieving good coverage in vitamin A and insecticide-treated mosquito nets (Angola, Chad); improvement of EPI and integrated disease surveillance indicators, improved quality of data (all five countries), administrative support, smooth introduction of new vaccines, increased case detection, and early isolation of patients suffering from the Guinea worm (Chad); reduction of cholera, extension of directly observed TB short course treatment (Democratic Republic of Congo); significant staff performance improvement (Nigeria).

O foco do estudo é o projeto arquitetônico de espaços que sejam produzidos a partir de sistemas construtivos que possam ser levados a vários sítios (processo de montagem/desmontagem/remontagem), de modo a identificar os tipos de espaços gerados e os processos utilizados em sua concepção/projetação. Busca-se {{investigar}} relações entre o projeto inicial concebido a partir de um sistema construtivo remontável (SCR) e sua aplicação na projetação arquitetônica por profissionais e estudantes, a fim de contribuir com elementos que auxiliem a compreender as especificidades desse tipo de atividade projetual. Para tanto foi desenvolvida uma pesquisa exploratória com base em multimétodos, que abrangeu: análise documental, visitas técnicas, entrevistas, questionários, exercício acadêmico e documentação por imagens. Embora o estudo realizado não seja conclusivo, os resultados obtidos indicam haver diferenças entre o ponto de vista dos projetistas do SCR e seus usuários (projetistas atuantes e em formação), pois os últimos demonstram ter alguma dificuldade para acessar os recursos disponibilizados pelo primeiro grupo, em especial os estudantes. Também se evidencia que o uso de SCRs parece alterar a valorização/hierarquização dos condicionantes projetuais, uma vez que, diferentemente do que acontece em projetos arquitetônicos tradicionais, os projetistas que os usam aparentam maior preocupação com as questões construtivas, sobretudo os elementos estruturais (apoios e cobertura), em detrimento de funcionalidade, estética e mesmo características físicas do localThe {{purpose of}} this research is to study the portable or reassemblable architectures, which, different from conventional architecture (whose designs are of permanent buildings), corresponds to the designing of spaces with temporary purposes. The focus of the study is the architectural design of spaces that are produced from building systems that can to be moved to different places (process of assembly / disassembly / reassembly) in order to identify the types of spaces generated and the processes used in their design / projecting. The aim is to investigate relationships between the initial project conceived based on a Reassemblable Construction System (RCS) and its application in the architectural design of professionals and students in order to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} specificities of this type of design activity.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{document}} and interpret a number of archaeological sites containing cart-ruts and other related features. Landscapes with cart-ruts are known to exist in Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, Italy, Greece, France, but mostly in the Maltese Islands. The study of cart-ruts is critical for the understanding of past human interaction with certain landscapes across Europe and especially to comprehend the varied causes that created these features and how these evolved across space (Europe) and time (ancient till present). Two sites were chosen, one in Malta and another one in Spain. The site at Misrah Ghar il-Kbir, Malta, known for its rich archaeological remains, covers an area of about 250. 000 square metres. The man-made interventions on the terrain indicate that the site constituted {{an important source of}} building stone, hence explaining, at least in part, the presence of such an elaborate and complex system of cart-ruts. Additionally, the site also supports a rich ecosystem of endemic flora and fauna. The terrain includes fields parcelled by rubble walls, vernacular structures and archaeological remains primarily cart-ruts, ancient quarries, tombs and cave dwellings. The site in Spain is located in the village of Padul near Granada. The project seeks to use state-of-the-art technology to document the cart-ruts and surrounding landscape found in the Maltese Islands and correlates the results with those collected from the Spanish site. This data will {{serve as the basis for}} the scientific study of these features which up to now have remained an enigma to distinguished authors who have tried to interpret them. So far, these attempts have been based on assumptions and limited scientific documentation and investigation. Unlike most sites which contain cart-ruts, the sites at Ghar il-Kbir, Malta and at Padul in Spain are still largely uncompromised by present development and may therefore shed new light and clearer evidence on the real use, function and date of the cart-ruts.

40|$|The Honeywell Experion Process Knowledge System (PKS) and Pilot Plant {{are both}} unique and {{invaluable}} teaching tools used in Instrumentation and Control Engineering at Murdoch University. The Pilot Plant {{is one of}} the most industry relevant practical components, which can be used to apply and develop theoretical control knowledge. Therefore it is essential to maintain and upgrade the Pilot Plant’s operability and performance. The main purpose of this thesis is to extensively analyse the current condition of the Pilot Plant, propose and organise an agenda to fix faulty components, install new components or new coding to ensure safer operations to protect users as well as equipment, and improve its working condition. To successfully achieve these goals, the project holder should have a moderate knowledge about the Pilot Plant server, Experion supervisory control system and the Pilot Plant’s C 300 controller. This knowledge is usually obtained from working and practicing on the Experion Teaching System, which is the first aim to start the project. As the Experion Training system was available for 3 months the work done to this system was limited. To improve some of the tutorial <b>exercises</b> and the <b>documentation</b> prepared by previous students, a simulated Experion system using a C 300 controller and a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) page for the controlled system was developed and properly documented. The simulated system can use Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC) to link to a LabVIEW program. This is a fundamental step providing another linkage between Experion and a MATLAB program through OPC in the future. The Pilot Plant Experion system has been extensively investigated in both hardware and software. By gaining an in-depth understanding of the system it was possible to identify the current problems regarding the plant and devise practical solutions for them. Numerous issues were resolved both physically and in the code. To prevent new issues from occurring, multiple interlocks have been designed, implemented and tested. Additionally the system’s code has also undergone restructuring, mainly in the form of removing redundant code. New sensors and actuators have also been installed and integrated into the system. Through the comprehensive research and development that was undertaken over the course of this thesis, it has become apparent that there is a vast range of projects and opportunities that can build upon this knowledge base and continue to improve the Murdoch University Pilot Plant and ultimately the Instrumentation and Control Engineering degree...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Strategic {{thinking}} {{is a popular}} research topic in management and business fields and mental models are studied extensively {{in the area of}} cognitive psychology. However, there is a dearth of research focused on mental models of strategic thinking. Limited empirical research and paucity in assessment or exploration of mental models of strategic thinking result in a theoretical gap that this study addresses. Although it is well noted in the strategic management theory that finding a competitive strategy is essential in achieving sustainable competitive advantage, few models include strategic thinking as a specific aspect in the strategy development process. Because strategic thinking relies on the mental models of strategic thinking, the cognitive aspects of strategic thinkers need to be investigated. This study specifically addresses the gap in investigating strategy development from a business and psychology perspective. Furthermore, limited research on strategy development in Australian local government and the newly-established regional councils in Queensland creates an opportunity to conduct a study focussing on organisational strategy in these councils to assist councils in achieving the aims of the local government reform. In this context, the aim of this dissertation study is to investigate the role of shared mental models of strategic thinking in the development of organisational strategy. This investigation of shared mental models includes the content of task mental models and group-functioning mental models of individual group members and also the content of the strategy groups‘ shared mental models of the task of strategic thinking and group-functioning. The levels of agreement of these mental models are investigated within specific strategy groups and among strategy groups on various organisational levels. Within the three Queensland regional councils which participated in the study, three levels of strategy groups are studied. The first level strategy group includes the mayors, councillors and chief executive officers. The second level strategy group includes the chief executive officers and directors of the council departments. The third level strategy group includes the directors of those departments or directorates that are responsible for developing corporate plans, plus other employees on operational levels involved in strategy development. Nine strategy groups are investigated—three on each level—and {{the results of the study}} are presented according to the level of strategy groups and not according to individual regional councils. Primarily, a qualitative approach is applied, although the survey section of the interview protocol includes a secondary quantitative approach. Multiple sources of data gathering are applied, including the interview protocol, a scenario <b>exercise</b> and <b>documentation.</b> Multiple data analysis methods are incorporated, including qualitative content analysis, scenarios, documentary analysis and Leximancer analysis. Triangulation is applied to compare the results obtained from the different methodologies, to seek for similarities and to integrate the different sets of results. The results of the study indicate that strategy group members applied strategic thinking in their involvement in developing organisational strategy. The content of their task mental models of strategic thinking includes the four elements of strategic thinking, namely to think about sustainable competitive advantage, thinking holistically, thinking creatively and analytically and thinking long-term about the future when they consider the long-term direction for their organisation. Medium to high levels of agreement about the task of strategic thinking occurs within and across strategy groups but this does not reflect identical mental models because individual characteristics influence individual mental models. High levels of agreement refer to similarity about strategic thinking although individual mental models ensure distinctiveness in thinking. Furthermore, the results indicate that although strategic thinking occurs in all three levels of strategy groups, employees on various levels contribute differently towards strategy development. A high degree of strategic {{thinking is}} required for first level strategy groups and this decrease progressively on the second and third level strategy group. Perceptions of strategy group members about the functioning of their strategy groups are investigated and the findings show that group members share perceptions about the roles and responsibilities of fellow group members and the knowledge and skills of fellow group members, but they do not share perceptions about how the groups interact. When the strategy groups were investigated, they were only recently established and in the initial stages of development. The results suggest that individual mental models develop in the initial phases of group development and that shared mental models only start to develop when groups mature. Regarding the levels of agreement within and among strategy groups about group-functioning mental models, the results indicate varied levels of agreement within strategy groups and overall medium levels of agreement across the groups. This study predominantly contributes to bridging the gap in the theory between strategic thinking literature and mental models literature by investigating mental models of strategic thinking. It also addresses strategy making within various organisational levels and develops a set of strategic thinking elements that include aspects of sustainability that do not feature prominently in current literature about strategic thinking. Finally, the study contributes to the development of methodology to investigate mental models of strategic thinking and the research methods was applied to real employees in real organisations, as opposed to studies in laboratory settings. The research methods can be applied in local government to assess strategic thinking as part of their internal analysis of competencies or in selection and assessment processes in the appointment of new staff. More specifically, this study contributes to learning and development of the regional councils that were investigated through the feedback provided to these councils about strategic thinking in their strategy groups. ...|$|R
