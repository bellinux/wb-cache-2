40|$|Main {{objective}} of this thesis is evaluation {{of the impact of}} <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> that enter Živný stream through the WWTP Prachatice onto the stream's fish population. Brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario) was selected as a sampling organism. Sampling was conducted in 2012 using an electrical aggregate at three locations. The sample counted a total of 36 fish. Subsequently there was conducted blood sample and tissue analysis using selected biomarkers (vitellogenin and EROD). Furthermore, an analysis of fish tissue and water samples was made to identify presence of selected <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances.</b> Concentration of vitellogenin in blood plasma of male fish in the controled location was zero, in polluted location the average concentration varied between 275 and 573 ng. ml- 1. Concentration of vitellogenin in blood plasma of female fish was the lowest at a location directly downstream the WWTP (7 185 823 ng. ml- 1). At other locations, the average concentration ranged between 9 250 302 - 11 614 177 ng. ml- 1. The activity of liver detoxifying enzymes (EROD) was the highest at polluted locations, between 63, 9 - 87, 4 pmol. mg- 1 protein. min- 1. In the controled location was the lowest activity EROD (5, 4 pmol. mg- 1 protein. min- 1). The result of identification of selected <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> in fish tissues (liver) and in the water is a sum of all detected pharmaceuticals. In fish tissues was the sum of all detected pharmaceuticals in the range from 20, 8 to 138, 8 ng. g- 1, while in water it varied between 0, 07 - 3, 00 ?g. l- 1. The highest values were again measured in polluted areas. The results of the analyses conducted imply, that the present concentrations of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> in Živný stream downstream from Prachatice have a negative impact onto live organisms...|$|R

40|$|Theme of the {{presented}} bachelor {{thesis is}} the study of the aggregation behavior of the humic acids (HA) in the environment of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances.</b> As <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances,</b> three cationic surfactants were selected (CTAB, TTAB and Septonex). In the experimental part of the thesis, the humic acids were characterized in detail using different methods (elemental analysis, ash content determination, titration acidity determination). The experimental part of the thesis is dealing with the structure of created HA-surfactant systems. These systems were characterized using the results of the elemental analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The key part of the experimental part of the study is represented by the selection of proper methods and by determination of the critical aggregation concentration of the humic acids in the surfactant environment. For these purposes, two key methods were selected in the frame of the presented bachelor thesis: isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. The first method is sensitive owing to the energetic fluctuations, {{in the case of the}} dynamic light scattering we are able to detect well the changes in the particle size caused by mutual interactions of particular substances in the system...|$|R

Particularly tobacco leaves from the lower part were highly contaminated with soil. Therefore, metals from the soil that were deposited on the leaves could contribute to the high level of metals in the processed tobacco.|$|R

40|$|The {{phagocytic}} {{activity of}} tunic {{cells of the}} colonial ascidian Aplidium yamazii was assessed by incubation of thin tunic slices including these cells with fluorescent microparticles. Only one type of tunic cell engulfed the microparticles. These phagocytic tunic cells are irregularly shaped, motile, and often contain phagosomes. Many of them also contain vesicles laden with round granules. Occasionally, they engulf another tunic cell. Because this type of tunic cell is always found in the tunic of histological sections prepared from whole (unsliced) colony specimens, these cells are probably distributed in the tunic under normal conditions. Peroxidase activity was demonstrated exclusively within granule-containing vesicles of some phagocytic tunic cells. This finding indicated that the phagocytic tunic cells might possess an oxygen-dependent microbicidal system. It is presumed that the phagocytic tunic cells migrate throughout the tunic matrix, engulf <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> (including bacteria) and also function as scavengers to keep the tunic free of discarded tunic cells and other debris, such as from wounds...|$|R

The decaffeinated beverages showed undesirable sensory attributes, especially those containing milk and other <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> and hence it was concluded that decaffeination is most desirable during raw material processing. Also a background study of the bacterial growth curve and its relation with caffeine degradation and N-Methyl Urea formation was done using Origin software and ways to ensure the release of non-toxic products were hypothesized. An alternate glyoxylate pathway was considered to avoid the release of toxic metabolites, which is possible by media starvation.

Acoustic emission monitoring followed the whole period of cure cycle, indicating in real time occurrence of adhesion and/or polymerisation phenomena. A wide database was so created with all the cases of concrete industrial interest, so to allow a statistical evaluation of AE data, leading to a reliable quality evaluation.

The NKR-P 1 A and NKR-P 1 B proteins belong to the lectin receptors of natural killer cells. Primary ligands of lectin receptors comprise terminal oligosaccharides of glycoproteins on the surface of target (e. g. tumor) cells. The interaction between carbohydrate structures on the surface of antigens and their binding partners on NK receptors is followed by triggering the effector function of NK cells against the targets. The NK cells and NK receptors findings and their interactions with ligands are greatly utilized in the treatment of cancer, viral and autoimmune diseases.

Poplar is poor of coloured extractive, so that the surface changes are attributed to the main wood constituents’ modifications and the contribution of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> to holocellulose and lignin can be considered negligible. The poplar wood samples were irradiated in a Solar Box chamber, equipped with a 280 nm UV filter, until reaching 504 hours.

The surface chemical modifications were evaluated by measuring the infrared spectra with a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) operating in DRIFT modality. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was also applied to study the surface wood changes by using a SisuCHEMA XL Workstation operating in the SWIR range (1000 - 2500 nm).

Another three samples were, processed Virginia whose origin was Billate, Shewa Robit, and Nyala sample. These processed samples, which were ready for use after warping, were prepared in the laboratory of the cigarette factory in exactly the same procedure of Nyala manufacturing by an expert of laboratory in the factory. Both types of samples were sealed in washed, rinsed with distilled-deionized water and dried polyethylene bag and transported to the laboratory where further sample pre-treatments were made. Drying at temperatures under 80  °C may not remove all combined water and may result in poor homogenization and incorrect analytical results. Drying temperatures above 80  °C may result in thermal decomposition and reduction in dry weight (Jones et al. 1991). Accordingly, after chopping the samples with plastic knife, all the samples were dried in the oven for 24  h at 80  °C. The dried samples were well ground by using pestle and mortar and kept in the desiccator until digestion (Nnorom et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic DNA {{analysis}} using {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) has become a valuable tool for rapid detection of biothreat agents. However, analysis is often challenging because of the limited size, quality, and purity of the biological target. Pre-PCR processing is an integrated concept in which the issues of analytical limit of detection and simplicity for automation are addressed in all steps leading up to PCR amplification [...] that is, sampling, sample treatment, and the chemical composition of PCR. The sampling method should maximize target uptake and minimize uptake of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> that could impair the analysis [...] so-called PCR inhibitors. In sample treatment, there is a trade-off between yield and purity, as extensive purification leads to DNA loss. A cornerstone of pre-PCR processing is to apply DNA polymerase-buffer systems that are tolerant to specific sample impurities, thereby lowering the need for expensive purification steps and maximizing DNA recovery. Improved awareness among Laboratory Response Networks (LRNs) regarding pre-PCR processing is important, as ineffective sample processing leads to increased cost and possibly false-negative or ambiguous results, hindering the decision-making process in a bioterrorism crisis. This article covers the nature and mechanisms of PCR-inhibitory substances relevant for agroterrorism and bioterrorism preparedness, methods for quality control of PCR reactions, and applications of pre-PCR processing to optimize and simplify the analysis of various biothreat agents.

40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an RNA {{virus in}} the family Paramyxoviridae, causes {{respiratory}} disease in humans. A closely related bovine RSV is responsible for a remarkably similar disease syndrome in young cattle. Severe RSV disease is characterized by bronchiolitis. The impact of RSV on human health is demonstrated annually when infants are {{admitted to the hospital}} in large numbers. Nearly every child will have been infected with RSV by the age of 3 years. While the disease is most severe in young infants and elderly people, it can re-infect adults causing mild upper respiratory tract disease throughout life. In addition, there is growing evidence that RSV infection may also predispose some children to the development of asthma. This is based on the observation that children who wheeze with RSV-induced bronchiolitis are more likely to develop into allergic asthmatics. Recent studies describe attempts to create an RSV induced asthma model in mice and other species; these have shown some degree of success. Such reports of case studies and animal models have suggested a wide range of factors possibly contributing to RSV induced asthma, these include timing of RSV infection with respect to allergen exposure, prior allergic sensitization, environmental conditions, exposure to endotoxin, and the genetic background of the person or animal.

The ideal instrument should enable the removal of all <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> from the root surfaces, without causing any iatrogenic effects. Aim: To compare the remaining calculus, loss of tooth substance, and roughness of root surface after root planing with Gracey curette, ultrasonic instrument (Slimline® insert FSI-SLI- 10 S), and DesmoClean® rotary bur. Materials and Methods: The efficiency of calculus removal, the amount of lost tooth substance, and root surface roughness resulting {{from the use of}} hand curette, ultrasonic instrument, and rotary bur on 36 extracted mandibular incisors were examined by SEM. We used three indices to measure the changes: Remaining calculus index (RCI), Loss of tooth substance index (LTSI), and Roughness loss of tooth substance index (RLTSI). Twelve samples were treated with each instrument. The time required for instrumentation was also noted. Statistical Analysis: Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons and the Mann-Whitney test for group-wise comparisons. Analysis was carried out with SPSS® software (version 13). Results and Conclusion: The RCI and LTSI showed nonsignificant differences between the three groups. RLTSI showed a significant difference between Slimline™ and hand curette as well as Slimline™ and Desmo-Clean™. Slimline™ showed the least mean scores for RCI, LTSI, and RLTSI.

Some technological parameters of extracts (density and concentration of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances)</b> have been determined. The most appropriate microbiological method of studying antimicrobial properties of extracts, diffusion method of “well”, has been applied; special mathematic method of comparison of antimicrobial properties of extracts vector analysis has been applied in order to study and to compare antimicrobial properties of extracts. Indexes of antimicrobial properties of extracts have been determined: a complex index of medicinal product antimicrobial activity for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial effect - A, and square of correlation coefficient - r², which demonstrates the spectrum of antimicrobial activity of the extracts (degree of similarity to the standard). The most active extracts have been selected; they have antimicrobial properties of medium strength: from the herb of chimaphila umbellata А= 2. 20; the fruits of rhamnus cathartica А= 2. 12; the root of rubia tinctorum А= 2. 11; the bark of frangula alnus А= 2. 05; the root of rumex confertus А= 2. 04; the leaf of pyrola rotundifolia А= 2. 00; and leaf of arctostaphylos uva-ursi А= 2. 08 (but extract from uva-ursi did not affected on 2 strains of microorganisms r²= 0. 64).

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} between alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Although the mechanisms behind AKD sizing and reactions with cellulose have been studied in-depth, methods describing AKD retention are poorly understood. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine the conditions and time-scale under which AKD and PCC heteroflocculate, and to determine the influence of PCC on non-retained AKD. We also wanted to understand the mechanisms behind AKD interactions with cPAM, and perform experiments on the twin-wire sheet former. We outline a procedure for creating an AKD emulsion coated by cationic starch and free of <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances.</b> We find that AKD and PCC each homoflocculate, but no heteroflocculation occurs between the two chemicals. This suggests that PCC and AKD do not directly interact. Instead, starch removal from the AKD particle surface aids the homoflocculation of PCC (via polymer bridging). This indicates that the alkaline environment is the most significant factor contributing to AKD hydrolysis. More importantly, we find that AKD and PCC are not likely to interact in the whitewater cycle. This refutes the general idea that PCC lowers AKD retention. Adsorption kinetic experiments revealed that although cationic AKD and cPAM do not flocculate, cPAM does increase the retention of AKD by assisting its deposition onto fibers. Asymmetrical polymer bridging explains both the increase in AKD retention and the behavior of AKD flocculation kinetics with cPAM. Although the initial kinetics are nearly independent of cPAM dosage, excess cPAM delays the achievement of maximum possible AKD retention due to starch and cPAM re-conformation. Lastly, {{it was found that the}} addition of cPAM results in an increase in the bond strength between AKD and fibers, thereby eliminating AKD detachment. Studies on the twin-wire sheet former found that cPAM increases the first-pass retention of AKD three-fold. The twin-wire former was proven to be a useful tool for studying AKD retention...|$|R

40|$|DNA evidence, linking {{perpetrators}} {{to crime}} scenes, {{is central to}} many legal proceedings. However, crime scene samples often contain <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> that may interfere with the PCR-based forensic analysis, resulting in partial or negative DNA profiles. Extensive DNA purification may remove inhibitors, but involves the risk of DNA loss. In this work, pre-PCR processing was applied to improve the success rate of forensic DNA analysis of “dirty” samples without interfering with {{the composition of the}} samples. An experimental model system was developed to screen for inhibitor-tolerant DNA polymerase-buffer systems. The best-performing polymerases, Bio-X-Act Short, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF, were applied in STR DNA analysis of PCRinhibitory crime scenes samples, i. e. samples that failed to produce complete DNA profiles in routine casework despite containing acceptable levels of DNA. A ranking index, called the forensic DNA profile index (FI), was developed to quantitatively describe DNA profile quality. The application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to FI values confirmed that the three alternative polymerases significantly improved DNA profile quality for 20 of 32 problematic samples, compared with the standard polymerase AmpliTaq Gold. ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF showed complementary inhibitor-relieving properties. A blend of the two polymerases exhibited tolerance to a broader range of extraneous compounds, improving DNA profile quality in 34 of 42 PCR-inhibitory forensic samples. When used separately, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF improved the results of analysis for 26 and 23 samples, respectively. Apart from their complementarity, synergy between the polymerases was mathematically proven by calculating the geometric mean values of FI and applying ANOVA. In November, 2010, the customised DNA polymerase blend was introduced in routine casework at the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science, increasing the proportion of complete DNA profiles generated from impure samples from 38 % to 87 % for saliva, and from 69 % to 94 % for blood. Many presumed saliva crime scene stains give negative DNA results if presumptive testing is not performed. In this work, amylase activity testing was evaluated as a tool for saliva screening. No direct correlation was found between amylase activity and the DNA content of saliva. However, the sensitivity of the developed swab screening procedure (positive results for 0. 5 μL of dried saliva) makes it applicable in cases where the number of DNA analyses is limited due to cost...|$|R

40|$|My Bachelor's thesis,,Nutrition of dialyzed patient" {{is divided}} into two parts, the {{theoretical}} and practical one. The theoretical one consists of eight chapters. The first chapter deals with kidney anatomy. I briefly describe the shape, size, position and vascular supply to kidneys. I also mention the basic functional unit - nephron, as well as primary and final urine creation which is connected with it. The second chapter is focused on three main kidney functions. The first one is excretory which means elimination of waste and <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances.</b> The second function is metabolic when kidneys participate in managing ions and water in the body and thus they keep homeostasis of internal environment. The third function is endocrine; {{in the course of this}} function, kidneys secrete renin, kallikrein, prostaglandins, and erythropoetin and they participate in vitamin D metabolism and degradation of insulin. In the third chapter I characterize kidney diseases and I try to reveal the main causes of their formation. I specifically deal with primary and secondary glomerulopathy, acute, sub-acute and chronic glomerulonephritis. The conclusion of this chapter is devoted to acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis; moreover I mention the most frequent hereditary kidney diseases. In the fourth chapter, I describe renal insufficiency and renal failure which {{is divided into}} acute and chronic. Acute renal failure is divided according to its main cause into pre-renal (functional), renal (impairment of renal parenchyma) and post-renal (urological). Chronic renal failure is divided according to KDOQI classification into five stages. The fifth chapter is devoted to metabolic effects (consequences) of renal diseases when the impairment of excretory, metabolic and endocrine renal function occurs (endocrine renal function influences all our body). I aim at acid-base disturbances, water and electrolyte metabolism, calcium-phosphate metabolism, hormonal function, metabolism of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and trace elements. In the sixth chapter, I illustrate the diversity of hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration and peritoneal dialysis. In the seventh chapter, I mention a kidney transplant, which is possible from a living donor or cadaver program. The eight chapter is the core of my Bachelor?s work. I deal with dietary and lifestyle changes in patients before a dialysis therapy, during dialysis therapy, and after a kidney transplant. For the practical part, I have chosen some methods of quantitative research. The purpose of the research part was to investigate awareness of dietary regime and how the respondents (patients in chronic dialysis programme in the Hospital in České Budějovice, a. s.) comply with it. I have stated the research question as follows,,How do dialysed patients comply with dietary regime?". I have applied a method of data gathering which was carried out by means of an anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 28 questions, out of which 12 questions are close and 16 are open. The starting point for the evaluation of results of following dialysis regime was questions number 6 to 27. Out of 22 questions, the respondent who follows the diet should have replied 12 and more questions correctly. The results based on a sample population have shown that 25 respondents on dialysis do not follow the dietary regime, while only 15 respondents do follow it. If the dialysis diet is not kept, not only the prognosis of treatment is negatively affected, but first of all medical condition of the patient is being aggravated. To address this problem, I recommend a consultation with a nutrition therapist who would thoroughly educate the patient, especially in terms of main principles in dialysis treatment. The therapist would also compile a diet individually for each patient based on their actual medical condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of modern industries {{has brought the}} regional integration of the correlated ones {{and the establishment of}} the mammoth cities resulting from the increase in the population engaging in those industries. In addition, such development in and around the established cities has exerted the significant influences not only on the economic but also on the environmental conditions of inhabitants in the cities and those outskirts. Among the substances constituting air pollution, coexistence of organic dusts and irritant gases such as sulfur dioxide gas should be recognized as an inducing fatter affecting health of the inhabitants in those areas. The increase in the respiratory disorder such as chronic bronchitis or asthma might be interpreted as the manifestation of the combined actions of predisposition, induced by organic dusts and others, and rising effets of irritant gases to the respiratory organs. The results obtained from the investigation reported here provide an clear evidence to the above mentioned interpretation. Guinea pigs in germfree and conventional conditions were used as the experimental animals. The former was evaluated as the essential tools for the investigations concerning the effects of air pollutants on living things in order to simplify the experimental conditions. Also, the quite unique way has been adapted to observe the interaction between sulfur dioxide gas and organic dust (skimmed cow milk powder), i. e. the silica particles were taken as an indicator of the phenomena of intaking and movement of physical extraneous particles into the epithelia and within the tissues, because silica impedes moderately the function of living tissues. The results obtained from the investigations were asbelow: Inhalation of the 40 ppm SO_ 2 gas induced the inflammation in the trachea of germfree and conventional animals. The inflammation in the trachea of the germfree animals was stronger than the conventional ones. None of the silica particle could be found in the trachea of the conventional guinea pigs after the inhalation of silica containing air. But when the silica particles were inhaled sequentially or simultaneously with the exposure of SO_ 2 gas, the particles were found in the tracheal epithelial cells and in the submucous layers. The emigration cell reactions in moderate degree could be found in the particle invased areas. The sensitization state of the animal with the organic dust was emphasized after an exposure to SO_ 2 gas. After getting sensitized, antigen-antibody reaction was induced in the respiratory organ of animals, when they encountered again the organic dust. The silica particles were found in the tracheal epithelial cells and in the submucous layer of the conventional guinea pig after the inhalation of 30 minutes with the mixture of skimmed milk powder and silica particles, when they had been sensitized with the combined inhalation of the milk powder and SO_ 2 gas two months before. There could not be observed in unsensitized animals such severe inflammatory cellular reactions in the trachea that found in sensitized ones. The particular phenomenon observed in the trachea of the germfree guinea pigs exposed to the silica particles was the invasion of the particles into the epithelial cells and submucous layers. The large amount of silica particles could also be found in the paratracheal lymphnode of the germfree animals after the silica inhalation of 30 minutes. There observed a decreasing tendency in the amount of silica particles invased in the epithelial cells as the frequency of silica inhalation chances were increasing. The intruding phenomenon of silica particles was also observed in new born guinea pigs except in those more than 24 hours after birth. The existence of silica particles, not in the intercellular space but in the epithelial cells, was ascertained by electron-microscopy and phasem-icroscopy carried out in parallel. The preventive functions of the tracheal epithelial cells against foreign particle invasion, including the removing functions of cilia, seemed to be increased by the so-called 2 ̆ 2 training effect 2 ̆ 2 of gases and dusts in inert degrees of respective concentrations. But the sulfur dioxide gas of 40 ppm impeded the preventive functions of the mucous membrane in conventional animals, involved in removing the <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> and checking the foreign particles intrude into the epithelia and subepithelial tissues...|$|R
40|$|Paramecia {{have been}} used as {{experimental}} animals in many fields of biology, including bacteriology and immunology. The use of protozoa to reveal protoplasmic response has many advantages, {{not the least of which}} is the ease with which they may be cultivated in large numbers and subjected to study. They react admirably to physical and chemical changes in their environment. They can be observed microscopically over varying periods of time, and long before death occurs changes within their substance can be noted. Furthermore, the fact that one may so adjust their environment that it plays little, if any, role in their activity makes it possible for the investigator to assume that any <b>extraneous,</b> added <b>substance</b> placed in that environment is the cause of the effect observed. And yet simple as these animalcules seem to be physiologically, Metalnikov (1926) has demonstrated that they may be "educated " to such an extent that they show an elective behavior toward insoluble substances, such as carmine particles, sulphur, and India ink. Despite the fact that bacteria, particularly the members of the subtilis group (Hargitt and Fray, 1917), are their main source of food, paramecia can be rendered bacteriologically sterile in a short time. Once this is accomplished, they can be used in the study of many problems encountered in phenomena of infectious disease. For example, the effect of serological systems, that is, the union of antigen with antibody within protoplasm may be observed (Rakieten, 1928). And, obviously, it is simple to determine the effect of bacterial metabolic products with which they are not ordinarily in contact (Philpott, 1930). Such studies might reveal not only hitherto unknown differences in bacterial derivatives, but also the nature of these agents which attack protoplasm simply because it is protoplasm, differentiating them from those other substances which exhibit an elective affinity for certain types of protoplasm. The fact that large numbers of a single species of paramecium were available as experimental animals, coupled with the idea that they might respond more delicately to the changes which accompany bacteriophage phenomena led to their use in this investigation...|$|R
40|$|This study, to {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} des(1 - 3) IGF-I in the maturation of IGF-I,used two strategies. The first was to detect the presence of enzymes in tissues, which would act on IGF-I to produce des(1 - 3) IGF-I, and the second was to detect the potential products of such enzymic activity, namely Gly-Pro-Glu(GPE), Gly-Pro(GP) and des(l- 3) IGF-I. No neutral tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP II), which would release the tripeptide GPE from IGF-I, was detected in brain, urine nor in red or white blood cells. The TPPlike activity which was detected, was attributed to a combined action of a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP N) and an aminopeptidase (AP A). A true TPP II was, however, detected in platelets. Two purified TPP II enzymes were investigated {{but they did not}} release GPE from IGF-I under a variety of conditions. Consequently, TPP II seemed unlikely to participate in the formation of des(1 - 3) IGF-I. In contrast, an acidic tripeptidyl peptidase activity (TPP I) was detected in brain and colostrum, the former with a pH optimum of 4. 5 and the latter 3. 8. It seems likely that such an enzyme would participate in the formation of des(1 - 3) IGF-I in these tissues in vitro, ie. that des(1 - 3) IGF-I may have been produced as an artifact in the isolation of IGF-I from brain and colostrum in acidic conditions. This contrasts with suggestions of an in vivo role for des(1 - 3) IGF-I, as reported by others. The activity of a dipeptidyl peptidase N (DPP N) from urine, which should release the dipeptide GP from IGF-I, was assessed under a variety of conditions and with a variety of additives and potential enzyme stimulants, but there was no release of GP. The DPP N also exhibited a transferase activity with synthetic substrates in the presence of dipeptides, at lower concentrations than previously reported for other acceptors or other proteolytic enzymes. In addition, a low concentration of a product,possibly the tetrapeptide Gly-Pro-Gly-Leu, was detected with the action of the enzyme on IGF-I {{in the presence of the}} dipeptide Gly-Leu. As part of attempts to detect tissue production of des(1 - 3) IGF-I, a monoclonal antibody (MAb), directed towards the GPE- end ofiGF-I was produced by immunisation with a 10 -mer covalently attached to a carrier protein. By the use of indirect ELISA and inhibitor studies, the MAb was shown to selectively recognise peptides with anNterminal GPE- sequence, and applied to the indirect detection of des(1 - 3) IGF-I. The concentration of GPE in brain, measured by mass spectrometry (MS), was low, and the concentration of total IGF-I (measured by ELISA with a commercial polyclonal antibody [P Ab]) was 40 times higher at 50 nmol/kg. This also, was not consistent with the action of a tripeptidyl peptidase in brain that converted all IGF-I to des(1 - 3) IGF-I plus GPE. Contrasting ELISA results, using the MAb prepared in this study, suggest an even higher concentration of intact IGF-I of 150 nmollkg. This would argue against the presence of any des(1 - 3) IGF-I in brain, but in turn, this indicates either the presence of other substances containing a GPE amino-terminus or other cross reacting epitope. Although the results of the specificity studies reported in Chapter 5 would make this latter possibility seem unlikely, it cannot be completely excluded. No GP was detected in brain by MS. No GPE was detected in colostrum by capillary electrophoresis (CE) but the interference from <b>extraneous</b> <b>substances</b> reduced the detectability of GPE by CE and this approach would require further, prior, purification and concentration steps. A molecule, with a migration time equal to that of the peptide GP, was detected in colostrum by CE, but the concentration (10 11 mo/L) was much higher than the IGF-I concentration measured by radio-immunoassay using a PAb (80 nmol/L) or using a Mab (300 - 400 nmolL). A DPP IV enzyme was detected in colostrum and this could account for the GP, derived from substrates other than IGF- 1. Based on the differential results of the two antibody assays, there was no indication of the presence of des(1 - 3) IGF-I in brain or colostrum. In the absence of any enzyme activity directed towards the amino terminus of IGF-I and the absence any potential products, IGF-I, therefore, does not appear to "mature" via des(1 - 3) IGF-I in the brain, nor in the neutral colostrum. In spite of these results which indicate the absence of an enzymic attack on IGF-I and the absence of the expected products in tissues, the possibility that the conversion of IGF-I may occur in neutral conditions in limited amounts, cannot be ruled out. It remains possible that in the extracellular environment of the membrane, a complex interaction of IGF-I, binding protein, aminopeptidase(s) and receptor, produces des(1 - 3) IGF-I as a transient product which is bound to the receptor and internalised...|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} {{worldwide}} health problems of {{an epidemic of}} obesity identified by the WHO in 1997 as a disease running parallel with other major diseases that are causing untold suffering both amongst the very young with childhood blood cancer leukaemia and an increasing epidemic amongst the elderly with Alzheimer's Dementia disease. The problem for many authorities is both cause and possible solutions. Most explanations as to why obesity occurs remain unsatisfactory. While medical science has improved the survival rates for childhood leukaemia cancer, it so far, has not provided sufficient explanation, as to why, {{the high incidence of}} child leukaemia continues to occur despite medical advances. The burden of Alzheimer's disease is also reaching epidemic proportions across the Western world as well as other countries, such that, the spiralling economic cost of care alone is now calculated in the billions, and which, if it continues may possibly cripple the, economy of some countries. The question remains, why, in this modern day and age with all the advances of science and understanding of medical science these three apparently disparate areas of human affliction continue to increase across many populations. Currently there are no plausible answers forthcoming for the proliferation of these diseases. In relation to obesity, many still regard it merely a matter of eating too much and exercising too little. For child leukaemia especially those born leukaemic, it is tenuous to correlate the disease with lifestyle factors. For those who develop Alzheimer’s Disease, lifestyle over a lifetime could certainly have a part to play, but what, when other individuals with similar lifestyles do not develop the disease? The simplest common factor explaining the onset of these three afflictions is diet. The question arises as to what kinds of dietary changes are now in place or what type of food changes are being invoked and consumed, in sufficient quantities, and that are perhaps markedly different from previous generations. The food supply of the majority of humans in the 21 st century contains large amounts of industrially processed products. These new, and abundant, dietary components may contain, and have, unexpected consequences and effects contributing to obesity, child leukaemia and Alzheimer's disease. The one foremost food ingredient besides sugar, that seems to dominate the food supply is soybean. Industrially processed soybean products are now ubiquitous in the food supply of many nations. Unlike traditional Asian soy derived foods, western style industrially processed soy products (soybean oil, soy flour, soy milk, soy lecithin, tofu and an extensive array of soy utilizing processed packaged foods), are not subject to fermentation. Fermentation reduces anti-nutrient and phytohormonal contents of soy although not completely. It is well recognized that modern soy products block absorption of essential minerals (e. g. iodine) and that they contain large amounts of (e. g. genistein). Although soy is promoted as a source of cheap protein, that is supposed to improve human diets, its anti-nutrient and xenoestrogen component content, may in actual fact, produce more detrimental effects for the human body, than the so far perceived and commercially promoted “benefits” derived from increased consumption of readily and cheaply available soy protein. The capacity of soy to not only lower iodine intake besides other essential minerals and nutrients, also, introduces into the human body, a number of <b>extraneous</b> estrogen like <b>substances</b> which may slow down metabolism sufficiently and promote female pattern of fat deposition. Hence, their hypothesized link to obesity in the first instance. Genistein is also known to be a topoisomerase type II poison, and could well be a contributing factor to interference of cellular development, causing DNA disruption and creating chromosomal aberrations in the rapidly developing embryo, during the vulnerable prenatal stages, especially, where the mother is ingesting soy products as part of her diet. And similarly therefore, the hypothesis linking soy to childhood leukaemia. Furthermore, genistein, despite some short term studies not only disrupts thyroid function, with its interaction with the hippocampus, pituitary and thyroid axis may also possibly be a slow, contributing factor, to the early stages of memory loss as well as impaired motor coordination as frequently observed in Alzheimer's symptoms. The meta-analysis of soy consumption and these three major diseases with prevalence across all countries for which WHO information is available, presented in this thesis, is the first in the literature tabulating an empirical result supporting the hypothesis that industrially processed soy products may contribute to the worldwide increase of overweight and obesity, childhood leukaemia and Alzheimer's disease. Of special interest are the results showing greater prevalence of obesity and poor, but heavily soybean exposed, Latin American countries than in wealthy, but using little soy, countries of the European Union. The results also show, that the two nations with the highest consumption of soy per capita, are also the two nations with the highest incidence of child leukaemia, and also the highest incidence of Alzheimer's disease (China and USA) besides their problems with an epidemic of obesity. These empirical findings indicate the need for the implementation of public health measures, to counter the increasing obesity and Alzheimer’s epidemics, the continued high incidence of childhood leukaemia despite improved medical survival rates. At policy level it may have to be decided to weigh up the economic-political benefits as opposed to the economic drain due to the escalating high cost and maintenance of medical care for all these diseases. On a broader scale, this thesis also argues that the food industry needs to be more thoroughly scrutinised to prevent its profit seeking business model and/or behaviour from creating worldwide public health problems.
