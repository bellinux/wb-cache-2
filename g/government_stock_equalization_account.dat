5000|$|The {{original}} expeditions that {{explored the}} regions that ultimately became Yellowstone National Park in 1872 caught fish {{in many of}} its waters to supply themselves with fresh provisions. It wasn't long after {{the creation of the}} park, that park officials understood the importance of angling to visitors and the importance of creating a ready resource to supply hotels and camps within the park with fresh fish. This resulted in the first <b>government</b> <b>stocking</b> of native and non-native species in 1889 and continued with a variety of successful and unsuccessful stocking efforts until 1955 when all stocking programs in the park were discontinued. Today's park trout are completely wild populations. Many of the park's waters held no fish prior to <b>government</b> <b>stocking</b> operations which introduced mainly non-native species to the rivers and lakes and redistributed native species. [...] In fact, {{with the exception of the}} upper Yellowstone River drainage, all the lakes and streams above major waterfalls were devoid of game fish prior to <b>government</b> <b>stocking</b> operations.|$|R

50|$|The Swaziland Stock Market is a {{small but}} {{thriving}} stock exchange. The stock exchange was established in July 1990 by Sibusiso Dlamini, a former World Bank executive who became Swaziland's prime minister, to enable ordinary Swazis to become stakeholders in their economy.

50|$|However {{interest}} rates are set by the market, and it happens frequently that they are insufficient to compensate for inflation: for example at times of high inflation during e.g. the oil crisis; and currently (2011) when real yields on many inflation-linked <b>government</b> <b>stocks</b> are negative.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to empirically examine the Reverse Causality hypothesis within the Nigerian context {{during the period}} 1980 – 2011. Employing Vector Error Correction Methodology (VECM), causality was found between inflation and <b>government</b> <b>stocks,</b> with causality running from <b>government</b> <b>stocks</b> to inflation, thus providing {{evidence in support of}} the reverse causality hypothesis. The results from the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) and impulse response functions tend to further lend credence to this finding. Accordingly, this study suggests, in part, the need for a tight monetary policy which would help to reduce inflation and stock prices, as such measures would leave the individuals with less money to buy stocks. Such efforts should be complemented by augmenting domestic production and encouraging investment through inexpensive bank finance...|$|R
50|$|In South Korea, refineries, {{specified}} distributors, and importers, {{are obliged}} to hold from 40 days to 60 days of their daily import, sale, or refined production, based on the previous 12 months.
