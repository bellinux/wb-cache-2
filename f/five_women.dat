5|$|Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte, Santa Anna's aide-de-camp, {{recorded}} the Texian fatality toll as 250 in his March 6 journal entry. He listed the survivors as <b>five</b> <b>women,</b> one Mexican soldier and one slave. Almonte did not record names, and his count was {{based solely on}} who was there during the final assault. Santa Anna reported to Mexico's Secretary of War Tornel that Texian fatalities exceeded 600. Historians Jack Jackson and John Wheat attributed that high figure to Santa Anna's playing to his political base.|$|E

5|$|Although the USCG officially {{opened its}} doors to African-American women in October 1944, {{it was not until}} March 1945 that the first <b>five</b> <b>women</b> were {{accepted}}; they were the only African-American women to serve in the SPARS. Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted African-American women from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) only began accepting African-American women in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving in the WAVES, and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to African-American women. The five African-American women who served in the SPARS were: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke.|$|E

5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. <b>Five</b> <b>women</b> served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
5|$|The current {{champion}} is Princesa Sugehit, who defeated Zeuxis on February 25, 2017 {{to win the}} championship. It is {{her first}} reign with the title, she is the 20th champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 29th documented champion overall. Martha Villalobos holds {{the record for the}} longest verified individual reign with 1,399 days while Lady Apache's two reigns combine for 1,470 days the longest verified reign of any champion. Due to the undocumented periods prior to 1986 it is possible that someone else has actually held the championship longer, but no verification of such a fact has been found. Isabel Romero has held the title three times, the most for any champion, while <b>five</b> <b>women</b> have held the championship twice since it was officially sanctioned in 1986; Lady Apache, La Sirenita, Tiffany, Martha Villalobos and Zuleyma. La Diabólica holds the record for the shortest documented title reign, with 50 days.|$|E

Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the <b>five</b> <b>women</b> standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity.

5|$|While the <b>five</b> <b>women</b> {{worked on}} ENIAC, they {{developed}} subroutines, nesting, and other fundamental programming techniques, and arguably invented {{the discipline of}} programming digital computers. Bartik's programming partner on the ENIAC was Betty Holberton. Together, they created the master program for the ENIAC and led the ballistics programming group. The team also learned to physically modify the machine, moving switches and rerouting cables, in order to program it. In addition to performing the original ballistic trajectories they were hired to compute, they soon became operators on the Los Alamos nuclear calculations, and generally expanded the programming repertoire of the machine. Bartik was chosen along with Betty Holberton to write a program to display trajectory simulations for the first public demonstration of the ENIAC.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie Curie won it twice), and 27 organizations. Sixteen women {{have won the}} Nobel Peace Prize, {{fourteen}} have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, twelve have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, four have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, two have won the Nobel Prize in Physics and one, Elinor Ostrom, has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. Curie is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when <b>five</b> <b>women</b> became laureates.

5|$|Southern Rhodesia did {{not appear}} at the Olympics again until 1960, {{although}} Rhodesian athletes {{had the option of}} competing internationally for South Africa. Leonard Hall, for example, won a gold medal in the welterweight division of the 1930 British Empire Games under the South African banner. By the time of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Southern Rhodesia was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (which included what is now Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) that entered the Games under the banner of Rhodesia. Fourteen athletes — nine men and <b>five</b> <b>women</b> — took part in six sports: track and field, boxing, diving, sailing, shooting, and swimming. Competing in the Flying Dutchman class, sailors Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result under that name. After the Federation dissolved in 1963, Nyasaland became Malawi, while Northern and Southern Rhodesia began competing separately. The North entered the Games as Northern Rhodesia, but left under the flag of Zambia, while the South remained Southern Rhodesia. It sent 25 men (including its field hockey squad) and four women; both the field hockey team and the Flying Dutchman crew finished 11th, while no individual athlete placed better than 17th.|$|E
