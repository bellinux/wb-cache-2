5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that {{incorporates}} contrasting musical <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music <b>elements,</b> <b>and</b> Laswell's densely layered production.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy metals are mainly f-block <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> the more reactive of the d-block elements. They {{have a strong}} affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy metals are mainly the less reactive d-block <b>elements,</b> <b>and</b> period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E
40|$|Buchi's theorem, in {{establishing}} the equivalence between languages definable in S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> < and the omega-regular languages also demonstrated that S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> < is no more expressive than its existential fragment. It is also {{easy to see that}} S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> < is equi-expressive with S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> successor. However, it is not immediately obvious whether it is possible to adapt Buchi's argument to establish equivalence between expressivity in S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> successor and its existential fragment. In this paper we show that it is not: the existential fragment of S 1 S over <b>element</b> <b>and</b> successor is strictly less expressive, and is in fact equivalent to the co-Buchi languages...|$|R
