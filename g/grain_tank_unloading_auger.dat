In {{some cases the}} combine has to leave the {{processed}} strip and to unload in a vehicle located outside the field. The publication analyses the reasons for <b>unloading</b> <b>grain</b> <b>tanks</b> by leaving the processed strip {{and the impact of}} this type of unloading on the combine productivity compared to <b>unloading</b> the <b>grain</b> <b>tank</b> in the field itself. A study has been performed in Bulgarian farms using different ways of unloading and the results of time measured for <b>unloading</b> <b>grain</b> <b>tanks</b> in {{and at the end of}} the field have been given when harvesting various agricultural crops. The combine productivity when unloading in the field and at the edge of the field has been compared.

40|$|Emerging identity-preserved grain markets {{depend on}} {{avoidance}} of commingling grain at harvest. Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} <b>grain</b> <b>tank</b> and rock trap. Intermediate amounts were found in the head or feederhouse, elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the cleaning shoe and straw walkers (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, <b>grain</b> <b>tank,</b> threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|R

40|$|Metal <b>grain</b> <b>tanks,</b> as {{constructed}} in Swaziland, were demonstrated {{to be extremely}} effective structures for fumigation on a small scale; phosphine gas concentrations were maintained well above the recommended minimum concentration of 150 p. p. m. throughout the minimum seven days exposure period. Current methods of sealing the tanks were shown to be inadequate but were improved by sealing the tank inlet and outlet using plastic sheeting and adhesive tape. Application rates of 3 · 33 g of phosphine per tonne of grain (as currently recommended in Swaziland) were more than adequate, provided the tanks were well sealed. "Tiny Bags" (produced by Degesch GmbH) were slightly slower in releasing phosphine when compared to conventional tablet formulations. However, the pattern of gas release and subsequent decay in concentrations were similar for "Tiny Bags" and tablets. As {{a result of the}} high degree of gas tightness which can be achieved using metal <b>grain</b> <b>tanks,</b> the recommended application rates for phosphine could be reduced. A system was devised for applying carbon dioxide {{to the base of the}} <b>grain</b> <b>tanks</b> using a probe inserted through the top of the tank. High initial gas concentrations were achieved but these fell quickly, necessitating frequent regassing of the tanks in order to maintain gas concentrations for the required 10 day exposure period.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The project goal is {{to develop}} a machine that can unload nuclear sphere fuel pebbles in a {{controlled}} sequence. The unloading machine will be operational in an environment filled with graphite dust and the gas medium is helium. Furthermore, the environment is radioactive and therefore maintenance activities must be reduced to a minimum. The unloading machine must fit {{in the bottom of a}} fuel storage tank. Access to the tank is only from the top, so as to control radioactive releases. The unloading machine must additionally be capable of unloading usable spheres and separate pieces of spheres to the bottom of the tank. A scale model was built to confirm the functionality of two unloading principles, gravity unloading and suction unloading. The gravity unloading concept was selected and further developed. Different improvements were made to the original concept used for the scale model. At first sequencing was not achieved, and therefore the concept was improved to separate spheres mechanically. This caused a possibility to damage spheres. The concept was further improved to remove the disadvantage of sphere damage. Spheres were now again unloaded through the centre of rotation of the unloading head. This mechanism achieved sphere separation, but not sequencing control. Another unloading level was added to the unloading head which proved theoretically to improve sequencing. At this stage of the design it proved theoretically possible to achieve sequentially controlled unloading of spheres, with separation of pieces of spheres to the bottom of the tank. The tests proved that the concept would work, but another improvement was required to prevent strung unloading of spheres. The <b>tank</b> <b>unloading</b> machine was not further tested with the required improvement. Therefore the tests should be repeated when the improvement has been incorporated. It is proposed to add bumps in the housing at the level of the second level of the unloading head. These bumps will prevent spheres from rolling towards the exit in the head. The spheres will then maintain their position in the second unloading level until the exit hole will pass the sphere to take it in. The conclusion is that the concept will probably be acceptable when the latest test was performed. It is however believed that this last improvement will be successful. The <b>tank</b> <b>unloading</b> machine is developed to be low on maintenance. It is believed that the bearings will not need replacement, thus no maintenance is foreseen. The <b>tank</b> <b>unloading</b> device can separate pieces of spheres before the usable spheres are delivered into the sphere transportation pipe. Master...|$|R

The harvest of soybean cv.

Today, machine manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s focus has shifted to optimizing {{the performance of a}} complete field operation through coordinated machine operations. The focus of this project was on the harvest operation, where resource usage is typically the highest. With modern grain harvest systems, combine operators often unload grain while continuing to harvest crop (unloading-on-the-go). In order to achieve this, the combine operator must coordinate machine speed and placement with the grain cart operator for accurate placement of grain into the cart. The combine operator manages on/off control of the <b>unloading</b> <b>auger</b> with in-cab controls as the well as the placement of the grain by changing the speed of the combine relative to the cart. This project developed an autonomous machine positioning system that controlled the relative position of a combine to a grain cart during unloading-on-the-go.
