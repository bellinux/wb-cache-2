40|$|Patients with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) not only respond to obsessions with perseverative checking, but also engage in more <b>general</b> <b>checking,</b> irrespective of their obsessive concerns. This study investigated whether <b>general</b> <b>checking</b> is specific to OCD and exacerbated when only mild uncertainty is induced. Thirty-one patients with OCD, 26 anxiety- and 31 healthy controls performed a visual search task with eye-tracking and indicated in 50 search displays whether a target was "present" or "absent". Target-present trials were unambiguous, whereas target-absent trials induced mild uncertainty, because participants {{had to rely}} on not overlooking the target. Checking behavior was measured by assessing search time and the number of fixations, measured with an eye-tracker. Results showed that in both target-present and target-absent trials patients with OCD searched longer and made more fixations than healthy and anxiety controls. However, the difference in checking behavior between patients with OCD and the control groups was larger in target-absent trials (where mild uncertainty was induced). Anxiety and healthy controls did not differ in checking behavior. Thus, mild uncertainty appears to specifically promote checking in patients with OCD, which has implications for treatment...|$|R

Using a universal kernel, we extend this result for any continuous stationary strategy. In this learning process, a trader rationally chooses his gambles using predictions made by a randomized well-calibrated algorithm. Our strategy is based on Dawid’s notion of calibration with more <b>general</b> <b>checking</b> rules and on some modification of Kakade and Foster’s randomized rounding algorithm for computing the well-calibrated forecasts. We combine the method of randomized calibration with Vovk’s method of defensive forecasting in RKHS. Unlike the statistical theory, no stochastic as-sumptions are made about the stock prices. Our empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that this type of technical trading can “beat the market ” if trans-action costs are ignored...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} modelling and reasoning about data-centric business processes and present a form of <b>general</b> model <b>checking.</b> Our technique extends existing approaches, which explore systems only from concrete initial states. Specifically, we model business processes in terms of smaller fragments, whose possible interactions are constrained by first-order logic formulae. In turn, process fragments are connected graphs annotated with instructions to modify data. Correctness properties concerning the evolution of data with respect to processes can be stated in a first-order branching-time logic over built-in theories, such as linear integer arithmetic, records and arrays. Solving <b>general</b> model <b>checking</b> problems over this logic is considerably harder than model checking when a concrete initial state is given. To this end, we present a tableau procedure that reduces these model checking problems to first-order logic over arithmetic. The resulting proof obligations are passed on to appropriate “off-the-shelf ” theorem provers. We also detail our modelling approach, describe the reasoning components and report on first experiments. ...|$|R
