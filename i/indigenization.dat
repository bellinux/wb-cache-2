5|$|The class {{incorporates}} {{some major}} features including {{but not limited}} to the 'X'-shaped hull form to improve stealth, a raft-mounted propulsion system to reduce vibration, and an infrared signature suppression system. It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that enables them to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the <b>indigenization</b> achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E
25|$|Further {{adaptation}} and <b>indigenization</b> would {{occur in the}} different towns and regions. Thus Malabon, a fishing town in Metro Manila, has developed the pansit Malabon, which features oyster, shrimp and squid. While in Lucban, Quezon, which is deeply inland and far from the sea has pansit Lucban or pansit habhab, which is prepared with some meat and vegetables.|$|E
25|$|The term is used, most prominently, for the Soviet <b>indigenization</b> {{policy of}} the 1920s (korenizatsiya, {{literally}} ‘putting down roots’), aimed at strengthening Soviet power in the territory of Soviet Ukraine and southern regions of the Russian SFSR. In various forms the Ukrainization policies were also carried in several different periods of the twentieth-century history of Ukraine, although with somewhat different goals and in different historical contexts.|$|E
25|$|A {{process of}} <b>indigenization</b> has occurred, and the Pathan are now indistinguishable from {{neighbouring}} Muslim communities. They now speak Hindustani {{as well as}} various dialects such as Khari boli. They are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, with settlements in Moradabad, Farrukhabad, Hathras, Shahjahanpur, Malihabad, Mirzapur and Rohilkhand being the densest. A cluster of Pathan settlements {{are referred to as}} a basti.Some Khans came from Iran Usually belongs to Mogals Dinesty, Ghaziuddin Khan and his family belongs to Majhpurwa district Kannauj The city's name is traditionally derived from the term Kanyakubja.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressures}} of <b>indigenization</b> {{and the growing}} acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism {{as opposed to an}} “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by bentuhua, and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a pluralistic society that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.|$|E
25|$|A {{process of}} <b>indigenization</b> has occurred, and the Pathans are now indistinguishable from other Gujarati Muslims. With {{the coming of}} {{independence}} from British rule in 1947, the community has seen the disappearance of their traditional occupations. The greatest concentration of Pathans is {{in the city of}} Baroda, followed by Kaira, Mehsana and Banaskantha. They also have their own villages, and are mainly cultivators. Many are now employed by the State transport corporation as Mechanics, while others have opened garages. As a largely urban community, many are now employed in the textile industry. They are Sunni Muslims, and like other Gujarati Muslims, have their own caste association, the Gujarat Pathan Jamat.|$|E
25|$|During {{his career}} as a mandarin, Diệm was reputable for his workaholism and incorruptibility, a Catholic leader and nationalist. Besides, Catholic {{nationalism}} in Vietnam during 1920s and 1930s facilitated Diệm's ascent in his bureaucratic career. Diệm's rise was also supported through Ngô Đình Khôi's marriage to the daughter of Nguyễn Hữu Bài (1863–1935), the Catholic head of the Council of Ministers at the Huế court and also supported the <b>indigenization</b> of the Vietnamese Church and more administrative powers to the monarchy. Nguyễn Hữu Bài was highly regarded among the French, and Diệm's religious and family ties impressed him and he became Diệm's patron. The French were impressed by his work ethic but were irritated by his frequent calls to grant more autonomy to Vietnam. Diệm replied that he contemplated resigning but encouragement from the populace convinced him to persist. In 1925, he first encountered communists distributing propaganda while riding horseback through the region near Quảng Trị. Revolted by calls for violent socialist revolution contained in the propaganda leaflets, Diệm involved himself in anti-communist activities for the first time, printing his own pamphlets.|$|E
2500|$|From 1937 {{the central}} press started to praise Russian {{language}} and Russian culture. Mass campaigns were organized {{to denounce the}} [...] "enemies of the people". [...] "Bourgeois nationalists" [...] were new enemies of the Russian people which had suppressed the Russian language. The policy of <b>indigenization</b> was abandoned. [...] In the following years the Russian language became a compulsory subject in all Soviet schools.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} synthesize the methods available for the resolution, management or transformation of their ethnic conflict. John Coakley, for example, has developed a [...] of the methods of conflict resolution that have been employed by states, which he lists as: <b>indigenization,</b> accommodation, assimilation, acculturation, population transfer, boundary alteration, genocide and ethnic suicide. John McGarry and Brendan O'Leary have developed a taxonomy of eight macro-political ethnic conflict regulation methods, which they note are often employed by states in combination with each other. They include a number of methods that they note are clearly morally unacceptable.|$|E
2500|$|Each of the {{official}} homelands within the Soviet Union was regarded as the [...] only homeland of the titular nationality and its language, while the Russian language was regarded as the language for interethnic communication for the whole Soviet Union. Therefore, {{for most of the}} Soviet era, especially after the korenizatsiya (<b>indigenization)</b> policy ended in the 1930s, schools in which non-Russian Soviet languages would be taught were not generally available outside the respective ethnically based administrative units of these ethnicities. Some exceptions appeared to involve cases of historic rivalries or patterns of assimilation between neighboring non-Russian groups, such as between Tatars and Bashkirs in Russia or among major Central Asian nationalities. For example, even in the 1970s schooling was offered in at least seven languages in Uzbekistan: Russian, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, and Karakalpak.|$|E
2500|$|The Bentuhua or localization/indigenization {{movement}} was sparked {{in the mid-1970s}} with the growing expression of ethnic discontent due to unequal distribution of political and cultural power between mainlanders and Taiwanese people. Beginning in the 1960s, Taiwan was enveloped by the problems of rapid industrial development, rural abandonment, labor disputes and the uneven distribution of access to wealth and social power. These changes, combined {{with the loss of}} several key allies, forced the KMT regime to institute limited reforms. The reforms permitted under Chiang Ching-kuo allowed <b>indigenization</b> to increase as leading dissidents generated a response to the government’s failures. The dissident groups, united under the [...] "Tangwai", or “outside the party” banner, called for the government to accept the reality that it was only the government of Taiwan and not China. The key demands of the [...] "Tangwai" [...] involved instituting democracy and seeking international recognition as a sovereign state. Taiwanese demanded full civil rights as guaranteed under the ROC constitution and equal political rights as those experienced by the Mainlander elite.|$|E
50|$|Two {{starting}} points {{of research in}} indigenous psychology can be identified: <b>indigenization</b> from without and <b>indigenization</b> from within.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indigenization</b> {{is seen as}} {{the process}} of {{changing}} someone to a person of more corroboration towards their surroundings. A large part of that process is the economy of said surroundings. <b>Indigenization</b> has played an important part in the economic roles of society. Thanks to The <b>Indigenization</b> and Economic Empowerment Act, black people were offered a more distinguished position in the economy, with foreigners having to give up 51% of their business to black people.China’s Open Door Policy is seen as a big step of <b>indigenization</b> for their economy, as it is opening its doors to the western world. This allowed different cultures to experience one another and opened up China’s businesses to the western world as well, which set China forth in a sort of economic reform.|$|E

50|$|Emmerson Mnangagwa has, {{since the}} early 1990s, {{played a key role}} in {{implementing}} the <b>Indigenization</b> & Black Economic Empowerment initiative, as advised by prominent Indigenous Businessmen such as Ben Mucheche, John Mapondera & Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo, Think Tank & Lobby Group IBDC, how to propel the policy from Local policy, Ministerial Policy, Government Policy & Development of a ministry specific to <b>Indigenization</b> & Black Economic Empowerment, such as <b>Indigenization</b> and Economic Empowerment Bill. Mnangagwa believes that the national resources should be protected by the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.|$|E
50|$|Another {{big part}} of <b>indigenization</b> is social work, {{although}} it is unknown what the actual process is when social forces come into place. <b>Indigenization</b> is seen by some as less of a process of naturalization {{and more of a}} process of culturally relevant social work. While <b>indigenization</b> wasn’t the standard, {{it was a way to}} not only accustom others to a surrounding point of view, but also helping understand both where these people came from and also their heritage. However, some argue that while the <b>indigenization</b> of social work may work when it comes to foreigners being brought into Western cultures, it would not work as well non-Western cultures were those that were being taken in. They also argue that Western cultures seem to exaggerate the similarities and differences between Western and foreign cultures.|$|E

50|$|Throughout history, {{the process}} of making {{something}} indigenous has taken different forms. Other words that describe similar processes of making something local are Africanization, , Glocalization, and Americanization. However, these terms describe a specific case of {{the process of}} making something indigenous. These terms may be rejected in favor of the more general term of <b>indigenization</b> because the others may have too narrow of a scope. For example, Christianization was a form of <b>indigenization</b> by converting areas and groups to follow Christianity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Indigenization</b> is the act {{of making}} {{something}} more native; transformation of some service, idea, etc. to suit a local culture, especially {{through the use of}} more indigenous people in administration, employment, etc.|$|E
50|$|The word <b>indigenization</b> first {{appeared}} in a paper about studies conducted in India about Christian missionaries. The word was {{used to describe the}} process of making Churches indigenous in southern India. From there, it spread to The Economist where it was used to describe managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named English Language in West Africa, where it was used to describe the adoption of English. <b>Indigenization</b> is often used to describe the adoption of colonial culture in Africa because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Africanization or Africanisation (lit., making {{something}} African) {{has been applied}} in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and {{in the composition of}} the civil service e.g. via processes such as <b>indigenization.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the word}} <b>indigenization</b> {{is also used}} in almost the {{opposite}} sense, it means: to increase local participation in or ownership of, to indigenize foreign-owned companies, or to adapt (beliefs, customs, etc.) to local ways.|$|E

[...] Analyzing the works of Nazi Boni, Ahmadou Kourouma, and Patrice Nganang, Vakunta concludes that [...] "indigenization of language constitutes the single most effective tool with which postcolonial African writers attempt to individualize the use of the French language," [...] calling for further research into the controversial aspects of language usage in postcolonial literature.|$|E
