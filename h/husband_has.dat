5000|$|Another {{especially}} controversial {{aspect of}} female perpetrated IPV is {{the theory of}} [...] "battered husband syndrome." [...] In light {{of the findings of}} the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to [...] "battered wife syndrome." [...] Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both <b>husbands</b> and wives <b>had</b> thrown objects; 17% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object.|$|R

5|$|Howard gets a {{call from}} her sister, who has {{recently}} found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been having an affair.

A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and {{a crowd of people}} with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling through the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk.

Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal.

5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|While it {{is widely}} assumed that the problem lies {{primarily}} in men refusing to grant a get to their wives {{and that it is}} a widespread issue, in Israel, figures released from the chief rabbinate show that women equally refuse to accept a get and that the numbers are a couple of hundred on each side. However, such a <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> the option of seeking a Heter meah rabbanim, while no similar option exists for the wife.|$|E

25|$|The {{same goes}} for {{readings}} of literary texts says Pommier. For example, Molière's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons, not all of them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but {{because he has been}} promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal <b>Husband,</b> <b>has</b> been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.|$|E
25|$|Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites {{from having}} sexual {{intercourse}} with {{the wife of}} another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, {{and a woman who}} was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery. This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the <b>husband</b> <b>has</b> an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.|$|E
