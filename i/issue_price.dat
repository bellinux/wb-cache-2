5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} {{much of the}} issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the <b>issue</b> <b>price.</b> The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original <b>issue</b> <b>price,</b> several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

30|$|According to (4), we can {{conclude}} that under the issuing mechanism of bookbuilding, a monotone, increasing linear corresponding relation exists between the IPO <b>issuing</b> <b>price</b> and institutional investor private information ∑_i= 1 ^ns_i. Therefore, participants may infer ∑_i= 1 ^ns_i {{by virtue of the}} <b>issuing</b> <b>price,</b> {{and at the end of}} the zero period, institutional investor private information ∑_i= 1 ^ns_i will become participant common knowledge.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{asymmetric}} information assumption, borrowers are better informed than lenders about {{the persistence of}} their output shocks. If borrowers default at first period, upon observing this default, lenders will make an inference about the likely realization {{of the magnitude of}} borrowers’ first period shocks indirectly and update their expectations to be pessimistic on borrowers’ future output and their repayment prospects on future loans. Although borrowers can get fresh lending again, they need to pay higher interest rates than the case they did not default in the past. The gap between the interest rates for fresh lending with and without past default is defined as default premium, which can also be seen as the difference between the new debt <b>issue</b> <b>prices</b> with and without past default. Therefore, if borrowers default, they will face a positive default premium, namely higher interest rates and lower new debt <b>issuing</b> <b>price.</b> If the investment requirement is relatively inelastic, in another word, the amount of investment requirement relatively not affected by debt <b>issuing</b> <b>price,</b> borrowers have to issue more debts to compensate for low <b>issue</b> <b>prices</b> to acquire the required amount of investment. As a result, the ratio of debt to expected output increases and induce higher probability of future default.|$|R
25|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> {{at which}} investors buy the bonds {{when they are}} first issued will {{typically}} be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the <b>issue</b> <b>price,</b> less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or {{there is a high}} probability of default on the bond).|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the RCM {{issued a}} {{medallion}} to commemorate Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The {{composition of the}} medal is 50% pure silver and has a diameter of 36mm. The coin had a production limit of 100,000 and its <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> was $24.50.|$|E
25|$|Medallions honouring hockey legends {{have also}} been created. To commemorate Mario Lemieux's {{induction}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame, a special set honouring all the inductees was issued in 1997. In 1999, a nickel medallion was issued to honour Wayne Gretzky's retirement. The <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> was $9.99 with a mintage of 50,000.|$|E

30|$|Under the bookbuilding mechanism, {{the issuer}} first invites {{institutional}} investors for tender offers and determines the <b>issuing</b> <b>price</b> {{according to their}} offer information and total amount of placements, {{and the rest of}} the shares are placed with retail investors based on the <b>issuing</b> <b>price.</b> Rational institutional investors generally take the estimate of the IPO intrinsic value as the offer basis during the purchase offer. The placement rule for institutional investors’ quantity discrimination can lead to truthful disclosure of private information during IPO bookbuilding (Benveniste and Spindt, 1989); therefore, this paper excludes the possibility of investors hiding information. Although in practice, institutional investors only report limited pair (price and quantity demand) combinations, this paper assumes that they report continuous demand curves to simplify the analysis.|$|R
25|$|The new mint logo (not a Mint Mark), {{a symbol}} of the Royal Canadian Mint’s {{reputation}} for high quality and innovation, was added to all Circulation Coins on the obverse ("heads") side depicting Queen Elizabeth II. A Special Edition Uncirculated Set was also released with all the coins featuring the brand new Mint Mark, with a limited mintage of 30,000 and an <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> of $19.95.|$|E
25|$|According to a European Commission working paper, {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at least to some extent in lower current share prices. For firms which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> of new shares would be lower than without the tax.|$|E
25|$|After the Olympic coin venture, the numismatic line {{expanded}} to include $100 Gold coins. These were premium coins that sold for higher than face value. The common <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> from 1977 to 1979 ranged from $140 to $180. The cases for these coins tended to be brown or black leatherette cases with maroon or blue inserts, and a Certificate of Authenticity.

25|$|Two years later, the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority of Macau {{commissioned}} the Royal Canadian Mint {{to create a}} commemorative coin to recognize {{the transfer of the}} Macau region to the People’s Republic of China. The coin is silver and featured a gold cameo. The face value is 100 patacas and had a diameter of 37.97mm and a guaranteed weight of at least 1 troy ounce (31.1034768 grams), while most 1 oz silver R.C.M. coins weigh 31.3 grams. The Royal Canadian Mint item number is 644309 and the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> is $102. The coin features a Portuguese ship and a Chinese barque sharing coastal waters. The historic Ma Gao Temple (Pagoda de Barra) appears in the cameo.|$|E
25|$|This {{was only}} the {{beginning}} for the RCM. The advent of the Two Hundred Dollar Gold series was quickly joined by a Platinum series. These high quality collector coins solidified the RCM's entry into the luxury coin market. A four coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Famed artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs. The <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> for these collections was around $1,990 and the casing was a walnut or burgundy (for 1994) case with a black suede four hole insert and a Certificate of Authenticity.|$|E
25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E

Therefore, when the issuer risk is neutral, namely ρ[*]=[*] 0, the IPO <b>issuing</b> <b>price</b> {{is equal to the}} Ē(U) IPO prospective value.

500|$|The coins did {{not sell}} well, and most were later melted. [...] Zerbe, who {{had promised to}} support the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> of the coins, {{did not do so}} as prices dropped once the fair (rescheduled for 1904) closed. [...] This drop, however, did not greatly affect Zerbe's career, as he went on to promote other {{commemorative}} coins and become president of the American Numismatic Association. [...] The coins also recovered, regaining their <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> by 1915; they are now worth between a few hundred and several thousand dollars, depending on condition.|$|E
500|$|The {{bill for}} the Elgin coin did not pass until 1936.

500|$|Despite Zerbe's {{statement}} that he would support the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> of the coins at $3, {{he did not do}} so and the price of the dollars fell to about $2 by late 1905. Their market price again reached $3 by about 1915, and thereafter continued to rise. [...] The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book) lists both the Jefferson and the McKinley variety at prices ranging from $500 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) condition to $2,150 in near pristine MS-66 condition, though the Jefferson is more expensive in some intermediate grades.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the coins}} were minted, the {{commission}} began sales at $2 each. [...] After February 1900, when the commission moved its offices from Chicago to Paris, sales were {{handled by the}} American Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago. Only small numbers were sold to coin collectors. Sales, conducted through the bank, continued for several years. [...] Prices initially dropped on the secondary market—the pieces could be purchased for $1.10 in 1903—and thousands may have been released into circulation, or were spent by purchasers in hard times. By 1920, the market price passed the original <b>issue</b> <b>price,</b> and thereafter prices rose steadily, reaching $3.50 by 1930, $5 {{at the height of}} the commemorative coin boom in July 1936, $13 by 1950, $55 by 1960, and $650 by 1975.|$|E

Nevertheless, {{the value of the}} Lewis and Clark issue did not drop below <b>issue</b> <b>price,</b> but steadily increased. [...] Despite a slightly higher number of coins recorded as extant, the 1905 issue is rarer and more valuable than the 1904; Bowers speculates that Zerbe may have held some pieces only to cash them in, or surrender them in 1933 when President Franklin Roosevelt called in most gold coins. The 1905 for many years traded for less than the 1904, but by 1960 had matched the earlier version's price and in the 1980s surpassed it. The 2014 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book) lists the 1904 at between $900 and $10,000, depending on condition, and the 1905 at between $1,200 and $15,000.
