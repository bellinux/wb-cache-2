25|$|Similarly, {{at a fixed}} {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which {{is greater than the}} critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts {{in the absence of a}} field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> at zero magnetic field) the two <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the superconducting band and consequently a longer London penetration depth of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} pathway for "chemiosmotic" <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> transduction {{in active}} transport is discussed with an ATP-driven Ca 2 + pump as an illustrative example. Two innovations {{are made in}} the analysis. (i) <b>Free</b> <b>energy</b> dissipated as heat is rigorously excluded from overall <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> bookkeeping by focusing on the dynamic equilibrium state of the chemiosmotic process. (ii) Separate chemical potential terms for <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> donor and transported ions are used {{to keep track of the}} thermodynamic state of each substrate through the reaction cycle. These procedures clarify the mechanism of <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> transduction, even without step-by-step analysis. The results show that <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> exchange must occur in its entirety among protein-bound species. Imposition of conditions for an adequate rate of physiological function further indicates (i) that the standard <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> of hydrolysis of protein-bound ATP (to yield protein-bound products) needs to differ substantially from the standard <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> of hydrolysis in solution and (ii) that binding sites for the transported ions must have different affinities when facing opposite sides of the membrane. The results also demonstrate that step-by-step "basic" <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> changes (often used in the form of <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> level diagrams) are inherently unsuited for analysis of the mechanism of <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> transduction...|$|R

2500|$|Phi value {{analysis}} is an experimental protein engineering method {{used to study}} {{the structure of the}} folding transition state in small protein domains that fold in a two-state manner. Since the folding transition state is by definition a transient and partially unstructured state, its structure is difficult to determine by traditional methods such as protein NMR or X-ray crystallography. [...] In phi-value analysis, the folding kinetics and conformational folding stability of the wild-type protein are compared with those of one or more point mutants. [...] This comparison yields a phi value (defined below) that seeks to measure the mutated residue's energetic contribution to the folding transition state (and thus the degree of native structure around the mutated residue in the transition state) from the relative <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of the unfolded state, the folded state and the transition state for the wild-type and mutant proteins.|$|E
2500|$|In {{computational}} physics {{and more specifically}} in quantum mechanics, the ground state energies of quantum systems {{is associated with the}} top of the spectrum of Schrödinger's operators. The Schrödinger equation is the quantum mechanics version of the Newton's second law of motion of classical mechanics (the mass times the acceleration is the sum of the forces). This equation represents the wave function (a.k.a. the quantum state) evolution of some physical system, including molecular, atomic of subatomic systems, as well as macroscopic systems like the universe. The solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation (a.k.a. the heat equation) is given by a Feynman-Kac distribution associated with a free evolution [...] Markov process (often represented by Brownian motions) in the set of electronic or macromolecular configurations and some potential energy function. The long time behavior of these nonlinear semigroups is related to top eigenvalues and ground state energies of [...] Schrödinger's operators. [...] The genetic type mean field interpretation of these Feynman-Kac models are termed Resample Monte Carlo, or Diffusion Monte Carlo methods. These branching type evolutionary algorithms are based on mutation and selection transitions. During the mutation transition, the walkers evolve randomly and independently in a potential energy landscape on particle configurations. [...] The mean field selection process (a.k.a. quantum teleportation, population reconfiguration, resampled transition) is associated with a fitness function that [...] reflects the particle absorption in an energy well. Configurations with low relative energy are more likely to duplicate. In molecular chemistry, and statistical physics Mean field particle methods are also used to sample Boltzmann-Gibbs measures associated with some cooling schedule, and to compute their normalizing constants (a.k.a. <b>free</b> <b>energies,</b> or partition functions).|$|E
