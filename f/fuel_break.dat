40|$|Abstract. Aswildfires have {{increased}} in frequency and extent, so have the number of homes developed in the wildland– urban interface. In California, the predominant approach to mitigating fire risk is construction of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks,</b> {{but there has been}} little empirical study of their role in controlling large fires. We constructed a spatial database of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> on the Los Padres National Forest in southern California to better understand characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> that affect the behaviour of large fires and tomapwhere fires and fuel breaksmost commonly intersect. We evaluatedwhether fires stopped or crossed over <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> over a 28 -year period and compared the outcomes with physical characteristics of the sites, weather and firefighting activities during the fire event. Many <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> never intersected fires, but others intersected several, primarily in historically fire-prone areas. Fires stopped at <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> 46 % of the time, almost invariably owing to fire suppression activities. Firefighter access to treatments, smaller fires and longer <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> were significant direct influences, and younger vegetation and fuel breakmaintenance indirectly improved the outcome by facilitating firefighter access. This study illustrates the importance of strategic location of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> because they have been most effective where they provided access for firefighting activities...|$|R

40|$|The loss of {{sagebrush}} steppe to uncharacteristically {{large and}} frequent wildfires {{has been identified}} as a primary threat to Greater Sage-Grouse (GSG) populations in the western portion of the species’ range. Policy documents regularly identify the need for landscape-scale approaches to design and implement fuel treatments (e. g., <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks)</b> to prevent loss of habitat to wildfires. In an effort to help federal and state agencies reduce the impact of large wildfires, we developed a GIS approach that uses Circuitscape to identify strategic locations for <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> and simulate potential <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> to protect remaining large patches of important GSG habitat. As a demonstration, we applied our experimental approach to a 27 -million acre (110, 000 km 2) region that includes parts of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. We used the Circuitscape model to identify a set of strategic locations for <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> and simulate potential <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> with different levels of resistance to fire. We proposed six focal geographies in our Project Area for further investigation for designing and implementing <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks.</b> From the beginning, we knew the detailed design and implementation of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> would require close collaboration with public land fire managers. We have discovered that even preliminary design of a network of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> will require close collaboration with local experts, especially BLM fuels management staff.

Besides encouraging others to test our Circuitscape approach for modeling <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks,</b> we intend to pursue a collaboration with fire managers in {{at least one of the}} focal geographies we identified...|$|R
40|$|In {{wildfire}} management, a {{spot fire}} {{is the result}} of an airborne ember igniting a separate fire away from the main wildfire. Under certain environmental and wildfire conditions, a burning ember can breach a <b>fuel</b> <b>break,</b> such as a river or road, and result in the production of a spot fire. This project derives distributions of the time to the first spot fire in various situations, and verifies them by simulation. To demonstrate the implementation of the distributions in practice, we incorporate a stochastic fire spread model.

40|$|Government Agencies {{for decades}} have {{utilized}} {{state and federal}} funds to clear trees and brush around homes and recreational property {{to reduce the risk}} of wildfire damage. In Utah many fire breaks in gamble oak dominated sites are difficult to maintain due to rough terrain, resprouting gamble oak and the increased production of fine fuels following brush removal. These sites also tend to fill in and become thicker than pretreatment conditions leaving the area more vulnerable to fire than before. Some <b>fuel</b> <b>break</b> maintenance options include herbicides and or mechanical brush removal. Both of these methods require investments of time and money to maintain. These methods use large quantities of fossil fuel and or pesticides that can be expensive and harmful to the environment. The financial burden can become difficult for landowners when 30 public funding sources dry up. Livestock grazing is a method capable of maintaining fuel breaks.

The station is located north of the Zona da Mata Mineira, which is inserted {{in the domain of}} the Atlantic Forest, MG, Brazil. The work was based on the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and aerial photos unconventional. The total area studied was 895. 86 ha. Of this total, 584. 07 ha is occupied by agriculture and pasture. This last class, were 548. 40 ha of pasture, composing 61. 21 % of the total area. This category is represented by a fuel material of small size and therefore high power ignition, highlighting the vulnerability of the area to fire. Among the 6. 32 kilometers of <b>fuel</b> <b>break,</b> had 4. 72 kilometers of forest regeneration from the outside and 1. 60 km of pasture, alternating between one and another type of land use along its length. Approximately 20 % of the <b>fuel</b> <b>break</b> that borders the pasture has slopes greater than 30 degrees; 61 % slope between 16 and 30 degrees and 19 % between 0 and 15 degrees.

Two fuel management scenarios covering 3 % of the fire-prone Algarve region of Portugal and differing in the intensity of treatment in 120 -m wide fuel breaks were examined and compared with the no-treatment option.

Risk transmission among municipalities varied with community. Although fire distribution shifted and large events were less frequent, mean treatment leverage was very low (1 : 26), revealing a very high cost–benefit ratio and the need for engaging forest owners to act in complementary area-wide fuel treatments.

Within this framework, the spatial distribution of <b>fuel</b> <b>breaks</b> is reduced {{to the problem of}} finding the network nodes among which the fire spreads faster, thus their removal favours the inhibition of the fire propagation.

They were also located opposite fuel breaks (bulldozer-lines, dirt roads, or paved roads) to minimize the potential for fuel differences between burned and unburned vegetation at the time of each fire. Originally, over 20 unique sites that had burned were identified in the study area from aerial photography but, after ground-truthing each site in July and August of 2006, only seven were selected for this study. Sites were dismissed from the study if they lacked suitable unburned reference vegetation (i.e., unburned vegetation adjacent to burned vegetation {{did not appear to be}} separated by a <b>fuel</b> <b>break</b> so differences in fuel between the two areas may have existed at the time of fire). Other reasons for dismissal were recent grazing history (based on sightings of livestock, the presence of trails and ruts indicative of livestock, drinking troughs, scat, and browsed vegetation within large fenced-in areas), and irregular soil type (based on NRCS soils maps or percent sand, silt, and clay analyses [Steers 2008]). Lastly, because of the strong precipitation gradient in the study area, additional sites adjacent to Cabazon and Palm Springs were removed to minimize climatic variation.
