2500|$|The {{camp was}} hastily built at an {{elevation}} of , {{so it was not}} well suited for the harsh winters typical of Oregon's high desert country. [...] As a result, the men had a very difficult winter. [...] It was reported that on several occasions, it was so cold inside the camp building the entire detachment had to march around the parade ground all night to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> [...] One sergeant did freeze to death during a winter snow storm.|$|E
60|$|It grew colder that night, {{and it was}} all {{the explorers}} could do to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> They had a small {{quantity}} of tea left--a quarter of a pound--and after melting some snow over their alcohol stove, drank the beverage boiling hot. Then they made themselves a hot stew of pemmican and ground-up peas. Each of the dogs received a chunk of frozen walrus meat, something they gnawed on savagely, so great was their hunger.|$|E
60|$|For {{one brief}} moment the little hunter stood with upturned face, while Mooka {{bowed her head}} silently, and the great storm rolled unheeded over them. Still holding his long bow he {{stretched}} both hands to the sky in the mute appeal that Keesuolukh, the Great Mystery whom we call God, would understand better than all words. Then turning {{their backs to the}} gale they drifted swiftly away before it, like two wind-blown leaves, running to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> and holding each other's hands tight lest they separate and be lost by the way.|$|E
60|$|He rose {{somewhat}} unsteadily, and lurched {{across to}} the window. La Boulaye followed him, and gazing out under his indication, he beheld the coach by the blaze of a fire which the men had lighted to <b>keep</b> them <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> at their post.|$|R
50|$|Obviously, {{keeping your}} feet warm {{is a problem}} in high {{altitude}} climbing — but only if you have feet. While companions war-dance to <b>keep</b> theirs <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> I can stand on ice for hours. Climbing high or in a bivouac, I'm always the joker who doesn't have cold feet.|$|R
50|$|Roe {{also took}} part in the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne. Allied {{supplies}} were low and Roe had to go from man to man to get more supplies. In the extreme cold weather, he had to tuck plasma bottles into his armpits to <b>keep</b> them <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm {{glad you}} began at once, and {{hope you will}} keep on. But I {{want to say one}} word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six {{children}} are huddled into one bed to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?" ...|$|E
60|$|Towards {{morning they}} {{fell into a}} heavy sleep; for the big stub began to burn more freely as the wind changed, and they need not stir every half hour to feed their little fire and <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> It was broad daylight, the storm had ceased, and a {{woodpecker}} was hammering loudly on a hollow shell over their heads when they started up, wondering vaguely where they were. Then while Noel broke out of the commoosie, which was fairly buried under the snow, {{to find out where}} he was, Mooka rebuilt the fire and plucked a ptarmigan and set it to toasting with the last of their bread over the coals.|$|E
60|$|We were a happy, noisy gang, and {{undoubtedly}} gave poor Mrs. Leete a {{great deal}} of trouble. There was Boggs (who had lost part of one ear in some fracas with Jack Frost) who paced up and down his room declining Latin verbs with painful pertinacity, and Burton who loved a jest but never made one, and Joe Pritchard, who was interested mainly in politics and oratory, and finally that criminally well-dressed young book agent (with whom we had very little in common) and myself. In cold weather we all herded in the dining room to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> and our weekly scrub took place after we got home to our own warm kitchens and the family wash-tubs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine cap vos gone," [...] growled the German cadet dismally. [...] "How vos I {{going to}} <b>keep</b> mine head <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> tole me dot, vill you?" ...|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the objects}} have storied providence, {{including}} those plundering from the estates of aristocrats in {{the years of the}} French revolutionary army's occupation of the Southern Netherlands. The Hunt of the Unicorn was for a period used by the French army to cloak potatoes and <b>keep</b> them <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> over.|$|R
60|$|Lisle {{could not}} {{remember}} how long he waited, beating his stiffened hands and stumbling to and fro to <b>keep</b> his feet <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> but at last, though he could see nothing, he heard a crunching sound, and he called out sharply.|$|R
60|$|Messner {{broke the}} skin that had formed on the water-hole within the hour, and filled his pails. But {{he did not}} return {{immediately}} to the cabin. Leaving the pails standing in the trail, he walked up and down, rapidly, to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> for the frost bit into the flesh like fire. His beard was white with his frozen breath when the perplexed and frowning brows relaxed and decision came into his face. He had {{made up his mind}} to his course of action, and his frigid lips and cheeks crackled into a chuckle over it. The pails were already skinned over with young ice when he picked them up and made for the cabin.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while the}} snow ceased and they could dimly see the dark pines {{climbing}} the steep banks that shut them in. It was obvious that if Mitcham's party had entered the deep hollow, they could not well get out of it. The expedition had only to go on or wait until it met them; but Kermode did not envy the man whose duty {{it would be to}} ride across the open waste to the lonely post where Sergeant Inglis might be found. Resting, however, was out of the question. They must move to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> and though the snow began again, they plodded on, with heads lowered to meet the blast that drove the stinging flakes into their faces.|$|E
60|$|They {{ran back}} to the river bank, and ran along up it till they were {{out of sight of the}} boys on the shore below, and then they made their oven in it, and started their fire with some matches that Jim Leonard had in his pocket, so that if he ever got lost in the woods at night he could make a fire and <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> His tooth had stopped aching now, and he kept telling such {{exciting}} stories about Indians that Pony could not seem to get the chance to ask why Bunty Williams should take after the boys with his shotgun and bulldog if he had given up the watermelon patch and only wanted it for seed.|$|E
60|$|Once, in winter, it {{occurred}} to me that soaking spoiled the flavor of bark, and that the beavers might like a fresh bite. So I cut a hole in the ice on the pool above their dam. Of course the chopping scared the beavers; it was vain to experiment that day. I spread a blanket and some thick boughs over the hole to <b>keep</b> it <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> over too thickly, and went away.|$|R
40|$|This {{activity}} {{helps students}} to understand the many roles that polar sea ice plays in the systems that maintain our planet, by first helping them to understand {{the process of the}} formation of ice in oceanic regimes. Students will use an inquiry based lab experience relating salt content to the ability of water to freeze in order to begin this study. Specifically, they will design an experiment to determine if salt <b>keeps</b> seawater <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> Educational levels: Middle school...|$|R
50|$|Some modern coolers are thermoelectric, {{plugging}} into a car's {{cigarette lighter}} socket. Rather than using a compressor and refrigerant {{such as a}} refrigerator or other heat pump, these use the Peltier effect along with an external fan to draw away the heat. By reversing the current, this concept can also heat the contents instead of cooling them, useful for keeping meals hot from a drive-through, or even to <b>keep</b> items <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> in severely cold climates.|$|R
6000|$|Wetherbee. [...] Oh, {{there is}} nothing mean [...] About your early friend. That deer and autumn scene [...] Were kind of you! And, say, I think you like [...] Afternoon teas when good.

60|$|Fording the river, he {{proceeded}} to {{the borders of the}} deep snow, when he encamped under the lee of immense piles of burned rock. On the 21st he was again floundering through the snow, on the great Snake River plain, where it lay to the depth of thirty inches. It was sufficiently incrusted to bear a pedestrian, but the poor horses broke through the crust, and plunged and strained at every step. So lacerated were they by the ice that it was necessary to change the front every hundred yards, and put a different one in advance to break the way. The open prairies were swept by a piercing and biting wind from the northwest. At night, they had to task their ingenuity to provide shelter and <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> In the first place, they dug deep holes in the snow, piling it up in ramparts to windward as a protection against the blast. Beneath these they spread buffalo skins, upon which they stretched themselves in full dress, with caps, cloaks, and moccasins, and covered themselves with numerous blankets; notwithstanding all which they were often severely pinched with the cold.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was then}} that Jack did them a service. With that {{engaging}} recklessness of consequences which is natural to youth, and so proper and so seemly, as well, he went {{and led the way}} across the Jordan, and all was happiness again. Every individual waded over, then, and stood upon the further bank. The water was not quite breast deep, any where. If it had been more, we could hardly have accomplished the feat, for the strong current would have swept us down the stream, and we would have been exhausted and drowned before reaching a place where we could make a landing. The main object compassed, the drooping, miserable party sat down to wait for the sun again, for all wanted to see the water as well as feel it. But it was too cold a pastime. Some cans were filled from the holy river, some canes cut from its banks, and then we mounted and rode reluctantly away to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> to death. So we saw the Jordan very dimly. The thickets of bushes that bordered its banks threw their shadows across its shallow, turbulent waters ("stormy," [...] the hymn makes them, which is rather a complimentary stretch of fancy,) and we could not judge of the width of the stream by the eye. We knew by our wading experience, however, that many streets in America are double as wide as the Jordan.|$|E
50|$|In 1889, {{the last}} of the {{expansions}} took place. A much larger Commanding officer's Quarters was built on the northern end of Officer's Row replacing the 1872 Hazen Quarters which then became the Field Officer's Quarters. A water tower was built towards the river and attempts were made at installing water mains to the structures. The attempt failed however, because they could not bury the pipes deep enough to <b>keep</b> them <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> every Winter with the last attempt at 8 feet.|$|R

5000|$|A {{hydration}} pack {{is a type}} of hydration system {{built as}} a backpack or waistpack containing a reservoir or [...] "bladder" [...] commonly made of rubber or flexible plastic. The reservoir contains a capped mouth for filling with liquid and a hose that allows the wearer to drink hands-free. Most hoses end with a [...] "bite valve" [...] that opens when the user bites down on it; the valve may be protected by a dust cover. Some hydration packs are insulated to <b>keep</b> water <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> or becoming warm.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the hunters}} {{detailed}} from Wayne's command {{to supply the}} officers with game while the army lay at Greenville in 1793 was the Indian fighter, Josiah Hunt, who died a peaceful Methodist many years afterwards. When he passed a winter in the woods he had to build a fire to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> and yet guard against letting the slightest gleam of light be seen by a prowling foe. So he dug a hole six or seven inches deep with his tomahawk, filled it with the soft lining of dead oak bark, and with his flint started a fire. He left two holes at the edges to breathe the flame; then covered the pit with earth, spread brush over it, and seated himself on the heap, with his blanket drawn over his head, and dozed through the night. The Indians had a great honor and admiration for him, and {{when they came to}} make peace at Greenville, after Fallen Timbers, they all wanted to see Captain Hunt. [...] "Great man, Captain Hunt," [...] they said. [...] "Great warrior--good hunting man-Indian no can kill," [...] and they told him they had tried to find out the secret of his fire, and catch him off his guard so that they could get his scalp, which they felt would have been the highest distinction they could have achieved, next to getting General Wayne's scalp. He was indeed both hunted and hunter. He never fired at a deer without first putting a bullet in his mouth to reload for an Indian, who might be about to fire on him. When he skinned a deer, he planted his back against a tree, and stood his rifle by his side; from time to time he stopped and listened for the slightest noise that hinted danger. His life had its disappointments as well as its perils. Once he saw three Indians whom he might easily have killed at one shot if he could have got them in range, but they persisted in walking Indian file. If he fired and killed only one, the other two would have killed him; so he was obliged to let them all go. Captain Hunt was a quiet, modest man, very frank and sincere, and seems never to have boasted of his exploits; we have no means of knowing whether he was glad or sorry that those Indians got away in safety. Probably he was not very glad; for though the fighters on both sides could admire, they could never spare one another.|$|E

5000|$|The sourdough {{tradition}} was carried into Alaska {{and the western}} Canadian territories during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Conventional leavenings such as yeast and baking soda were much less reliable in the conditions faced by the prospectors. Experienced miners and other settlers frequently carried a pouch of starter either around their neck or on a belt; these were fiercely guarded to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> However, freezing does not kill a sourdough starter; excessive heat does. Old hands {{came to be called}} [...] "sourdoughs", a term that is still applied to any Alaskan or Klondike old-timer. The significance of the nickname's association with Yukon culture was immortalized in the writings of Robert Service, particularly his collection of [...] "Songs of a Sourdough".|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact at this point they saw the rifle barrel raised. Pierre {{abruptly}} turned and without once looking back rejoined the two men in the thicket. He was in a towering rage and spat out French invectives at a rate to defy description. He reported the result of his mission, stating his opinion that the Indian could hold out indefinitely, as there was a plentiful supply of grub in the cabin and enough fire-wood to <b>keep</b> him <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> for longer than his besiegers would care to stay.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{rest was}} burned, sir, to <b>keep</b> us <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> to death," [...] Roswell then gave {{a brief but}} very clear and intelligible account of what had happened, and of {{the manner in which}} he had caused the hulk of the deacon's Sea Lion to be raised upon by the {{materials}} furnished by the Sea Lion of the Vineyard.

As for the deacon, he might have said, with Shakspeare's Wolsey, ...|$|R
25|$|Beavers do not hibernate, but store {{sticks and}} logs {{in a pile}} in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is {{generally}} above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often <b>keeps</b> the water <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> {{in and around the}} food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.|$|R
5000|$|Allman {{later called}} Dowd {{to let him}} know that his band was in town to perform a benefit concert on 26 August. When Clapton learned of this from Dowd he insisted on going to see their show, saying, [...] "You mean that guy who plays on the back of (Wilson Pickett's) 'Hey Jude'? … I want to see him play … let's go." [...] Clapton and company managed to sit in front of the {{barricade}} separating the audience from the stage. When they sat down, Allman was playing a solo. As he turned around and opened his eyes and saw Clapton, he froze. Dickey Betts, the Allmans' other lead guitarist, took up where Allman left off, but when he followed Allman's eyes to Clapton, he had to turn his back to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> himself.|$|E
5000|$|After {{living in}} an {{apartment}} in Minnesota, Honkala and her young son were forced to move out and live out of their white Camaro. She and her son became homeless after the Camaro was demolished by a drunk driver. Honkala {{could not find a}} shelter {{that would allow them to}} remain together that winter. To stay together and <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> Honkala decided to move into an abandoned Housing and Urban Development (HUD) home. She would later comment, [...] "I chose to live, and I chose to keep my son alive." [...] She called a press conference, in which she said, [...] "This is me, this is my nine-year-old son, and we're not leaving until somebody can tell us where we can live and not freeze to death." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the movie}} {{is based on a}} true story, the story of the Montreal Accueil Bonneau Choir (also known as the Montreal Homeless Choir), and its founder and director Pierre Anthian. Just one example of how this choir has transformed the lives of its members is the story of Nicolas “Colas” Allaire. When he joined the choir he was in his 60's. Colas was raised in an orphanage until age 17. With no formal education and no family, friends, or money, he was never able to find work. In winter he made snow caves to <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>freezing</b> to death. Sometimes he committed crimes just to be put in jail so he would have food to eat every day. Since joining the choir, he says, “my life has been paradise. I have made friends, and I have started to support myself. I now have a small apartment, and I am happy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the terrible}} winter of 1723, {{when the snow}} lay so thick over the {{landscape}} that the residents could not access their woodlot, another Avery chopped {{off the top of}} the tree to <b>keep</b> his family <b>from</b> <b>freezing.</b> [...] By the 1790s, the Avery Oak’s gnarled and crooked branches spread more than 90 feet from a trunk five feet in diameter.|$|R
60|$|Late in the autumn, {{the captain}} rejoined {{his family in}} Albany, quitting the field for winter quarters. He left {{sergeant}} Joyce, in garrison, supported by Nick, a miller, the mason, carpenter, {{and three of the}} axe-men. Their duty was to prepare materials for the approaching season, {{to take care of the}} stock, to put in winter crops, to make a few bridges, clear out a road or two, haul wood to <b>keep</b> themselves <b>from</b> <b>freezing,</b> to build a log barn and some sheds, and otherwise to advance the interests of the settlement. They were also to commence a house for the patentee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear boy" [...] (these {{words were}} always written in English), so ran the last letter from that house {{received}} in London--"Get yourself {{driven to the}} only inn in the place, dine {{as well as you}} can, and some time in the evening my own confidential servant, factotum and majordomo, a Mr. V. S. (I warn you he is of noble extraction), will present himself before you, reporting the arrival of the small sledge which will take you here on the next day.
