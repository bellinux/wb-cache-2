5|$|Shapinsay has {{a primary}} school, {{which in the}} 2006–7 {{academic}} year had 26 pupils. Before 1995, the island also had a secondary school but lost this because of falling enrolment and improved transport links with Kirkwall, to where Shapinsay secondary pupils now travel. The school <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> a community centre and is host to a learning centre supported by the UHI Millennium Institute. This centre uses the internet, email and video-conferencing to allow students in Shapinsay to study without leaving the island.|$|E

5|$|These {{costs are}} {{surprisingly}} high—one agent who represents an unnamed NBA player set to earn $10 {{million in the}} 2010–11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to insure his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The Spanish Basketball Federation said that insuring all the NBA players on its national team for EuroBasket 2011, which <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> the European Olympic qualifiers, could {{cost as much as}} $5.67 million. Basketball Australia announced that Andrew Bogut would not be available for the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not insure his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Final Fantasy games, players cannot {{manually}} equip characters with armor. Instead, newly acquired armor replaces the main character's current equipment, or upgrades a {{current version of}} a weapon, e.g. obtaining the knight sword will replace the steel sword. Using the L and R buttons allows the user to cycle through the weapons that have been collected so far. Benjamin uses four types of weapons: swords, axes, bombs, and claws. Although the weapons share a similar function in battle, all have different purposes when exploring the field map. The Dragon Claw, for example, <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> a grappling hook. The weapon arsenal in Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is considerably smaller than most role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|El-Dawlatly {{had been}} {{fourth in the}} singles at the 2011 All-Africa Games, as well as third in the doubles and mixed doubles (with Meshref and Lashin respectively), {{and was a member}} of the gold medal-winning Egyptian team. She had also earned gold in the team event and the doubles and silver in the singles at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London she was {{defeated}} in the opening round by Denmark's Mie Skov. Meshref had the same results as El-Dawlatly at the 2011 All-African Games, except for being fifth in the singles, and took gold in the singles, doubles, and team events at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London she defeated Offiong Edem of Nigeria and Yana Noskova of Russia before being overcome by Romania's Elizabeta Samara. For the team event, El-Dawlatly and Meshref were joined by Raghd Magdy, who had been third in the doubles and mixed <b>doubles,</b> <b>as</b> well as runner-up in the team competition, at the 2003 All-Africa Games. The Egyptian women were defeated by the Dutch in the first round.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

40|$|In {{what follows}} {{the idea of}} the online double is {{historically}} contextualised and analysed. Beginning with the contemporary idea of the ‘selfie’ <b>as</b> online self-induced <b>double,</b> I proceed to discuss the Doppelgänger’s (double) mythical and literary roots, in order to expand the discussion of the selfie to include the online double. Two instances of the online double are unpacked, namely the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow and the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> a stand-in or alter-ego, which correspond significantly with Marshall McLuhan’s analysis of the Narcissus myth and technological use. McLuhan reveals the doubled nature of our technological engagement that leads to either self-amputation or self-amplification. In my analysis, the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow is correlated with self-amputation and the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> alterego with self-amplification. It is argued that the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow is evoked online through the mining of data regarding the self that is captured consciously and unconsciously to create {{what is known as the}} Data Doppelgänger. The figure of the Doppelgänger is further vividly conjured through virtual stand-ins or alter-egos that act on behalf of the self to create a tele-presence through examples such as Project Lifelike and rep. licants. org.
