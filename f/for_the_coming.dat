5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane.

After only a few second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer.

Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway.

From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea.

In 35games pitched for the Padres, he started six, had a 6–9record and a 3.40ERA in 90innings. On March18, 1964, it was announced that Sisler retired from baseball to join an Investment company.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, an October {{snowstorm}} in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tent—a special disaster because revivalists {{were typically}} paid with a freewill offering {{at the end}} of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold {{at the end of}} the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly.|$|E
