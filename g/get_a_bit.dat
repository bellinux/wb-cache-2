[...] "People <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> worried about me," [...] he told Cricinfo in 2008, [...] "Shane Warne's been a fine bowler—no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things—but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI —they only played against the best—had no rough to bowl at. I {{never had to}} bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Wii's release, players began {{incurring}} injuries {{while playing}} Wii Sports, among other games, when they accidentally hit other players or objects while swinging the Wii Remote. This string of accidents, and others related to players throwing the Wii Remote while playing Wii Sports, prompted Nintendo president Satoru Iwata {{to develop a}} campaign to reduce such incidents. In regard to the issue, Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa commented, [...] "People tended to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> excited, especially while playing Wii Sports, {{and in some cases}} the remote would come loose from their hands." [...] Nintendo responded by offering replacement Wii Remote wrist straps that were almost twice as thick. Other injuries include muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries from excess playing of simulated sports on the Wii—dubbed [...] "Wii-itis".|$|E

500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often {{suffered}} {{emotional abuse}} {{from her husband}} J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show. Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." [...] She also added, [...] "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end." [...] In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: [...] "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I still say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties." [...] The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented, ...|$|E

500|$|Paolini {{chose to}} have Eragon mature {{throughout}} the book because, [...] "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation {{throughout the book}} [...] "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities {{as a writer and}} as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book." [...] Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as [...] "the perfect friend" [...] by Paolini. He decided to go in a more [...] "human direction" [...] with her because she is raised away from her own species, in [...] "close mental contact" [...] with a human. [...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Andy Battaglia {{felt that}} [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] gave the album an [...] "opening charge {{by way of}} a raucous marching-band beat and panting {{attempts}} to squeeze a lot of words into closing musical corners". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as [...] "fantastic, legs-in-the-air". Paul Flynn of the same publication wrote that it [...] "further relegated the other members of Destiny's Child to the position of Beyoncé's backing singers". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media who complimented Jerkins's [...] "incredible" [...] drum programming and the [...] "mind-boggling" [...] backing track felt that it lacked a tune: [...] "The vocals are too breathy, too whiny, and too processed, and the song's one thrilling moment-- near the end, where the harmonies <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of room to play off each other with ABBA-esque rococo aplomb-- lasts only for a second." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols deemed its production [...] "nifty" [...] with a [...] "rat-a-tat drum line percussion propelling" [...] but felt that it contained a single hook expanded into an entire song. Lindsey Weber from Vulture criticized Williams' contribution to the bridge, describing it as [...] "weak".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of that happening again." ...|$|E

[...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds."

[...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat!

For The Game, Fincher employed a Technicolor printing process known as ENR which lent a smoother look to the night sequences.

John Harris of NME wrote that Siamese Dream, [...] "for all its air of non-committal blankness and exercise-book psychoanalysis, is a startling, deeply satisfying record". Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times predicted that [...] "the scale of its success will likely be tied to how many fans are willing to stop moshing and enter into some rather contemplative, even tender territory", and wrote that [...] "the songs tend to drift in places, and some <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> long-winded, but the overall balance between the harsh and the sweet makes for a strong and distinctive package".
