50|$|Eleazar {{lived through}} the period when, {{according}} to a younger contemporary, the performance of circumcision was punished by the Romans with the sword; {{the study of the}} Jewish law, with the stake; the celebration of Passover, with crucifixion; and the observance of the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Booths,</b> with the scourge (Mek. l.c. 6; Lev. R. xxxii. 1). Still, Eleazar faithfully adhered to the teachings of his religion. Once he was arrested and cast into prison, where he met Hananiah ben Teradion. He tried to instill hope into his fellow prisoner's breast, because there was only one charge against him, that of teaching the Law, while himself he considered lost, because there were five counts against him. Hananiah, on the contrary, thought that Eleazar's chances of escape were better than his own; and the sequel proved that he was right. Hananiah was condemned to a terrible death, while Eleazar was acquitted (Ab. Zarah 17b).|$|E

5000|$|The income {{derived from}} land unlawfully {{held by the}} possessor, {{for which he is}} {{answerable}} to the true owner when the latter recovers the land from him by the judgment of a court. The Talmud speaks of the possessor of land without right as the [...] "robber of the land" [...] (in English law, [...] "disseizor"); and he, or even a third person who takes fruits or branches from land thus withheld from the true owner, is considered as morally guilty of robbery (see the prohibition of an Israelite using, in the ritual thyrsus on the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Booths,</b> a palm-branch or citron taken from land held by a disseizor iv. 1, 2). The liability to pay mesne profits is implied and rather distantly indicated in the Mishnah (Giṭ. v. 2). Assuming that he who sells land with warranty is liable not only for the price of the land which he receives, but also for the mesne profits which the purchaser will have to pay after eviction to the true owner, it is here taught that from motives of public policy the warranty inserted in the deed of sale, though in the nature of a bond, is to be levied, as far as it secures the purchaser against this liability, only upon [...] "free property," [...] not on [...] "subjected property," [...] i.e., on lands which in the meanwhile have been given away, sold, or encumbered (for the distinction see Deed). The Gemara (B. M. 14a, b) discusses this matter fully {{in the light of the}} warranty, the liability of the unlawful possessor being taken for granted (see Maimonides, [...] "Yad," [...] Gezelah, ch. xiv.).|$|E
50|$|Right {{above the}} bunker, {{on the first}} floor of the building, stands sukkah, a fragile scaffold-like wooden {{construction}} with transparent paper inner walls. The outside of it is sheathed with black boards to resemble the woodshed of Lipke. In Judaism, sukkah is a temporary shelter whose religious significance is celebrated during Sukkot or the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Booths.</b> To Jews sukkah serves as a reminder of the tents and other fragile shelters of the ancient Israelites where they lived for forty years after God, with the help of Moses, had freed them from slavery in Egypt but had yet to bring them to the Promised Land. This joyful celebration takes place shortly after days of Yom-Kippur fasting and repentance. Sukkah is a temporary shelter, and as such it must be simple to build. The author of art conception of the Memorial, Viktors Jansons, has conceived of the sukkah as a symbolic double of the bunker, the temporary shelter that hangs in between the heaven and the earth. This tent stands for the fragility of life and its dependence on God, reminding that it is not the walls that provide security, it is the faith. On the thin walls of the sukkah artist Kristaps Ģelzis has drawn - with light strokes discernible only in good light - a landscape with a verdant valley at the height of the summer. This landscape that Ģelzis calls “a meditation” and be seen both as meditation on the Promised Land and a vision of a summer in the Latvian countryside before the war. It is nature in its primeval simplicity and beauty, an archetypical testimony to life, the source of life and constant rebirth. The drawing is dim and vague as an image that is stored only in memories, or the one that is conjured in one’s imagination by hope and longing for freedom.Above the sukkah on the attic level, there is an open hatch in the floor through which the lower two levels can be ob¬served. The authors of the memorial consider it essential for the visitor to look at the real shelter, the bunker, and the symbolic shelter, the sukkah, from above. First of all, it implies looking back at the past from a point in the future where one no longer can discern details but has gained a perspective on the bigger picture: interconnections, immutable values, the intransient. Second, it resembles looking from the vantage point of view, the one of a narrator or, figuratively speaking, God, for we know that the people who found shelter in the bunker survived the war whereas at the time, they could only hope for such an outcome.|$|E
