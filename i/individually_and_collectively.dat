25|$|About 10% of the {{population}} of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both <b>individually</b> <b>and</b> <b>collectively,</b> the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity - the Catholic Church and the Orange Order - served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share their vision of how the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the independent living movement, which emerged in California in the 1960s through the efforts of Edward Roberts and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, <b>individually</b> <b>and</b> <b>collectively,</b> in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the independent living movement's ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses). Similarly, The Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation. Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. Self-representation was much more difficult for those who could not articulate their thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.|$|E

25|$|The first {{international}} Baha'i Youth Conference held in Costa Rica came about in 1972 {{two days after}} the Managua earthquake. However a minibus full of young people came through Honduras with only minor difficulties and two Nicaraguan youth got through. Total attendance was about seventy-five. 1977 also saw the first time a Bahá'í float was entered in one of the annualfestivals in Santa Cruz. A larger conference of about 200 gathered in January 1978. Some of the attendees, together with various adults, then took a trip into Guanacaste province where over a short time 14 new assemblies were founded and then they extended work into Meseta province (see San Ramón for mention of this remote province) where several groups were re-contacted and a new assembly elected. In 1983 the Universal House of Justice recognized the twin youth conferences of Honduras and Costa Rica held in early March - a challenge representing a substantial {{increase in the number of}} youth Bahá'ís - and called on them to consider the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá in civilizing influences they should undertake <b>individually</b> <b>and</b> <b>collectively.</b> In the fall of 1984 a permanent site for the National Youth Institute was chosen and plans were developed for it to serve as a center for the arts and performance, agriculture and outreach programs.

500|$|Wanderers {{took the}} lead fifteen minutes into the game when Betts opened the scoring from an acute angle after Robert Vidal's long dribble.

After twenty minutes Alcock put the ball past the Engineers' goalkeeper, William Merriman, but the goal was disallowed because Charles Wollaston had handled the ball. Wanderers continued to exert further pressure on the Engineers' goal and only Merriman's skill was able to prevent them from increasing their lead. [...] One newspaper later described his performance as [...] "perfect". Despite a late rally from the Engineers, Wanderers were able to hold on to their lead and the game ended in a 1–0 victory.

He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury {{he was able to}} play in the next match, a 2–0 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was taking time to gel, saying [...] "We've all played at a high standard, <b>individually</b> <b>and</b> <b>collectively</b> we are good, but there's something missing. I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes." [...] His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot at Kettering Town in a 2–0 victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said [...] "It was a good finish by Duane, he does it in training quite often". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle.

40|$|Online {{learning}} {{has become a}} conventional term and practice in Australian higher education, yet cultural inclusivity for Indigenous* students is insufficiently reflected in Learning Management System policies and design. This study aims to explore culturally inclusive learning entrenched in Australian university policies on and practices of Learning Management Systems (LMS) by applying Indigenous holistic pedagogical values in LMS design. Based on a literature review, we articulate four dimensions: communication, collaboration, community, and interculturality for culturally inclusive learning in an online learning environment. By using the dimensions, we critically review policies (n= 10) and LMS sites (n= 50). In this review, we argue that there are contrasts of <b>individually</b> heterogeneous <b>and</b> <b>collectively</b> homogeneous approaches, self-focused and community-driven pedagogy, and task-oriented and relational learning. Significantly, the review results indicate that Indigenous holistic pedagogies have a metaphysical strength to be the ontological foundation for cultural inclusivity. * Indigenous {{for the purposes of}} this paper refers to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </i...|$|R

I first discuss moral integrity, which recommends congruence between one's actions and positions at the personal and political levels. Second, I draw on a Confucian, relational conception of persons to offer a critique of the collective action/tragedy of the commons framework itself.
