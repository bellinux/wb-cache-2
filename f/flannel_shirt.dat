I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a <b>flannel</b> <b>shirt</b> and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

500|$|There are two {{accompanying}} {{music videos}} for [...] "Why". The original video, directed by Im Seong-gwan, premiered simultaneously {{with the release}} of the single. Its synopsis follows the lyrical content of the song, depicting Taeyeon as the protagonist who desires to escape a suffocating life to re-energize herself. The filming location was decided by Taeyeon herself to be California; the singer explained on Pops of Seoul, [...] "I wanted to choose a location where I had created wonderful memories before. When it comes to a liberal, cool, sunny and beautiful place, LA comes to mind first, and that's why." [...] Jeff Benjamin from Fuse wrote that the video [...] "showcases a new side of Taeyeon" [...] while praising the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] fashion style, notably Moschino crop tops and a <b>flannel</b> <b>shirt</b> plastered with the phrase [...] "Queen of Beers."

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was shot on September 26–28, 2011, in County Down, Northern Ireland. It was filmed {{in a field}} {{in the town of}} Bangor, County Down, ahead of Rihanna's embarkment on the European leg of the Loud Tour (2011), and the New Lodge area of North Belfast.

[...] "Sometimes she’ll just be in a plaid <b>flannel</b> <b>shirt</b> because she’s painting. Some days she’ll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt.
