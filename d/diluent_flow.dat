40|$|In {{the process}} of {{removing}} cryoprotectants from cryopreserved blood, the theoretically optimal operating condition, {{which is based on}} the assumption that the distribution of red blood cells is uniform, is often used to reduce or even avoid the hypotonic damage to cells. However, due to the polydispersity of cells, the optimal condition is actually not reliable. In this study, based on the discrete concept developed in our previous work, the effect of the polydispersity on the recovery rate of cells in the dilution-filtration system was statistically investigated by assigning three random parameters, isotonic cell volume, cell surface area, and osmotically inactive cell volume, to cells in small units of blood. The results show that, due to the polydispersity, the real recovery rate deviates from the ideal value that is based on uniform distribution. The deviation significantly increases with the standard errors of cell parameters, and it can be also magnified by high cryoprotectant concentrations. Under the effect of polydispersity, the uniform distribution-based optimized blood or <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> rate is not perfect. In practice, one should adopt a more conservative blood or <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> rate so that the hypotonic damage to cells can be further reduced...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of gas analysis, most of the {{attention}} during the past quarter was devoted to gaining an understanding of the operation of the Antek total sulfur analyzer, and making appropriate modifications in the unit. The primary problem is that the resistance of the capillary flow restrictor is not large enough, and the amount of sulfur which reaches the UV-analyzer results in the analyzer becoming saturated. We have added a N{sub 2 } <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> downstream of the pyrotube tube which, we believe, will permit the unit to be operated at pressures to about 50 psig. Use of larger <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> rates to permit higher pressure operation is not feasible since larger diluent rates increase the back pressure on the quartz pyrotube (which operates at 1050 {degrees}C) to unsafe levels. In the meantime, Antek is studying the redesign of the capillary flow restrictor to provide larger flow resistance. Studies on the regeneration of FeS in the atmospheric pressure reactor were almost completed during the quarter. Only a series of multicycle sulfidation-regeneration tests remains. The effects of reactive gas mol fraction and temperature have been examined using both O{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O/N{sub 2 } atmospheres. The initial rate of regeneration was found to be a weak function of temperature and first-order in both O{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O concentration. In a test series in which the reactive gas contained both O{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O, the experimental initial rate was effectively equal to the sum of the individual initial rates, suggesting that the two reactions proceed independently of one another. Detailed correlation and statistical analysis of the data is currently being done. Principal effort during the quarter using the high pressure electrobalance was devoted to studying the regeneration of FeS in a H{sub 2 }O/N{sub 2 } atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of the hydrogen flame lonization detector to trace quantities of methane, with several flame diluents (e. g., carrier gas), has been re-examined. The effects of the dilu-ents CO 2, N 2, Ar, Ne, He, Kr and Xe on the response {{over a wide range}} of hydrogen and <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> rates were investi-gated. An indirect method used for Kr and Xe gave values for the flow rates at maximum responses but did not permit the measurement of absolute responses. From the data, relation-ships were sought between the thermal properties of the diluent gases and their flow rates at the conditions of maxi-mum response. The order of the flow rates at the maximum response was He) > Ne^> Ar} Kr} Xe) > N 2 "> C 0 2. This order can be related to the thermal properties of the diluents. The responses depended on the flame composition, especially the nature and proportion of the diluent, and a constant flame temperature is implied for all diluents under maximum res-ponse conditions...|$|E
40|$|A plasma {{polymerization}} {{process for}} the deposition of a dielectric polymer coating on a substrate comprising disposing of the substrate in a closed reactor between two temperature controlled electrodes connected to a power supply is presented. A vacuum is maintained within the closed reactor, causing a monomer gas or gas mixture of a monomer and <b>diluent</b> to <b>flow</b> into the reactor, generating a plasma between the electrodes. The vacuum varies and controls the dielectric constant of the polymer coating being deposited by regulating the gas total and partial pressure, the electric field strength and frequency, and the current density...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} {{by the water}} gas shift reaction (WGSR) is equilibrium limited due to thermodynamic constrains. However, this can be overcome by continuously removing the product CO{sub 2 }, thereby driving the WGSR in the forward direction to enhance hydrogen production. This project aims at using a high reactivity, mesoporous calcium based sorbent (PCC-CaO) for removing CO{sub 2 } using reactive separation scheme. Preliminary results have shown that PCC-CaO dominates in its performance over naturally occurring limestone towards enhanced hydrogen production. However, maintenance of high reactivity of the sorbent over several reaction-regeneration cycles warrants effective regeneration methods. We have identified sub-atmospheric calcination (vacuum) as vital regeneration technique that helps preserve the sorbent morphology. Sub-atmospheric calcination studies reveal the significance of vacuum level, <b>diluent</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate, thermal properties of diluent gas, and sorbent loading on the kinetics of calcination and the morphology of the resultant CaO sorbent. Steam, which can be easily separated from CO{sub 2 }, has been envisioned as a potential diluent gas due to its better thermal properties resulting in effective heat transfer. A novel multi-fixed bed reactor was designed which isolates the catalyst bed from the sorbent bed during the calcination step. This should prevent any potential catalyst deactivation due to oxidation by CO{sub 2 } during the regeneration phase...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} from coal gasification {{can be enhanced}} by driving the equilibrium limited Water Gas Shift reaction forward by incessantly removing the CO{sub 2 } by-product via the carbonation of calcium oxide. This project aims at using the OSU patented high-reactivity mesoporous precipitated calcium carbonate sorbent for removing the CO{sub 2 } product. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the show the superior performance of the PCC sorbent over other naturally occurring calcium sorbents. Gas composition analyses show the formation of 100 % pure hydrogen. Novel calcination techniques could lead to smaller reactor footprint and single-stage reactors that can achieve maximum theoretical H{sub 2 } production for multicyclic applications. Sub-atmospheric calcination studies reveal the effect of vacuum level, <b>diluent</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate, thermal properties of the diluent gas and the sorbent loading on the calcination kinetics which {{play an important role}} on the sorbent morphology. Steam, which can be easily separated from CO{sub 2 }, is envisioned to be a potential diluent gas due to its enhanced thermal properties. Steam calcination studies at 700 - 850 C reveal improved sorbent morphology over regular nitrogen calcination. A mixture of 80 % steam and 20 % CO{sub 2 } at ambient pressure was used to calcine the spent sorbent at 820 C thus lowering the calcination temperature. Regeneration of calcium sulfide to calcium carbonate was achieved by carbonating the calcium sulfide slurry by bubbling CO{sub 2 } gas at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) on minimum {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of desflurane were studied. For that purpose, 30 dogs were randomly allocated into two groups: desflurane group (GD) and N 2 O and desflurane group (GDN). GD animals received propofol to intubation, and 11. 5 V% of desflurane diluted in 100 % O 2. After 30 minutes, they received electric stimulus {{and if the}} animal did not react to stimulus, desflurane concentration was reduced by 1. 5 V%. This protocol was repeated at each 15 minutes, and stimulus was interrupted when voluntary reaction was observed. GDN dogs were submitted to <b>diluent</b> <b>flow</b> 30 % O 2 and 70 % N 2 O. Desflurane's MAC; heart (HR) and respiratory (RR) rates; systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (SAP, DAP, and MAP, respectively); end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2); oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO 2) and body temperature (T) were evaluated. In both groups increase in HR and ETCO 2, and decrease in RR and T were associated with administration of the highest dose of desflurane. Blood pressures decreased 30 minutes after desflurane administration in GDN, and after this measurement the values increased. Reduction in desflurane's MAC was observed as well. It is concluded that N 2 O associated with desflurane reduced desflurane's MAC by 16 % with increase in HR and respiratory depression...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop a novel multifunctional co-processed diluent consisting of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 102), crospovidone (Polyplasdone XL) and polyethylene glycol 4000. Colloidal silicon dioxide and talc were also incorporated as minor components in the diluent to improve tableting properties. Melt granulation was adopted for preparation of co-processed diluent. Percentage of Avicel PH 102, Polyplasdone XL and polyethylene glycol 4000 were selected as independent variables and disintegration time was chosen as a dependent variable in simplex lattice design. The co-processed diluent was characterised for angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, Carr′s index, percentage of fines and dilution potential study. Acetaminophen and metformin were used as poorly compressible model drugs for preparation of tablets. The blend of granules of drug and extra-granular co-processed <b>diluent</b> exhibited better <b>flow</b> as compared to the blend of drug granules and physical mixture of diluents blend. The diluent exhibited satisfactory tableting properties. The tablets exhibited fairly rapid drug release. In conclusion, melt granulation is proposed as a method of preparing co-processed diluent. The concept can be used to bypass patents on excipient manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|The <b>flow</b> of a <b>diluent</b> gas {{supplied}} to a motoring engine was controlled at a diluent to {{air mass flow}} ratios of 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, and 70 %. This arrangement was a significant set up for running the engine in the Low-Temperature Combustion mode. The engine used was a 436 cc Yanmar Diesel engine, driven at constant 2200 rpm by a 10 hp AC powered dynamometer. Intake air flow was measured by a model FMA- 903 -V Air Velocity Transducer by Omega Engineering, Inc., and the <b>diluent</b> gas <b>flow</b> was both measured and controlled by a model FMA- 2613 A Mass Flow Controller, also by Omega Engineering, Inc. Both were connected to a computer through a National Instruments USB- 6211 data acquisition hub, and the signals from both were processed in real time through National Instruments' LabView 8. 2 software. The diluent gas used was nitrogen. The flow controller {{was found to have}} reasonable flow precision but poor flow accuracy at many of the flow rates encountered during this experiment, with a minimum steady state error of 3. 7 % for a flow rate of 207. 4 Standard Liters Per Minute (SLPM), the highest flow studied, and a maximum error of 97. 4 % at 53. 8 SLPM, the lowest flow studied. (cont.) The substantial error at low flow rates stems from the rated lower flow limit of the controller of 250 SLPM. A relation describing the amount of steady state error present was determined empirically, and either this equation or the implementation of an external PI controller can be used in the controlling LabView environment to decrease the steady state error. by David M.

40|$|Epstein–Barr virus-induced {{molecule}} 1 ligand chemokine (CCL 19) is a CC chemokine that chemoattracts both dendritic cells (DC) and T lymphocytes. We {{evaluated the}} antitumour efficacy of CCL 19 in a murine model of spontaneous bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. These transgenic mice (CC- 10 TAg) express the SV 40 large T antigen under the Clara Cell promoter, develop bilateral, multifocal, pulmonary carcinomas and die at 4 months owing to progressive pulmonary tumour burden. To mimic therapy in late-stage disease, 3 -month-old transgenic mice {{were treated with}} recombinant CCL 19 (0. 5 [*]μg[*]dose− 1) by intranodal (axillary lymph node region) injection three times per week for 4 weeks. CCL 19 treatment led to a marked reduction in tumour burden with extensive mononuclear infiltration of the tumours compared to <b>diluent</b> treated controls. <b>Flow</b> cytometric analyses showed significant increases in CD 4 and CD 8 T cell subsets as well as DC in the lungs of CCL 19 -treated mice. Lung tissue cytokine profiles showed a shift towards immune stimulatory molecules with {{a decrease in the}} immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-β. Our findings show that CCL 19 may serve as a potential immune stimulator and provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of CCL 19 in cancer immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Historically, odor {{emission}} monitoring of high density livestock operations {{has been limited}} to direct, whole-air assessment utilizing remote site sampling by plastic bags, human sensory panelists and dynamic dilution olfactometry. On-going efforts by these authors are directed at enabling the translation of these sensory ‘only’ monitoring protocols to instrument ‘primarily, with sensory oversight’ alternatives. This current work attempts to address the latter requirement for sensory oversight and the associated need for improved methods of remote site whole-air sample collection. Published works by these authors {{as well as others}} places in serious question the appropriateness of the use of plastic bags for the challenge of CAFO odor assessment; especially relative to sample points at increasing downwind distance from the source. Concerns increase due to the associated natural dilution effects relative to priority semi-volatile odorants. This current submission reports on the progress to date in the development and evaluation of alternative whole-air sampling strategies which attempt to address the primary limitation of plastic sampling bags; the adsorption loss-to-wall of high impact semi-volatile odorants such as p-cresol. In this approach the actual field air sampling is carried out utilizing sorbent tubes for on-site collection of the volatiles/odorants from a measured volume of air. These sorbent tube collections are then transported to the laboratory for reconstitution within a heat traced, passivated and piston-displaced vessel prior to composite odor assessment. The sample reconstitution process is accomplished simply by thermally desorbing the collected odorants into a <b>flowing</b> <b>diluent</b> gas stream and making up to final volume to yield a match of the originally sampled environment...|$|R
