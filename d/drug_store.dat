This allowed Combs, a Democrat, to secure the position.|$|E

5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office.

In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his hand as if he were heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause.
