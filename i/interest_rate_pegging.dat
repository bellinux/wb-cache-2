40|$|In {{this article}} we reexamine a famous result by Sargent and Wallace (1975) {{according}} to which a "pure interest rate peg" leads to nominal price indeterminacy. We use Weil's (1991) generalization of the Sidrauski-Brock model, where arrival of new "generations" of infinitely lived agents is allowed, and we obtain the following results: (i) nominal indeterminacy holds in the traditional Sidrauski-Brock framework; (ii) This nominal indeterminacy disappears as soon as new generations arrive in time, via some rigorous version of Patinkin's "real balance effect"; (iii) A multiplicity of solutions may still remain, but full determinacy occurs in some cases, depending notably on fiscal policy or the distribution of endowments in time.

In such an economy, we ask the question of how the monetary authority operates when it aims to maximize total welfare. We find that optimal monetary policy has the novel role of sharing the financial market risk traders face, among all agents in the economy. This finding holds for any concave utility function and is not sensitive to the degree of market segmentation. When risk is shared perfectly in this way, consumption is equalized between the two groups, and agents, if given the choice, would be indifferent between participating or not in the financial markets. We also explore the implications that this policy has for the volatility of stock prices and of inflation, when compared to the policies of constant money supply, inflation targeting and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pegging.</b> We find that optimal monetary policy is not necessarily associated either with minimal stock price volatility or with minimal inflation volatility...|$|E
40|$|Most {{prices and}} {{interest}} rates display fluctuating levels that embody extractable energy and equivalent amounts of money. Such fluctuations are also associated {{with varying degrees of}} uncertainty. Shannon's derivations of spectral entropy and information content offer computational techniques for unraveling the portion of useful economies that is resident in such cycles that nevertheless goes unaccounted for as a significant source of missing data in the composition of the overall economy. Shannon's concept of spectral entropy can also be exploited to quantify the amount of uncertainty that would preside over expectations, either adaptive or rational. Apart from Clausius-type and Boltzmannian derivations, Shannon's derivation of entropy which follows Boltzmann's lead, can be applied to price and rate fluctuations, thus unraveling a higher order generator mechanism for cost pressure and inflation.

40|$|I {{examine the}} postulates of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) under a nominal {{interest}} rate peg. First, I show that the usual definition of a non-Ricardian plan involves a number of government's non-credible policy commitments, thus confuting {{the interpretation of the}} FTPL as a policy-based equilibrium selection device. The main novelty of this criticism is that {{it is based on the}} same core assumptions maintained by this theory: there is a positive stock of governmentissued assets at the beginning of the history owned by the households, flow of funds constraints must be respected in every contingency, although transversality conditions may be violated at off-equilibrium prices. Then I investigate some additional necessary conditions that allow the government to implement non-Ricardian fiscal plans that result in a unique equilibrium under an interest rate peg. A critical necessary condition for the credibility of such a fiscalist plan is that the equilibrium level of seigniorage must be non-positive. I argue that the fiscalist stock-analogy, under this monetary rule, is only meaningful, precisely, when money enters into the government constraint as a destination of funds, rather than as a source. fiscal-monetary interactions, fiscal theory of the price level, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pegging,</b> government commitment...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the determinacy of the equilibrium price {{level in the}} cash-in-advance monetary economy of Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1987), {{in the case of}} deterministic âfundamentalsâ. The possibilities both of a multiplicity of perfect foresight equilibria and of âsunspot equilibriaâ are considered. Two types of monetary policy regimes are considered and compared, one in which the money supply grows at a given exogenous rate (that may be positive or negative), and one in which the nominal interest rate on one-period government debt is pegged at a given non-negative level. In the case of constant money growth rate regimes, it is shown that one can easily have both indeterminacy of perfect foresight equilibrium and existence of sunspot equilibria; indeed, in the case of negative rates of money growth (as called for by Friedman (1969)), both types of indeterminacy necessarily occur. On the other hand, sufficient conditions for uniqueness of equilibrium (and non-existence of equilibria other than a deterministic steady state) are also given, and a class of cases is identified in which a sufficiently high rate of money growth guarantees this. Thus there may be a conflict between the aims of choosing a rate of money growth that results in a high level of welfare in the steady state equilibrium and choosing a rate that makes this steady state the unique equilibrium.) In the case of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pegging</b> regimes, sufficient conditions are given for uniqueness of equilibrium (and impossibility of sunspot equilibria), and it is shown that these necessarily hold in the case of any low enough nominal interest rate. Thus the nominal interest rate peg allows simultaneous achievement of price level determinacy and a high level of welfare in the unique (steady state) equilibrium. In this paper I consider the consequences of alternative choices of the monetary policy regime for the determinacy of the rational expectations equilibrium value of money, and in particular for the existence or not of âsunspotâ equilibria, i. e., rational expectations equilibria in which fluctuations in the price level occur in response to random events that represent no change in economic âfundamentalsâ, simply due to self-fulfilling revisions of people's expectations. I am interested in particular in making the point that a consideration of the complete set of possible equilibria associated with a given policy regime may alter one's evaluation of the relative desirability of alternative policies, relative to the conclusion that one might reach if one considered only a single possible equilibrium associated with each policy regime (perhaps a unique equilibrium involving a âminimum set of state variablesâ). In view of this I give particular attention to policy regimes of types that have sometimes been advocated as ways of reducing the inefficiency associated with a rate of return differential between money and other financial assets, and show that policies that might otherwise be desirable (policies that make possible a more desirable equilibrium than would otherwise be possible) can have the unfortunate consequence of rendering equilibrium indeterminate and making possible equilibrium fluctuations in response to âsunspotâ events...|$|E

The government is able to rule out most prices using strategically its fiscal instruments, undercutting the private-market price whenever it is inconsistent with the fiscal targets. In {{the spirit of the}} FTPL, along the fiscal strategies of this paper the government does not follow a rule that mechanically links the fiscal surplus to the real value of its outstanding nominal debt. Like in the monetarist paradigm, the fiscal authority is forced to blink in face of an independent monetary policy, although in equilibrium the former achieves its own targets.

40|$|This {{paper has}} three objectives. First, {{it aims to}} reveal the logic of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{settings}} pursued by the monetary authorities of twelve new EU members.

Countries with fixed exchange rates seem to apply an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>peg</b> with the euro. Second, it sheds light on the inflation processes of these countries. To this end, we estimate an open economy Phillips curve (PC) and find that inflation rates are not only driven by backward persistency, but also have a forward-looking component. Finally, we assess the viability of existing monetary arrangements for price stability, using the conditional inflation variance obtained from a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity estimation of the PC.
