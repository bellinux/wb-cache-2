5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep <b>geothermal</b> <b>well</b> was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{becoming}} {{an important source of}} energy and its importance will be increasing in the future. When we drill <b>geothermal</b> <b>wells,</b> we encounter high temperature zones and may also encounter high pressure areas.

The survey that was sent to High-Pressure-High-Temperature (HPHT) professionals at the HPHT Summit meeting in 2012, showed Cement Design {{is one of the biggest}} concerns for HPHT operations and it is one of their technology gaps. Temperatures as high as 200 °C- 400 °C could destabilize the setting of the cement. If the well has both high temperature and high pressure, the cementing process becomes much more complex.
