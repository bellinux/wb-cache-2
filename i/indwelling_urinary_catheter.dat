50|$|Foley first {{described}} {{the use of}} a self-retaining balloon catheter in 1929, to be used to achieve haemostasis after cystoscopic prostatectomy. He worked on development of this design for use as an <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheter,</b> to provide continuous drainage of the bladder, in the 1930s. His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without external taping or strapping. He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935, and published a paper describing it in 1937.While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals. Raiche appealed this decision in court, and it was overturned, returning the patent to Raiche. A further request for a hearing made by Foley was refused, and so the patent stayed with Raiche.|$|E
40|$|Background: Care for {{patients}} with <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheter</b> {{is one of the}} most important factors in preventing problems associated with indwelling urinary catheters. Caregiver education about caring of indwelling urinary catheters is important the same as patient education to prevent urinary catheters problems.

In 34 patients (24 %), no clear reason for catheterisation prior to admission could be identified. In 46 patients (32 %) catheterisation was performed for severe uncontrollable incontinence. In all, 66 patients had their <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheter</b> removed at some stage. Of these a total of 49 patients were continent 15 days after the removal of the catheter, 33 patients were still continent after 3 months and 29 patients remained continent after one year.

In conclusion, attempts should be made to use long term indwelling urinary catheterisation only if other measures fail.

This randomised control study recruited 66 subjects with <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> after undergoing CRC surgery who later underwent catheter removal.

Systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, LUTS, and QoL satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three groups. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender or vehicle.

SETTING: A purposeful sampling strategy was used to identify a diverse sample of 28 Connecticut NHs, {{defined in terms of}} ownership, quality ratings, and bed size. PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay (3 Ì†e 100 days) residents of study NHs with an <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheter</b> present at any time over a 1 -year period.

40|$|Prevention of <b>catheter</b> {{associated}} <b>urinary</b> tract infections (CAUTIs) is {{an important}} component of the delivery of safe quality care. A common theme is emerging from the literature: not all <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> are appropriate for the duration of the catheterization, which places the patient at an increased risk of CAUTI (Blodgett, 2009). Often, the reasoning used for determining if a patient needs a catheter is not evidence-based. The placement and maintenance of <b>indwelling</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> (IUCs) are in the scope of practice for registered nurses. Nurses should play an integral role in developing strategies to limit the use of catheters thereby reducing the incidence of CAUTIs. The purpose of the pilot study is to describe registered nurses 2 Ì† 7 practice and perceptions of IUCs and the actual number of days patients have IUCs. A convenience sample of fifty registered nurses 2 Ì† 7 perceptions of <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> was measured with an instrument developed for use in this study. The Likert scale was used for the instrument design (Burns 2 Ì† 6 Grove, 2005). The instrument addressed both agreement and frequency, and was measured using a five-point scale.
