40|$|Abstract. Investment casting {{is one of}} main {{precision}} casting {{processes to}} realize near net shape castings. For the castings with thin-walled cross section or complicated shape, {{it is easy to}} generate casting stress such as thermal stress, mechanical stress and phase transformation stress, resulting in casting deformation due to the uneven cooling and <b>hindered</b> <b>contraction.</b> Once three-dimensional deformation is formed, {{it is very hard to}} correct. In this paper the finite element method (FEM) was used to analyze the stress and deformation of thin-walled lost wax casting. The results show that the temperature and stress distributions are uneven in the casting and the tendency to deform is higher even with insulating shell mold. And based on the results, the technical measures of adding supporting ribs are adopted to restrain deformation. The practice of volume production indicates that no casting was rejected due to deformation defects...|$|E
30|$|This overall {{behavior}} {{is a consequence}} of several features of concrete mechanics such as micro-cracking produced by <b>hindered</b> volume <b>contraction,</b> its nonlinear compressive stress–strain behavior with concrete softening and its low tensile strength. In particular the effect of the concrete micro-cracking has been proven to {{have a significant effect on}} the dynamic behaviour of PRC beams with varying prestressing forces.|$|R

40|$|Zeolites {{with the}} CHA {{topology}} have been synthesized with Si/Al ratios ranging from 15 to 133. ICP-AES analysis {{shows that the}} Si/Al ratio in the material is close to linearly related to the Si/Al ratio in the reaction mixture, while powder XRD shows that the unit cell parameters decrease with increasing Si/Al ratio. The difference between the unit cell parameters for the as-synthesized and the calcined samples show that the structure directing agent sterically <b>hinders</b> the <b>contraction</b> in the c-axis direction for the as-synthesized samples. A relationship between the Si/Al ratio in the material and the a-axis has been established. The particle size of the material also shows a dependency on the Si/Al ratio of the material...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of sacral roots for electrodefecation results in simultaneous {{activation of the}} rectum and the external anal sphincter. The sphincter <b>contraction</b> <b>hinders</b> evacuation of the rectum. In this study anodal blocking {{has been used to}} reduce the activation of the external anal sphincter. Using a tripolar cuff electrode and monophasic rectangular current pulses in 7 acute minipigs experiments the pressure response in the anal canal was reduced more than 80 % in all animals compared to stimulation without blocking. The result confirms previous results from the bladder, in other species, in that selective small fibre activation can be obtained using an anodal block...|$|R
40|$|Anesthetic {{management}} of a parturient with respiratory failure associated with hemoptysis,dyspnea, and orthopnea is difficult. An anesthesiologist {{should realize that}} the patient'smajor problem is not solved during the surgery. This circumstance {{is similar to a}} patientwith associated cardiac disease scheduled for non-cardiac surgery. General anesthesia withendotracheal intubation can provide safe oxygenation for both the parturient and the fetus,but with possible unexpected massive hemoptysis and tumor seeding. Prolonged intubationmay delay the patient's pulmonary treatment course. Laryngeal mask anesthesia can providean airway, but must not be secured due to the risk of aspiration. The need of high doses ofinhalation drugs may <b>hinder</b> uterine <b>contractions.</b> The addition of a muscle relaxant willchange the patient's respiratory patterns and physiology. Regional anesthesia alone mightnot be tolerated. A decrease in cough strength, as well as dyspnea, orthopnea, and hyperventilationmay be harmful to both the parturient and the fetus. However, we successfullymanaged this case using epidural anesthesia combined with assisted mask ventilation insteadof spontaneous breathing usually provided by a simple mask in almost all American Societyof Anesthesiology (ASA) class I-II parturients during cesarean section. The anesthetic levelwas maintained at T 8 with 18 ml of 2 % Xylocaine mixed with 2 ml of 7 % sodium bicarbonatewith 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine epidurally and with the patient in a supine position with thehead up at 30 o to prevent cephalic spreading and to ensure better pulmonary ventilation...|$|R
40|$|The {{prostaglandin}} F 2 α (PGF 2 α) receptor (FP) {{is a key}} regulator of parturition and {{a target}} for pharmacological management of preterm labor. However, an incomplete understanding of signaling pathways regulating myometrial <b>contraction</b> <b>hinders</b> the development of improved therapeutics. Here we used a peptidomimetic inhibitor of parturition in mice, PDC 113. 824, whose structure {{was based on the}} NH 2 -terminal region of the second extracellular loop of FP receptor, to gain mechanistic insight underlying FP receptor-mediated cell responses in the context of parturition. We show that PDC 113. 824 not only delayed normal parturition in mice but also that it inhibited both PGF 2 α- and lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm labor. PDC 113. 824 inhibited PGF 2 α-mediated, Gα 12 -dependent activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathways, actin remodeling, and contraction of human myometrial cells likely by acting as a non-competitive, allosteric modulator of PGF 2 α binding. In contrast to its negative allosteric modulating effects on Rho/ROCK signaling, PDC 113. 824 acted as a positive allosteric modulator on PGF 2 α-mediated protein kinase C and ERK 1 / 2 signaling. This bias in receptor-dependent signaling was explained by an increase in FP receptor coupling to Gαq, at the expense of coupling to Gα 12. Our findings regarding the allosteric and biased nature of PDC 113. 824 offer new mechanistic insights into FP receptor signaling relevant to parturition and suggest novel therapeutic opportunities for the development of new tocolytic drugs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{thin sheet}} clamped at {{opposite}} ends and stretched develops wrinkles parallel to {{the direction of the}} applied tensile strain due to the <b>hindered</b> Poisson lateral <b>contraction</b> at the clamps. To study this phenomenon, a variational model recently proposed by Puntel, Deseri and Fried is adopted. The relevant energy functional includes bending and membranal contributions and is minimized subject to a constraint on the area of the mid-surface of the sheet. A fourth order partial-differential equation is henceforth obtained and numerically implemented using B-splines. Predictions are obtained concerning the number of wrinkles, critical applied stretches, and scaling relationships for wrinkle amplitude and wavelength. Both a linearized version of the boundary-value problem based on the small-slope approximation and a fully nonlinear one are considered: their results are found to be in good agreement for the whole range of applied stretches taken into account. Comparisons with previous analytical results by Puntel, Deseri and Fried, who used different boundary conditions and an Ansatz on the deflection function are also provided. The numerical results substantially confirm the validity of the analytical predictions. The present work provides then an alternative numerical method for the study of wrinkling in thin sheets and supports the use of analytical and semi-analytical solutions as viable options for specific geometries. Though further investigation, particularly experimental, is still needed, extensive comparisons of the results with other studies available in the literature provide confirmation for the scaling laws and signal that predicted values of the critical stretches may only be accurate for higher length-to-width aspect ratios...|$|R
