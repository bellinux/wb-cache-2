50|$|Britain had {{successfully}} tested a new HAA gun, 3.6-inch, in 1918. In 1928 3.7-inch became the preferred solution, {{but it took}} 6 years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) began in 1937; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At {{the same time the}} Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness. In 1939 a Machine <b>Fuse</b> <b>Setter</b> was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting.|$|E

On a single enclosed mount, he sits below and just outboard of the Pointer's seat. Under the Pointer's seat, {{and in front}} the <b>Fuse</b> <b>Setter,</b> is the Fuse Indicator Regulator. (pictured) It is a box with a window, a hand crank, and a selector lever. On a twin mount, he and his Fuze Indicator Regulator sit next to the Sight Setter between the guns. When the mount is put in Automatic control, he flips the selector lever to Auto, and this electrically powered Fuze Indicator Regulator automatically follows the fuze setting orders sent from the Fire Control System by synchro. In Local Control, he follows the Mount Captain's fuze orders by spinning the hand crank until the dials in the window read the correct fuze time.|$|E
