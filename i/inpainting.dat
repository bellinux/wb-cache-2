2500|$|One {{of the key}} {{principles}} of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated {{by the fact that}} in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification, video and audio processing. Sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression, image fusion and <b>inpainting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three main {{groups of}} 2D image <b>inpainting</b> {{algorithms}} {{can be found}} in literature. The first one to be noted is structural <b>inpainting,</b> the second one is texture <b>inpainting</b> and the last one is a combination of these two techniques. All these <b>inpainting</b> methods {{have one thing in common}} - they use the information of the known or undestroyed image areas in order to fill the gap.|$|E

50|$|Combined {{structural}} and textural <b>inpainting</b> approaches simultaneously try to perform texture and structure filling in regions of missing image information.Most parts {{of an image}} consist of texture and structure. The boundaries between image regions accumulate structural information which is a complex phenomenon. This is the result when blending different textures together. That is why, {{the state of the}} art <b>inpainting</b> method attempts to combine {{structural and}} textural <b>inpainting.</b>|$|E

30|$|Hidden view {{generation}} Recover {{a hidden}} {{background in the}} ROI based on background observation for see-through or generate plausible images for <b>inpaint.</b> In see-through, image-based methods are preferred for seamless real–virtual composition. Homography transformations of images [13, 19, 35, 36, 41, 42], rendering texture 3 D models [6, 31, 43], rendering voxels [37], and image-based rendering (IBR) [25, 26, 30, 44] are the major approaches. In <b>inpaint,</b> pixels or image patches are synthesized in the ROI {{to fill in the}} region with plausible pixels [9, 10, 21, 38].|$|R
50|$|Model based <b>inpainting</b> {{follows the}} Bayesian {{approach}} for which missing information is best fitted or estimated from {{the combination of}} the models of the underlying images as well as the image data actually being observed. In deterministic language, this has led to various variational <b>inpainting</b> models.|$|E

50|$|Like {{everything}} else the structural <b>inpainting</b> methods have both advantages and disadvantages. The {{main problem is}} that all the structural <b>inpainting</b> methods are not able to restore texture. Texture has a repetitive pattern which means that a missing portion cannot be restored by continuing the level lines into the gap.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inpaint</b> {{focuses on}} photo editing via {{simplified}} semi-automatic tools and mechanisms. The program includes a tool {{similar to the}} Healing Brush tool in Adobe Photoshop CS5 with the Content-Aware mode on. Just like Healing Brush, the tool tries to replace bad or damaged texture with good texture from another area to create a seamless repair of an image.|$|R

30|$|The {{observation}} methods described so far {{can be used}} together. For example, we can {{implement a}} method that removes an object on a plane with an observation-type method and fills the remaining regions with an <b>inpaint</b> method. We can use the current images fetched from a real-time observation-type method to map them on the scene geometry estimated using a pre-observation-type method. This approach will reduce the geometric and photometric inconsistencies.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the wide}} {{applications}} of digital camera and the digitalization of old photos, <b>inpainting</b> {{has become an}} automatic process that is performed on digital images. More than scratch removing, the <b>inpainting</b> techniques are also applied to object removal, text removal and other automatic modifications of images and videos.

Based on a superpixel oversegmentation of both the original and synthesized views, the proposed approach efficiently deals with many occlusion situations where most of previous approaches fail. The use of superpixels makes the algorithm more robust to inaccurate depth maps, while giving {{an efficient way to}} model the image. Extensive comparisons to relevant state-of-the-art methods show that our approach outperforms qualitatively and quantitavely these existing approaches...|$|R

In this paper, we present an approach to erase logos from video clips. Based on the histogram energy analysis of the relevant video frames, we obtain the best quality logo frame that can be easily processed in the selected region of video frames. After that, we mark the logo area in the entire sequence of frames and <b>inpaint</b> each frame of the video logo based on color interpolation. We describe our technique in this paper and also provide experimental results...|$|R

There was theoretically analyzed and practically used algorithms K-SVD and INK-SVD for dictionary learning. These dictionaries {{have been applied}} to the reconstruction of audio signals using OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit). Furthermore, there was proposed an algorithm for selecting the stationary segments and their subsequent use as training data for K-SVD and INK-SVD. In the practical part of thesis have been observed efficiency with training set selection from whole signal compared with algorithm for stationary segmentation used. The influence of mutual coherence {{on the quality of}} reconstruction with incoherent dictionary was also studied.

40|$|We {{study the}} design of deep {{architectures}} for lossy image compression. We present two architectural recipes {{in the context of}} multi-stage progressive encoders and empirically demonstrate their importance on compression performance. Specifically, we show that: (a) predicting the original image data from residuals in a multi-stage progressive architecture facilitates learning and leads to improved performance at approximating the original content and (b) learning to <b>inpaint</b> (from neighboring image pixels) before performing compression reduces the amount of information that must be stored to achieve a high-quality approximation. Incorporating these design choices in a baseline progressive encoder yields an average reduction of over 60 % in file size with similar quality compared to the original residual encoder.

30|$|In <b>inpaint</b> methods, {{an object}} of {{interest}} is tracked frame-by-frame [9, 10, 23]. Herling and Broll first used classic Snake algorithm [63] to track contours of {{an object of}} interest [9] and improved their ROI detection and tracking algorithms for video usages [10]. Their method [10] detects contours of an object of interest based on manually guided footprints in a screen space and tracks them based on homography. In a method proposed by Kawai et al., the user first draws ROI manually in a screen and the ROI determined using 3 D scene points fetched from vSLAM [55] is continuously tracked [23]. Kawai et al. present an optional manual ROI cropping procedure because the tracked ROI might include unnecessary part of {{the scene at the}} different viewpoint from the initial one.|$|R
30|$|For many applications, the {{segmentation}} will be sufficient, {{since the}} determined specular areas can simply be omitted in further computations. For others, {{it might be}} necessary or more efficient to <b>inpaint</b> the highlights. For example the colour misalignment artefacts as shown in Figure 1 (b) is a major hindrance in many processing algorithms, for example, automated polyp detection. In order to remove these artefacts the endoscope camera motion needs to be estimated. Feature point detection and matching are two pivotal steps in most camera motion estimation algorithm. Due to the invariance of positions in different colour channels of the images {{similar to the one}} shown in Figure 1 (b), the specular highlights creates a major problem for any feature matching algorithm and consequently for the camera motion estimation algorithm.|$|R

The weights {{on the local}} Fourier atoms are optimized to match the local orientation and frequency of the texture. We propose an adaptive method to decompose an image into a cartoon layer and a locally parallel texture layer using this model and a total variation cartoon model. This decomposition method is then used to denoise an image containing oscillating patterns. Finally we show how {{to take advantage of}} such a separation framework to simultaneously <b>inpaint</b> the structure and texture components of an image with missing parts. Numerical results show that our method improves state of the art algorithms for directional and complex textures. ...|$|R

Edges together with some adjacent grey/colour values are extracted and encoded using a classical edge detector, binary compression standards such as JBIG and stateof-the-art encoders such as PAQ. When decoding, information outside the seen coded data is recovered by solving the Laplace equation, i. e. we <b>inpaint</b> with the steady state of a homogeneous diffusion process. For the discrete reconstruction problem, we prove existence and uniqueness and establish a maximum-minimum principle. Furthermore, we describe an efficient multigrid algorithm. The result is a simple codec that is able to encode and decode in real time. We show that for cartoon-like images this codec can outperform the JPEG standard an...|$|R
