5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Hrvatske autoceste along the A3 motorway from January to August 2009 {{was reported to}} comprise the largest proportion of the total toll revenue {{collected by}} the company for the period: 889.8 millionkuna (approximately 121.9 millioneuro). Even though this figure is not further decomposed into the individual sections of motorway, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traffic volume data analysis that the largest portion of the toll revenue is collected on the sections between Zagreb and Slavonski Brod, and especially on those sections closest to the Ivanja Reka interchange.|$|E

This starts the induction. We prove that R(r, s) exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis R(r−1, s) and R(r, s−1) exist.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of Jews, perhaps more than 6000, found refuge in the various {{religious}} properties of Rome, including monasteries and convents; a much smaller number, took refuge in Vatican City itself. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> number of letters of protection issued by von Weizsäcker {{that many of the}} buildings possessing letters of protecting (and asserting extraterritorial status) were in fact not owned by the Church.|$|E
25|$|Many {{inscriptions}} {{consist of}} only a few words (often names) in rote phrases, and many are fragmentary.

25|$|The Jarmann rifle was {{a remarkably}} {{accurate}} rifle for its time.

After six days of marching through Jago's desert-like terrain and enduring dust-storms, the Ghosts reach their objective: Hinzerhaus, dubbed the house {{at the end of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Drawbacks of block {{interleaver}} : As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> figure, {{the columns}} are read sequentially, the receiver can interpret single row only after it receives complete message and not before that. Also, the receiver requires {{a considerable amount}} of memory in order to store the received symbols and has to store the complete message. Thus, these factors give rise to two drawbacks, one is the latency and other is the storage (fairly large amount of memory). These drawbacks can be avoided by using the convolutional interleaver described below.|$|E
25|$|Most, if not all, of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra {{were known}} of {{in some form}} or other before Kepler. A small stellated dodecahedron appears in a marble tarsia (inlay panel) on the floor of St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, Italy. It dates from the 15th century and is {{sometimes}} attributed to Paolo Uccello. In his Perspectiva corporum regularium (Perspectives of the regular solids), a book of woodcuts published in the 16th century, Wenzel Jamnitzer depicts the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general arrangement of the book that he regarded only the five Platonic solids as regular.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{department}} (ED) waiting {{times have}} a serious impact on patient mortality, morbidity with readmission in less than 30 days, length of stay, and patient satisfaction. A {{review of the literature}} bears out the logical premise that since the outcome of treatment for all diseases and injuries is time-sensitive, the sooner treatment is rendered, the better the outcome. Various studies reported significant associations between waiting times and higher mortality and morbidity among those who survived. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> literature that untimely hospital deaths and morbidity can be reduced by reductions in ED waiting times.|$|E
25|$|Frank's wife Claire runs an NGO, the Clean Water Initiative, {{which she}} uses to {{cultivate}} her own power, yet its ultimate purpose remains unknown. Despite {{the success of}} the operation, Claire seeks to expand its scope to the international stage, often using Frank's connections. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outset that Claire shares both her husband's cold-hearted, ruthless pragmatism and lust for power, and they frequently scheme together to ensure the success of each other's ventures. They both work with Remy Danton, a corporate lobbyist and former Underwood staffer, to secure funds for their operations and expand their influence.|$|E
25|$|The book's superscription {{claims that}} Jeremiah was active for forty years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah (627 BCE) {{to the fall}} of Jerusalem in 587. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last {{chapters}} of the book, however, that he continued to speak in Egypt after the assassination of Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah, in 582. This suggests that the superscription {{is trying to make}} a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to Moses – where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiah's forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} of the Church's history, celibacy was {{considered}} optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many {{that most of the}} Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that bishops, presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. It is also clear from epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature {{of the life of the}} Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.|$|E
25|$|No {{fighting}} is reported for 342. Instead the sources {{focus on a}} mutiny by part of the soldiery. According to the most common variant, following the Roman victories of 343 the Campani asked Rome for winter garrisons to protect them against the Samnites. Subverted by the luxurious lifestyle of the Campani, the garrison soldiers started plotting to seize control and set themselves up as masters of Campania. However the conspiracy was discovered by the consuls of 342 before the coup could be carried out. Afraid of being punished, the plotters mutinied, formed a rebel army and marched against Rome. Marcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator {{to deal with the}} crisis; he managed to convince the mutineers to lay down their arms without bloodshed and a series of economic, military and political reforms were passed to deal with their grievances. The history of this mutiny is however disputed among modern historians and {{it is possible that the}} whole narrative has been invented to provide a background for the important reforms passed this year. These reforms included the Leges Genuciae which stated that no one could be reelected to the same office within less than ten years, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list of consuls that except in years of great crisis this law was enforced. It also became a firm rule that one of the consuls had to be a plebeian.|$|E
