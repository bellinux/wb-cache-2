In its neutral form, bromopyrogallol red is bipolar ion, containing a protonized carbonyl group {{as well as}} a dissociated sulfonate group. Through testing at isobestic points, it has been determined that bromopyrogallol red is a stronger acid than Pyrogallol Red. In the presence of ammonia salts, the bathochromic shifts increase.

5000|$|The {{erosion and}} {{degradation}} of a polymer describe how the polymer physically loses mass (degrades). The two common erosion mechanisms are surface and bulk erosion. Polyanhydrides are surface eroding polymers. Surface eroding polymers {{do not allow}} water to penetrate into the material. They erode layer by layer, like a lollipop. The hydrophobic backbone with hydrolytically labile anhydride linkages allows hydrolytic degradation {{to be controlled by}} manipulating the polymer composition. This manipulation can occur by adding a <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> to the polyanhydride to make a copolymer. Polyanhydride copolymers with hydrophilic groups exhibit bulk eroding characteristics. Bulk eroding polymers take in water like a sponge (throughout the material) and erode inside and {{on the surface of the}} polymer.|$|E

50|$|Fast-response probes: These are {{amphiphilic}} membrane staining dyes {{which usually}} have a pair ofhydrocarbon chains acting as membrane anchors and a <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> which aligns the chromophoreperpendicular to the membrane/aqueous interface. The chromophore is believed to undergo a largeelectronic charge shift {{as a result of}} excitation from the ground to the excited state and this underlies theputative electrochromic mechanism for the sensitivity of these dyes to membrane potential. This molecule (dye) intercalates among the lipophilic part of biological membranes. This orientation assures that the excitation inducedcharge redistribution will occur parallel to the electric field within the membrane. A change in thevoltage across the membrane will therefore cause a spectral shift resulting from a direct interactionbetween the field and the ground and excited state dipole moments.|$|E
50|$|Polymers on the {{surfaces}} of the colloidal fraction of soils promote steric stabilization of those particles by preventing them from approaching each other and aggregating. This effect is seen {{in a variety of}} aqueous and nonaqueous environments, and is not affected by electrolytes in solution. The degree of steric stabilization depends on the amount of clay surface covered by adsorbed polymers, the strength of the polymer bond, the thickness of the polymer layer, and the favorability of the solvent for the polymer loops and tails. Block and graft copolymers, made up of two different homopolymers with differing solubilities in the suspension medium, are most often used for steric stabilization. When synthesized to have alternating regions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, copolymers can stabilize the suspension because their hydrophobic group adsorbs strongly to the colloid surface while the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> is attracted to the solvent. In general, the adsorption of polymers to clay surfaces is entropically favored because one polymer molecule displaces many water molecules which were previously bound to the soil particle.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} postoperative posterior capsular striae (PCS) and its influence on posterior capsular opacification (PCO) in patients implanted with two types of lens material. Setting: Tertiary eye care center in central rural India. Study Design: A prospective, observational, nonrandomized study. Materials and Methods: The study included 1247 patients having age-related cataract scheduled for removal by phacoemulsification technique and implantation of hydrophilic or hydrophobic intraocular lens (IOL). Demographic profile, nuclear grading, axial length, and IOL power were noted. Details of PCS were noted on the 1 st postoperative day in patients with clear cornea. Postoperative follow-up was ensured to study the status of PCS and development of PCO. Results: The overall incidence of PCS was 19. 8 % (247 out of 1247 eyes). Out of 1247 patients, 641 patients (51. 4 %) had hydrophilic IOL implantation and 201 eyes had PCS (31. 4 %) and 606 patients (48. 6 %) had hydrophobic IOL implantation and 46 eyes had PCS (7. 6 %), P = 0. 04. Three and more striae were seen in 119 eyes (119 / 641, 18. 6 %) in <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> and 4 eyes (4 / 606, 0. 66 %) in hydrophobic group. Sixty-two eyes (62 / 201, 30. 9 %) in <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> with multiple PCS were reported with persistent striae after 6 months of surgery. Two eyes in hydrophobic group had persistent striae even after 3 years of follow-up. Evaluation of PCO score of the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> was 0. 6 whereas of the hydrophobic group was 0. 1 (P = 0. 04). Ten patients of the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>group</b> only required neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (ND: YAG) laser capsulotomy. Conclusion: The incidence of PCS was higher in hydrophilic than hydrophobic IOLs. Multiple PCS persisting in patients beyond 6 months after operation should be followed up for early development of PCO, particularly in patients implanted with hydrophilic IOL...|$|E
