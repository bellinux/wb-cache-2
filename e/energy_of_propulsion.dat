[...] The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at an approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible. [...] The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing. It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored.

The matter <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> production and usage, therefore, needs to be tackled on every possible front with a greater sense of urgency. This is the background against which research, at the University of New South Wales by the author and his team, are being conducted. Although the work originally started with applications to aerospace industry in mind, it has become evident that some of the novel techniques and concepts developed as a consequence, would have wider applications opening up new horizons of research of positive scientific, economic and environmental significance.

Two ramjet engine scenarios, where the thrust for propulsion is generated by emission of photons or acceleration of matter, are outlined. As long as not all collected matter is transformed into fusion energy, mass engines are superior to photon engines.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{systems for}} cars, trucks and construction machineries {{has become one}} of the most important topics in today’s mobile system design, mainly because of increased fuel costs and new regulations about engine emissions, which is needed to save the environment. To meet the increased requirements on higher efficiency and better functionality, components and systems have been developed over the years. For the last ten years the development of hybrid systems can be divided into two major technologies, electric hybrids and hydraulic hybrids. Today, there is a hard competition between these two branches. Therefore, it is interesting to compare these two technologies to figure out their individual capabilities. This paper will discover the advantages of hydraulic hybrid systems over electric hybrids and how to succeed with the hybrid system design. One obvious advantage with hydraulic hybrid systems is that they create a unique opportunity to optimize the engine loading at all speeds. About the power density, hydraulic machines have around 5 times higher density than electric machines. This gives the opportunity to use direct hydraulic drive and remove mechanical gearings needed in an electric hybrid system. This fact has a large impact on the system overall efficiency. By using hydraulic accumulators, a part of the potential load energy can be reused, which make it possible to design a system with improved endurance compared with a similar one without such devices. This kind of regenerative capabilities increase the power supply capability. The additional power can be used to improve the performance of the system, without increasing the primary engine power. Another advantage of using a hydraulic accumulator is that its round-trip efficiency is higher than for an electric battery, especially at frequent acceleration and braking...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} efficiency of a rowing oar during the drive phrase {{may be defined}} as that proportion <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> put into the oar by the rower which is "usefully" dissipated in overcoming hull and aerodynamic drag as the boat is propelled forwards. Ignoring friction in the oar gate/pivot, the remaining energy is "uselessly" dissipated by the blade as it shifts and churns water. As an example <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems, the <b>energy</b> efficiency for a slipping and a non-slipping car wheel is derived. The same method applied to the oar, shows that {{the efficiency of the}} oar is inextricably related to the direction of the water reaction force on the blade. If, as is usually assumed, the force is normal to the oar-shaft direction, the efficiency of the oar can be expressed as V sin(A) /(omega l), where V is the hull speed through the water, omega is the rotational speed of the oar, l is the distance from the gate to the centre of force on the blade, and A is the angle of the oar-shaft to the boat forward direction. We consider the efficiency of the oar from catch to square-off, using data gathered from an elite eight rowing at the Australian Institute of Sport. We show that, except for a degree or two of oar-sweep at the catch, when the force is negligible, the efficiency is greatest towards square-off, where a greater portion of the blade force is directed forward, which agrees with the results of Affeld et al. (Int. J. Sports Medicine, 14 :S 39 -S 41, 1993). Correlations of force profile shape with average efficiency show that a later application of the maximum force, nearer square-off, is generally more efficient than an earlier application. However, since the oar efficiency increases with boat speed, less efficient oars, for which the maximum force is applied near the catch, cause a greater increase of the boat speed early in the stroke, and this tends to enhance the efficiency of all the oars later in the stroke...|$|R

A key enabling technology for such an ambitious science and exploration effort is the development <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems capable <b>of</b> providing fast trip times; mission duration should not exceed the professional lifetime of the investigative team. Advanced propulsion technologies that might support an interstellar precursor mission early in the next century include some combination of solar sails, nuclear electric propulsion systems, and aerogravity assists. Follow-on missions to far beyond the heliopause will require the development <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> technologies that are only at the conceptual stage today. These include 1) matter-antimatter annihilation, 2) beamed-energy sails, and 3) fusion systems. For years, the scientific community has been interested in the development of solar sail technology to support exploration of the inner and outer planets. Progress in thin-film technology and the development of technologies that may enable the remote assembly of large sails in space are only now maturing to the point where ambitious interstellar precursor missions can be considered. Electric propulsion is now being demonstrated for planetary exploration by the Deep Space 1 mission. The primary issues for it's adaptation to interstellar precursor applications include the nuclear reactor that would be required and the engine lifetime. For further term interstellar missions, matter-antimatter annihilation propulsion system concepts have the highest <b>energy</b> density <b>of</b> any <b>propulsion</b> systems using onboard propellants.

However, fusion technology is still considered immature, even after many decades of well-funded research. Furthermore, fusion alone does not offer high enough energy density to make it a viable candidate for interstellar propulsion unless propellant can be collected in situ, as was considered by R. Bussard for his interstellar ramjet concept. The current research in investigating these propulsion systems will be described, and the range of application of each technology will be explored...|$|R
