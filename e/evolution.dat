5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that <b>evolution</b> {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such {{objections}} often come down to debates over how <b>evolution</b> is defined (see the Defining <b>evolution</b> section above). Under the conventional biological definition of <b>evolution,</b> {{it is a simple}} matter to observe <b>evolution</b> occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the <b>evolution</b> of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental <b>evolution,</b> particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how <b>evolution</b> occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is that <b>evolution</b> {{is based}} on unreliable evidence, claiming that <b>evolution</b> is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for <b>evolution</b> {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that <b>evolution</b> is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of <b>evolution,</b> not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that <b>evolution</b> is not a religion and that teaching <b>evolution</b> does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v.

5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} <b>evolution</b> {{presents}} <b>evolution</b> as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism.

5|$|Critics of <b>evolution</b> {{commonly}} {{appeal to}} past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects of <b>evolution,</b> the current evidence for <b>evolution</b> is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for <b>evolution</b> {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolution</b> {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the <b>evolution</b> of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of <b>evolution,</b> but that specific circumstances of <b>evolution</b> on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in <b>evolution.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of <b>evolution,</b> with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} <b>evolution</b> in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed <b>evolution</b> as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v.

5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that <b>evolution</b> {{supports}} concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that <b>evolution</b> gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that <b>evolution</b> has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in <b>evolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} <b>evolution</b> itself. In the context of biology, <b>evolution</b> is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular <b>evolution</b> to sociocultural <b>evolution</b> to stellar and galactic <b>evolution.</b> When biological <b>evolution</b> is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both <b>evolution</b> and an active deity (theistic <b>evolution).</b> This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support <b>evolution,</b> or among the general public that supports <b>evolution.</b> Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{describing}} time-evolutions of noncommutative worlds, I discuss symmetry-preserving <b>evolutions</b> of noncommutative worlds of finite dimensional representation spaces. An interesting issue in such <b>evolutions</b> {{is that there}} can be transitions of representation spaces of symmetry, and therefore the <b>evolutions</b> are generally non-unitary or symmetry-violating. The central idea of this paper is that a main world evolves by emitting baby worlds which compensate the violations of the symmetry of the main world. Tracing out the states of the baby worlds, the symmetry-preserving <b>evolutions</b> of the density matrices of the main world are obtained. I give a simple example with SU(2) symmetry, which can be regarded as an evolving quantum two-sphere. This simple model has some attractive features resembling our universe: it gets born from a vacuum and its entropy of geometric origin grows. I also discuss the <b>evolutions</b> in Heisenberg picture. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, LaTe...|$|R
