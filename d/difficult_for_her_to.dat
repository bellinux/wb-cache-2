5|$|Although she {{appeared}} {{on television and}} in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E
5|$|Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar {{winner for}} Gandhi, was the costume {{designer}} for the film. With {{a large number}} of extras, it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make enough costumes. She {{spent a lot of time}} researching to lend authenticity to the characters.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

Miss Snoqualmie {{discover that they}} {{have much in common}} that way, during their expedition to Antarctica.|$|R
5|$|McLeod fully transitioned to the Canadian senior {{national}} team following her {{performance at the}} U-19 World Championship. She has stated that the transition was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> due <b>to</b> the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she often took the back seat to more experienced players, which affected her confidence.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the death of Rudy's pet goldfish, which was {{difficult}} to explain to her and <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> deal with. The episode was a critical and commercial success, achieving both high ratings and positive critical feedback. Its viewer ratings placed it third for the opening week of the 1984–85 United States network television season and it earned Primetime Emmy Award and Writers Guild Award nominations for its writing.|$|E
5|$|Jose Sarria's mother {{continued}} {{to work for the}} Jost family but it became increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> fulfil her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and after meeting with her Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.|$|E
5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began ballet lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War Godin {{helped in}} the {{reorganization}} of the Catholic Women's League and {{in the care of}} refugees, which was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> due <b>to</b> poor health. She worked as a translator of literature and interpreter. From afar she critically followed the developments in socialist Albania - in particular the persecution of the Catholic clergy.|$|R
50|$|In 1968 a {{group of}} {{steamboat}} enthusiasts formed the Northwest Steamship Company, and raised the funds to buy Virginia V from Puget Sound Excursion Company. The ship {{was placed on the}} National Registry of Historic Sites in 1973, but despite her recognition as historically significant, it was increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> owners <b>to</b> maintain <b>her</b> as a commercial venture.|$|R

5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{went into}} her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the {{declared}} aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening sprint, which was contested at Whistler Olympic Park in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5seconds behind Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina. She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent pursuit race. Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3seconds. In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the individual. She had three shooting mistakes and said it had been <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the mass start. After missing two targets, she had been trailing {{by as much as}} 29seconds, but she pushed the pace and a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's Olga Zaitseva on the last lap. After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the relay, citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend Martina Beck a start in her last Olympic Games. Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the German flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Kelly faced several {{difficult}} issues and obstacles, {{often with the}} assistance of loved ones, including her occasionally difficult home life, being trapped in a fire, being tricked into joining a cult, and becoming temporarily addicted to cocaine. In addition to many other matters, she endured getting amnesia, shooting her rapist in self-defense, becoming unexpectedly pregnant and having a miscarriage, and learning that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have children because of a condition called endometriosis. In overcoming these matters, she was able to become a better person and help others.|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} {{determined}} {{that she would}} {{write a letter to}} M. Urmand, and show a copy of the letter <b>to</b> <b>her</b> uncle when the post should have taken it so far out of Granpere on its way to Basle, as to make it impossible that her uncle should recall it. Much of the day after George's departure, and much of the night, was spent in the preparation of this letter. Marie Bromar was not so well practised in the writing of letters as will be the majority of the young ladies who may, perhaps, read her history. It was a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> begin the letter, and a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> bring it to its end. But the letter was written and sent. The post left Granpere at about eight in the morning, taking all letters by way of Remiremont; and on the day following George's departure, the post took Marie Bromar's letter to M. Urmand.|$|R
50|$|Juliana Maria was {{personally}} described as good-looking and sensible, but {{the marriage was}} not popular in Denmark, where it was considered {{to have taken place}} too soon after the death of her predecessor, the popular former queen Louise, and it was a <b>difficult</b> task <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> replace <b>her</b> popular predecessor. She had several stepchildren by marriage, but she was given no influence over their upbringing.|$|R
60|$|Since her {{interview}} with Westervelt, Zenobia's continual inequalities of temper had been rather <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> friends <b>to</b> bear. On the first Sunday after that incident, when Hollingsworth had clambered down from Eliot's pulpit, she declaimed with great earnestness and passion, {{nothing short of}} anger, on the injustice which the world did to women, and equally to itself, by not allowing them, in freedom and honor, and with the fullest welcome, their natural utterance in public.|$|R
25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not even have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, President Eisenhower {{nominated}} a recovered Luce {{to be the}} US Ambassador to Brazil. She {{began to}} learn enough of the Portuguese language {{in preparation for the}} job, but she was by now so conservative that her appointment met with strong opposition from a small number of Democratic senators. Leading the charge was Oregon Senator Wayne Morse. Still, Luce was confirmed by a 79 to 11 vote. Her husband urged her to decline the appointment, noting that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work with Morse, who chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Latin American Affairs. Luce eventually sent Eisenhower a letter explaining that she felt that the controversy surrounding her appointment would hinder her abilities to be respected by both her Brazilian and US coworkers and resigned from her position as ambassador. She had served only four days, from April 28 to May 1, 1959, and she had never left American soil.|$|E
50|$|An {{actor is}} {{sometimes}} so strongly {{identified with a}} role as to make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him or <b>her</b> <b>to</b> find work playing other characters. It is especially common among leading actors in popular TV series and films.|$|R

The Fosters moved back to Alabama in 1974, and Lucy obtained {{a position in the}} Birmingham school system.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
25|$|Masuzoe has {{married three}} times. His first {{marriage}} {{was to a}} French woman whom he met while studying in Europe; they divorced. He married Ministry of Finance bureaucrat Satsuki Katayama in 1986; they were divorced in 1989 and Katayama later {{became a member of}} the Diet. Masuzoe is known to have five children, three of which were born out of wedlock by two other women; one of his children, aged 25 as of 2014, is seriously disabled, and Masuzoe's negotiations with the child's mother over support payments drew attention in the Japanese tabloid press. Prime Minister Abe said that he wanted Katayama more than anyone else to stand in support of Masuzoe's 2014 gubernatorial bid, but Katayama responded that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do so given the state of the negotiations. The magazine Nikkan Gendai reported in 2007 that Masuzoe held a wedding ceremony with another Japanese woman in France (but was not legally married to her) before marrying his first wife.|$|E
25|$|Li Yuan {{began to}} gather {{forces from the}} region, {{claiming}} that they were necessary to defend against the Turks, which drew suspicions from his deputies Wang Wei (王威) and Gao Junya (高君雅). Li Yuan, afraid that Wang and Gao would act against him first, then used a Turkish attack {{as an excuse to}} falsely claim that Wang and Gao were working in concert with the Turkish khagan, Shibi Khan (Ashina Duojishi), and had them executed. He sent secret messengers to Hedong to recall his sons Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji (both by Duchess Dou) and Li Zhiyun (李智雲, by his concubine Lady Wan), whom he had left there to watch over his household, and the capital Chang'an to recall his daughter (the future Princess Pingyang) and her husband Chai Shao (柴紹). Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, leaving Li Zhiyun at Hedong, soon met with Chai, and they arrived together at Taiyuan. Li Yuan's daughter, believing it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> flee with Chai, chose to hide instead.|$|E

Korobeynikova placed 7th at her first Grand Prix assignment, the 2012 Rostelecom Cup. At her next event, the 2012 Trophée Eric Bompard, she was 5th in the short program and finished 6th overall. Korobeynikova said the season was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> due <b>to</b> an injury and some growing which affected her balance. She finished 10th at the 2013 Russian Championships.|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} [...] "Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites" [...] in late 1959/early 1960 led Francis {{to become one}} of the first American artists to record in other {{languages}} regularly. She was to be followed by other major British and American recording stars including Wanda Jackson, Cliff Richard, Petula Clark, Brenda Lee, the Supremes, Peggy March, Pat Boone, Lesley Gore, the Beatles and Johnny Cash, among many others. In her autobiography, Francis mentioned that in the early years of her career, the language barrier in certain European countries made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> songs <b>to</b> get airplay, especially in Germany.|$|R
25|$|The film {{adaptation}} makes much of de Janzé's eccentricities, including {{scenes in}} which she watches a polo match with a snake twined around her shoulders, or doses herself with a syringe of morphine in the ladies' toilet. In 1988, Miles stated at the Cannes Film Festival that as an actress de Janzé was a <b>difficult</b> character <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> portray. When she first arrived in Kenya, Miles sought people who knew Alice {{but was unable to}} learn anything substantial due to those acquaintances' confused perceptions of de Janzé; some were even uncertain as <b>to</b> <b>her</b> true nationality.|$|R
25|$|She {{was from}} the outset {{considered}} to have great promise, but it was nevertheless <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> win the leading roles from more established actors such as Zelma Hedin, Charlotta Almlöf, and Fanny Westerdahl, {{the stars of the}} 1850s. She had a brief affair with the Crown Prince, the future Charles XV of Sweden, who advised her to marry Daniel Hwasser, the secretary of the royal theatres direction, which oversaw the royal theatre. She took the Crown Prince's advice and married Hwasser in 1858, after which he was made director of the theatre. The fact that Elise Hwasser was suddenly awarded leading roles did not go unnoticed in the press: during her husband's short period as director of the theatre, she played all the leading female parts. Although this may very well have been the result of nepotism, it is equally clear that she did have talent as an actress – a talent that she was now able to demonstrate. Proof of this is provided by the fact that, after her husband had been dismissed as a director and her royal lover had acquired a new mistress, she nevertheless continued to play the leading female parts. Whatever means she had employed, she had now proven herself and, for the next thirty years, she played the leading female role in well over one hundred and fifty performances.|$|E

Azarenka dominated the final match, as Serena was playing while nursing a leg injury. Azarenka won the match, securing third title of her career. Azarenka stated {{that she was very}} nervous in the final game of the match and described her win as [...] "the biggest moment in [...] career". Serena mentioned that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> move to the left, but she still played with maximum effort.|$|E

In October 2012, in an interview with Allure, Conrad stated that while [...] "the story told wasn't a dishonest one, the way [...] did it sometimes was". She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members, and commented that her relationship with Jenner was [...] "pretty brief" [...] and [...] "definitely [...] to drag it out". In July 2013, when discussing the filming of several alternate finale endings, MTV acknowledged that [...] "maybe the term 'reality TV' didn't perfectly apply to The Hills".|$|E
5000|$|While {{she was at}} London, Manley had {{discovered}} {{that the people of}} Jamaica had collected the money <b>to</b> buy <b>her</b> piece [...] "Negro Aroused". Individuals pitched in whatever they could afford, purchasing the piece to begin a national art collection. She was highly moved by this act, partly because she claimed that it was such a <b>difficult</b> piece <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> create: [...] "Negro Aroused,...was trying to create a national vision, and it nearly killed me, it was trying to put something into being that was bigger than myself and almost other than myself," [...] Manley told Sculpture Review.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{two levels}} being {{separate}} on most cars, there is a physical limitation on the conductor, as it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him or <b>her</b> <b>to</b> verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car on each level, owing to the sometimes short distance between stops.|$|R
50|$|In her {{autobiography}} Who's Sorry Now?, {{published in}} 1984, Francis mentioned {{that in the}} early years of her career the language barrier in certain European countries made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> songs <b>to</b> get airplay, especially in Germany. Following this observation, it was decided that Francis would record a German version of her U. S. # hit Everybody's Somebody's Fool, entitled Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel with lyrics written by veteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel. The song peaked at # 1 in Germany for two weeks, as it did in many other countries, and Francis would have six more # 1 hits on the German charts.|$|R
