In the owned-dog population, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> immigration, abandonment and births was 19 %, 16 % and 6 % <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the carrying capacity, respectively. In the sterilized owned-dog population, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> abandonment, female and male sterilization was 37 %, 30 % and 27 % <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the carrying capacity. In the stray population, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> abandonment, carrying capacity of the owned-dog population and adoption was 10 %, 9 % and 6 % <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the carrying capacity.
