50|$|Second is {{the patch}} reef community. Patch reefs form {{in shallow water}} (three to six meters deep), some in Hawk Channel and some on the outer reef, but mainly on White Bank between Hawk Channel and the outer reefs. Patch reefs start from corals growing on a hard bottom, but grow upward as new corals {{establish}} themselves on the skeletons of dead corals. Most {{of the structure of}} patch reefs is formed from star (Montastraea annularis, Siderastrea siderea) and brain corals (Diploria spp.). Other corals attach wherever there is an opening. Patch reefs may grow up {{to the surface of the}} water, and spread outwards. Dome-type patch reefs (such as Hen and Chickens), found in Hawk Channel and on White Bank, are round or elliptical, and are generally less than three meters high, but may reach up to nine meters high. Dome-type patch reefs are surrounded by sand which is kept clear due to browsing by long-spined sea urchins and grass-eating fish. Linear-type patch reefs are found on the outer reefs, and are linear or curved. They occur in single or multiple rows, trending the same direction as the bank reefs on the outer reefs. Linear-type patch reefs often include Elkhorn coral, which is rare on the dome-type patch reefs. As dead coral skeletons age and are weakened by the activities of boring sponges, worms, and mollusks and by wave action, parts of a patch reef may collapse. Patch reefs provide habitat for spiny lobsters and for many species of fish, including Bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), damselfish (Chromis spp.), Ocean surgeon, French and Queen angelfish (Pomacanthus spp.), White, Caesar and Spanish grunts (Haemulon ssp.), Yellowtail and other snappers, Redband and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma ssp.), Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), Tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum), Trumpetfish (Aulostomus maculatus), filefish, groupers, snappers, Bar jack (Caranx ruber), <b>Great</b> <b>barracuda,</b> pufferfish, squirrelfish, cardinalfish, and green morays (Gymnothorax funebris).|$|E

40|$|<b>Great</b> <b>{{barracuda}}</b> Sphyraena barracuda {{is a large}} predatory teleost found circumglobally, {{other than}} the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The species is commonly caught by both recreational and commercial fishermen as bycatch while targeting other, more economically or recreationally valuable fishes. This species also exhibits an ontogenetic shift in habitat, with juveniles inhabiting mangrove and seagrass habitats, while adults live near offshore reefs and associated structure. This thesis consists of two separate studies of S. barracuda: 1) feeding ecology along an ontogenetic gradient and 2) habitat utilization of as derived through electronic tagging. The first chapter of this thesis describes the feeding ecology of <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> in South Florida, {{with an emphasis on}} the determination of when the ontogenetic shift in diet occurs between habitats and individual fish sizes. Specimens were collected primarily by seine net and hook-and-line fishing. The specimens were then dissected with the stomach contents examined. This study found that the ontogenetic diet shift in <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> begins around the second year, and that juveniles and adults are opportunistic predators with a wide diversity of teleost and crustacean prey items within the selected habitat. The second chapter of this thesis describes the habitat utilization and vertical movements of two <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> off of South Florida interpreted from data acquired from pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs).

40|$|<b>Great</b> <b>barracuda</b> (Sphyraena barracuda) {{are a large}} predatory {{species that}} is {{frequently}} caught by fishermen off of South Florida. This species exhibits an ontogenetic shift in habitat moving from seagrass and mangrove areas as juveniles to offshore reefs and wrecks as adults. The food habits of <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> were investigated by analyzing the stomachs of both juveniles and adults. Fish were obtained by several different fishing methods, including hook-and-line fishing, spearfishing and a seine net. Barracuda were also donated by local fishermen and charter boat captains. Index of relative importance (IRI) {{was used to compare}} food types across size ranges. A high percentage of the stomach analyzed throughout this study were empty. As of January 2014, 251 barracuda have been analyzed, with 67 (27 %) being adults. Of all 251 fish analyzed, only 55 had identifiable prey items in their stomachs. Preliminary results show that barracuda caught in the juvenile habitat fed primarily on killifish (Cyprinodontidae) and penaeid shrimp. Results with juveniles show {{that they were able to}} feed on a variety of prey items without being dependent on one particular food source. Although previous work has shown that juvenile barracuda were almost entirely piscivorous, our preliminary work has shown that penaeids play a major part (%) in their diet as well. Further research is needed to establish any seasonal trends in the adult barracuda diet. This study will provide valuable information about the feeding ecology of barracuda off South Florida, which could lead to better conservation of the species...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are increasing in popularity {{as a tool}} to manage fish stocks through conservation of entire habitats and fish assemblages. Quantifying the habitat use, site fidelity, and movement patterns of marine species is vital to this method of marine spatial planning. The success of these {{protected areas}} requires that sufficient habitat is guarded against fishing pressure. For large animals, which often have correspondingly large home range areas, protecting an entire home range can be logistically challenging. For MPAs to successfully protect large top predator species, {{it is important to understand}} what areas of a home range are especially important, such as breeding and feeding grounds. New technologies, such as acoustic telemetry, have made it possible to track marine animal movements at finer spatial and temporal scales than previously possible, better illuminating these spatial use patterns. This study focused on the movement patterns of <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> (n= 35), an ecologically important top predator, around Buck Island Reef National Monument, a no-take MPA in St. Croix, U. S. V. I. managed by the National Park Service. As developing standardized methods for acoustic telemetry is still a work in progress, the first half of this study focuses on determining appropriate tools for generating home range size estimates for <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> and analyzing ecological parameters driving these results. The second half of this study focused on the use of network analysis to look at spatial divisions within individual home ranges and to compare individual to population level spatial patterns, as well as to generate a relative estimate of population density within the park. Barracuda within the park demonstrated high site fidelity to individual territories, but at the population level they consistently used all habitats within the array. Core use areas within home ranges were evenly distributed throughout all habitats monitored by the acoustic array, although movement corridors were detected along high rugosity reef structures. Greater population densities within the park indicate that density dependent behaviors may be influencing habitat use within the park, and suggest that barracuda are contributing high levels of top down pressure through predation within the park boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Many {{marine fishes}} use the {{mangrove}} ecosystem for foraging, protection, spawning {{and as a}} nursery habitat To develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the local mangrove and coral reef ecosystems, the ontogentic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes were examined through the use of stable isotope ratios Juvenile and adult reef fishes, including species such as, the grey snapper Lutjanus griseus, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> Sphyraena barracuda, were collected both from mangrove a coral reef sites located near Port Everglades, Broward County, Florida All species were analyzed using δ 13 C and δ 15 N from muscle tissues and δ 18 O and δ 13 C from otoliths to evaluate ontogenetic migrations, foraging, and occupation within both the mangrove and reef sites Preliminary δ 18 O and δ 13 C otolith data indicate mangroves to be more depleted than offshore reef habitats, indicating that juvenile fish are utilizing the mangroves The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in muscle tissue is more depleted in juvenile fish caught from the mangroves than fish adult fish caught on the reef This study will help clarify the relative importance of the various habitats essential for early life-history stages of reef fishes...|$|E

This study examined the ontogenetic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes in Broward County, Florida to develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the local mangrove and coral reef ecosystems. Four species of reef fishes – grey snapper Lutjanus griseus, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> Sphyraena barracuda– were collected both from mangrove sites located adjacent to Port Everglades and coral reef sites located nearby offshore of Port Everglades in Broward County.

Preliminary d 18 O and d 13 C otolith data indicated mangroves to be more enriched than offshore reef habitats. Food sources found in the mangroves are expected to be more enriched in 13 C and 15 N due to more recycling of nutrients.

To develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the coastal mangrove and coral reef ecosystems, the ontogentic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes were examined through the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) stable isotope ratios. Juvenile and adult gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, lane snapper L. synagris, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, French grunt H. flavolineatum, sailor’s choice H. parra, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> Sphyraena barracuda were collected from both mangrove and coral reef sites located near Port Everglades, Broward County, Florida. All species were analyzed for δ 13 C and δ 15 N of muscle tissues and δ 18 O and δ 13 C of otoliths to evaluate ontogenetic migrations, foraging, and occupation within both the mangrove and reef sites. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in muscle tissue were more depleted in juvenile fish from the mangroves than their adult forms caught on the adjacent reef. The δ 18 O and δ 13 C otolith data were significantly different between species, age class, and habitat, with lower δ 18 O values for juvenile fish caught in the mangroves. A general trend of increasing δ 13 C in otoliths corresponded to increasing total length, also suggesting juvenile movements from mangrove to nearshore reefs with age.

40|$|Ciguatera {{in humans}} is {{typically}} {{caused by the}} consumption of reef fish that have accumulated Ciguatoxins (CTXs) in their flesh. Over a six month period, we captured 38 wild adult <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> (Sphyraena barracuda), a species commonly associated with ciguatera in The Bahamas. We sampled three tissues (i. e.,muscle, liver, and blood) and analysed them {{for the presence of}} ciguatoxins using a functional in vitro N 2 A bioassay. Detectable concentrations of ciguatoxins found in the three tissue types ranged from 2. 51 to 211. 74 pg C-CTX- 1 equivalents/ g. Blood and liver toxin concentrations were positively correlated (ρ= 0. 86, P= 0. 003), indicating that, for the first time, blood sampling provides a non-lethal method of detecting ciguatoxin in wild fish. Non-lethal blood sampling also presents opportunities to couple this approachwith biotelemetry and biologging techniques that enable the study of fish distribution and movement. To demonstrate the potential for linking ciguatoxin occurrencewith barracuda spatial ecology,we also present a proof-of-concept case studywhere blood samples were obtained from 20 fish before releasing them with acoustic transmitters and tracking them in the coastal waters using a fixed acoustic telemetry array covering 44 km 2. Fish that tested positive for CTX may have smaller home ranges than non-toxic fish (median distance travelled, U= 2. 21, P= 0. 03). Results presented from this study may help identify high risk areas and source-sink dynamics of toxins, potentially reducing the incidence and human health risk of ciguatera fish poisoning. Moreover, development of the non-lethal sampling approach and measurement of ciguatera fromblood provide future opportunities to understand the mechanistic relationship between toxins and the spatial ecology of a broad range of marine fish species...|$|E
40|$|Functional morphologists have {{extensively}} used {{measurements of}} performance {{to investigate the}} relationship among form, function and ecology through ontogeny. Among different measurements of performance bite force {{play a crucial role}} influencing fitness. Although, bite force has been thoroughly investigated among vertebrates, the majority of the studies on fishes have been concentrated only in small species. Consequently, this is the first study that compares the bite force performance in two large marine predators, the <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> (Sphyraena barracuda) and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Values of posterior bite force in S. barracuda varied from 3 - 258 N for an ontogenetic series of 27 individuals (23 - 130 cm, TL). Bite force as well as the majority of the biomechanical variables that contribute to it scaled with isometry in S. barracuda. Values of posterior bite force in C. leucas varied from 170 - 5, 914 N for and ontogenetic series of 16 individuals (73 - 285 cm, TL). Bite force at the most anterior bite point scaled with positive allometry as well as the majority of the subdivisions of the adductive musculature that greatly contribute to bite force. Bite force performance in this two species showed strong differences, where S. barracuda has one of the lowest relative values of bite force among fishes and C. leucas has one of the largest ones. Additionally, the scaling patterns for bite force and most of the biomechanical variables investigated in this study differed among these two species. These results suggest that predatory success may be acquired by different strategies, and that the same ecological role in a marine ecosystem may be reached by having different bite force performance...|$|E
40|$|Although {{early studies}} qualitatively {{documented}} {{the importance of}} cross-habitat energy transfers from seagrasses to coral reefs, such exchanges {{have yet to be}} quantified. Empirical evidence suggests that grazing by reef-associated herbivores along the coral reef–seagrass interface can be intense (e. g. conspicuous presence of bare-sand ‘halos’ surrounding coral reefs). This evidence must be interpreted with caution, however, as most of it comes from areas that have experienced sustained, intense overfishing. To quantify the impacts of piscivore removal on cross-habitat energy exchange at the coral reef–seagrass interface, we compared grazing intensity along fished and no-take reefs in the upper and lower Florida Keys. Using visual census techniques and direct measures of seagrass grazing, we documented the impacts of piscivore density on herbivory along the seagrass–coral reef interface. Grazing rates were greater than observed seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) production near reefs in the upper Keys, but less than 48 % of production in the lower Keys. Analyses showed that these large differences were not related to regional differences in either herbivore density or species composition. Seagrass biomass was also lower near reefs in the upper Keys, where estimates of grazing were highest. Piscivores were dominated by transient predators (jacks and barracudas) whose densities varied with region and distance from reef, but not with protection from fishing. A nonsignificant negative correlation between <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> density and leaf losses from tethered shoots, coupled with the greater abundances of larger grazers near reefs, suggests that predation risk, rather than direct reductions in density, may limit grazers to intense feeding on seagrasses adjacent to reefs in the upper Keys. The large-scale variation in grazing intensity illustrates the need for more detailed quantifications of energy exchanges along the seagrass–coral reef boundary...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the January 2010 cold spell on mangrove utilizing coral reef fishes off the southeast coast of Florida, USA, in the vicinity of Biscayne National Park (BNP). An ongoing, fishery-independent mangrove visual survey documenting fish assemblages in BNP provided data from the years 1998 to 2014 for examination. Of particular interest were the presence, abundance, and size structure for five mangrove utilizing coral reef fishes: sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), yellowfin mojarra (Gerres cinereus), schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus), gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), and <b>great</b> <b>barracuda</b> (Sphyraena barracuda). These species were selected for analysis due to their economic and ecologic importance, their potential as environmental indicators, their connectedness to multiple habitats, and their abundance within the available data set. Data were collected using a modified visual ‘belt transect’ method, consisting of 60 m 2 transects running parallel to the mangrove shorelines. Data for average length of fish were reconstructed to form standard normal distributions and the resulting lengths were assigned to various age-classes to create species-specific length-frequency distributions. Variations in presence and abundance were examined across three time periods (1998 - 2009; 2010 - 2011; 2012 - 2014), as well as comparisons of length-frequency distributions. Following the January 2010 cold spell, the presence and abundance values for the two years immediately following the event were significantly decreased compared to the years prior to the cold spell for most of the five species at either mainland (ML) or leeward key (LK) locations. Additionally, the presence and abundance estimates typically remained statistically decreased when compared against the remaining years in the available data set. The size structures {{for the majority of the}} five species at either location, however, were not consistently significantly different between the three time periods, as was hypothesized. Instead, the analyses showed mixed results, with the size structure typically shifting towards smaller individuals immediately following the event. These findings suggest that drops in water temperature resulting from cold spells are capable of directly impacting mangrove utilizing reef fish species, albeit to varying degrees depending on various factors, such as physiological tolerances, ecological life history strategies, and habitat requirements...|$|E
