5000|$|Large Diesel {{engines are}} {{sometimes}} {{fitted with a}} secondary protection device that actuates if the governor should fail. [...] This consists of a <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> in the air intake. If the engine overspeeds, the air flow through the intake will rise to an abnormal level. This causes the <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> to snap shut, starving the engine of air and shutting it down.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{a device}} called an Avalung has been {{introduced}} for use in avalanche terrain. The device consists of a mouth piece, a <b>flap</b> <b>valve,</b> an exhaust pipe, and an air collector. Several models of Avalung either mount on one's chest or integrate in a proprietary backpack.|$|E
5000|$|Archie Scott Brown {{drove the}} Elva-Butterworth Mk III sports-racing {{car in a}} support race at the Silverstone International Trophy meeting in 1957 where: [...] "The Elva-Butterworth retired with a broken valve-Butterworth will have {{difficulty}} living this down but, in fact, it was an exhaust valve and not a Butterworth <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> which dropped." ...|$|E
50|$|Scallops {{and file}} clams can swim by {{opening and closing}} their valves rapidly by alternatingly {{contracting}} and relaxing their adductor muscles; water is ejected {{on either side of}} the hinge area and they move with the <b>flapping</b> <b>valves</b> in front.|$|R

50|$|Blow-off systemInitially, 4 {{rectangular}} blow-off <b>flaps</b> (<b>valves)</b> were installed; {{later they}} were changed to 8 round flaps. Further during the re-design process, specifically from prototype engine V-07 onwards, this implementation was changed to a different, better controllable system which involved an annular blow-off belt.|$|R
50|$|Sudbrook {{is joined}} by the Latchmere Stream just beyond Ham Gate Pond. Sudbrook then flows into Sudbrook Park, Petersham, and is culverted for the {{remainder}} of its course, discharging into the tidal River Thames to the east of 'River Lane' where the culvert outfall is protected from tidal backflow by a <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An initial {{collapse}} {{occurred in}} June 1978 {{in a section}} of outfall pipe in River Lane (...) , off the main A307. The lane is prone to tidal flooding and the outfall is protected by a <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The damage proved to be sufficiently extensive to justify a temporary repair and letting a contract for permanent replacement of a long section.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the stroke}} had begun, the cataract's rocking lever was pushed {{downwards}} by the engine. This lifted the plunger, which {{acted as a}} suction pump within the cataract to refill the plunger box, through a <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> from its surrounding cistern. The cistern was kept filled with water by the pump that the engine itself was working.|$|E
50|$|In 1894 HÃ¶rbiger had an {{idea for}} a new design of blast furnace blowing engine: he {{replaced}} the old and easily damaged leather <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> with a steel valve.

50|$|A {{diaphragm}} pump (also {{known as a}} Membrane pump) is a positive displacement pump that uses {{a combination of the}} reciprocating action of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves {{on either side of the}} diaphragm(check <b>valve,</b> butterfly <b>valves,</b> <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.|$|R
50|$|Commentators {{observe that}} the South Devon system omitted the iron weather flap {{that was used}} on the Dalkey line to cover the <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> On that line iron plates were turned away {{immediately}} ahead of the piston bracket. It is not recorded why this was omitted in South Devon, but at speed that arrangement must have involved considerable mechanical force, and generated environmental noise.|$|E
50|$|Jacob and Joseph Samuda were shipbuilders and {{engineer}}s, {{and owned}} the Southwark Ironworks; {{they were both}} members of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Samuel Clegg was a gas engineer and they worked in collaboration on their atmospheric system. About 1835 they read Medhurst's writings, and developed a small bore vacuum pipe system. Clegg worked on a longitudinal <b>flap</b> <b>valve,</b> for sealing the slot in the pipe.|$|E
50|$|On vintage cars you {{may find}} a bellows type thermostat, which has a {{corrugated}} bellows containing a volatile liquid such as alcohol or acetone. These types of thermostats do not work well at cooling system pressures above about 7 psi. Modern motor vehicles typically run at around 15 psi, which precludes {{the use of the}} bellows type thermostat. On direct air-cooled engines this is not a concern for the bellows thermostat that controls a <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> in the air passages.|$|E
50|$|Drains of {{all sizes}} can be fitted with systems {{available}} with extension brackets that cater for drain depths from 500 mm to over 2.5m deep.There are also pneumatically controllable <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> or pneumatically controlled non-return valves which can be fitted to existing soil waste systems.

The side of the <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> facing the flow opening and the fixing point between the <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> and the base structure have an insulating coating (17), for electrically insulating the <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> from the base structure, so that an operating voltage can be applied between them. USE - Bistable microvalve e. g. for fluids, including gas. ADVANTAGE - Requires relatively small operating voltage for closure of valve...|$|R
50|$|Oil spills in 1982 and, more {{severely}} in 1985, led to de-oxygenation of the marsh. The vegetation {{came to be}} dominated by Scirpus maritimus, a rush that could withstand the salty conditions, though the re-discovery of a rare species of grass following some works on the drainage enhanced the conservation status of the marsh. In response the <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> were removed, allowing a free flow of salt water that is rich in oxygen.|$|R
50|$|If the atrial septum {{does not}} close properly, {{it leads to}} a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This type of defect {{generally}} works like a <b>flap</b> <b>valve,</b> opening during certain conditions of increased pressure in the chest, such as during strain while having a bowel movement, cough, or sneeze. With enough pressure, blood may travel from the right atrium to the left. If there is a clot in {{the right side of}} the heart, it can cross the PFO, enter the left atrium, and travel out of the heart and to the brain, causing a stroke. If the clot travels into a coronary artery it can cause a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|Water {{will always}} try to find its lowest level. Using this principle, very simple pumps with plastic or rubber bulb with <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> at each end are used for {{emptying}} fuel or water cans into tanks. Once the bulb is full, the fluid will flow without further effort from the higher to the lower container. Many hand pumps will allow the passage of fluid through them {{in the direction of}} flow and diaphragm pumps are particularly good at this. Thus where the levels are correct large volumes of liquid such as swimming pools can be emptied with very little effort and no expensive energy use.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1847-1848 the leather <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> that sealed the {{traction}} pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter the leather froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly {{after the passage of}} a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer there was hot and dry weather and the leather valve dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had the leather treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the tannin in the leather and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with the leather cup seal on the pistons.|$|E

5000|$|Grazing marshes {{were created}} from Medieval times by {{building}} sea walls (earth banks) across tidal mudflats and salt marsh to make polders (though the term [...] "polder" [...] is little used in Britain). Polders in Britain are mostly drained by gravity, rather than active pumping. The original tidal drainage channels were augmented by new ditches, and <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> {{in the sea}} walls let water drain out at low tide and prevent the sea or tidal river from entering at high tide. Constructing polders {{in this way is}} called inning or reclaiming from the sea.|$|R
50|$|In 1799, he {{set down}} {{the concept of the}} modern {{aeroplane}} as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control. On a small silver disc dated that year, he engraved on one side the forces acting on an aircraft and on the other a sketch of an aircraft design incorporating such modern features as a cambered wing, separate tail comprising a horizontal tailplane and vertical fin, and fuselage for the pilot suspended below the center of gravity to provide stability. The design is not yet wholly modern, incorporating as it does two pilot-operated paddles or oars which appear to work as <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The chanter is {{the part}} of the uilleann pipes that is used to play the melody. It has eight finger holes (example given of a D pitched chanter): bottom D, E, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, high D (also called [...] "back D"). To achieve the bottom D (D4) the chanter is lifted off the knee, exposing the exit of the chanter's bore, where the note is produced. The chanter is set on the right knee thus closing off the bottom hole. Many players use a strip of leather placed over the knee, called a [...] "popping strap", which {{provides}} for an airtight seal. More rarely, a simple gravity- or spring-operated <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> attached {{to the bottom of the}} chanter achieves the same end. Generally, for all other notes (except for special effects, or to vary the volume and tone) the chanter stays on the knee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{summer of}} 1846 was {{exceptionally}} hot and dry, and serious difficulties with the traction pipe <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> started to show themselves. It {{was essential to}} make a good seal when the leather flap was closed, and the weather conditions made the leather stiff. As for the tallow and beeswax compound that was supposed to seal the joint after every train, Samuda had originally said [...] "this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it" [...] and the hot weather had that effect. Samuda's original description of his system had included a metal weather valve that closed over the flap, but this had been omitted on the L&CR, exposing the valve to the weather, and also encouraging the ingestion of debris, including, an observer reported, a handkerchief dropped by a lady on to the track. Any debris lodging in the seating of the flap could only have reduced its effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|On the 32 and 320, {{the engine}} exhaust exits above the waterline, usually via a rubber <b>flap</b> <b>valve,</b> {{and with no}} marine {{silencer}} used in the system {{due to lack of}} space available. Partly in order to offer some degree of attenuation of the (noticeable) exhaust booming noise, a characteristic of Corvettes, the latest 340 models have specially built 90 degree GRP exhaust elbows fitted to allow the engine exhaust to exit under water. These elbows have a small by-pass outlet with a flapper valve to prevent back flow. Also, the shape of the underside section is designed to promote suction to ensure that back pressure is within limits. To accommodate the underwater exhaust outlet, the trim tabs had to be cut away locally. Also on the 340, a fixed cavitation plate was added on the centreline between the trim tabs, {{as an extension of the}} hull lower surface. This fixed âinterceptorâ type trim tab helped bring the bow down at speed to improve the running angle and trim.|$|E

The system generally includes an open-ended ventricular catheter with drainage apertures and safety <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> a reservoir with inline filter, and a peritoneal catheter. After insertion, for example into the ventricles of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid would pass into the ventricular catheter, through the inline filter in the reservoir, and into the peritoneal catheter, subsequently exiting the shunt catheter system. During insertion of the ventricular catheter, a catheter stylet or wire/string and plug stylet can be positioned therein to occlude the open end. The ventricular catheter may be positioned perpendicular to the peritoneal catheter and can be coupled to one another through the reservoir and inline filter or valve...|$|R
50|$|Double dump valves, {{also known}} as double <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> or double <b>flap</b> gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double dump valves are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double dump valves are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for controlling}} vehicles which are moved through a conduit by air {{and includes a}} processing system positioned in the conduit for collecting, storage and dispatching the vehicles in which an air pump is positioned in parallel with the processing system having its suction connected to the conduit upstream {{of the system and}} its discharge connected to the conduit downstream of the system. Valve means are connected to the conduit for reducing the tendency of the vehicles in the processing system to move upstream towards the pump suction. The valve means alternates the pressure in a portion of the processing system between less than atmospheric and at least atmospheric. One form of the valve means may include an air blocking vehicle stop movable {{into and out of the}} conduit and a valve connected between the conduit and the atmosphere upstream of the vehicle stop which is open and closed in synchronism with the vehicle stop. In addition, a second valve may be connected between the conduit and the pump suction upstream of the air blocking vehicle stop for speeding up the vehicle processing. In another embodiment, first and second swingable <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> may be positioned in the conduit in the upstream portion of the processing system with an air flow control connected to the pump suction and positioned for alternately withdrawing air from the conduit upstream of each of the first and second valves for allowing the vehicles to pass through the <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> but preventing the application of the pump suction to the conduit downstream of the second valve.

50|$|Once {{the safety}} pin is pulled, the grenade is live but {{so long as}} the fly-off lever is kept {{depressed}} while the grenade is held (and the grenade can be held indefinitely with the pin out) it can be safely returned to storage {{so long as the}} fly-off safety lever is still in the closed position and the safety pin reinserted. However if thrown - or the lever allowed to rise - the protective plastic cover falls away and the striker, under pressure of the striker spring, begins to rotate on its axis. This causes the safety lever to be thrown clear, the striker continues to rotate until it hits the percussion cap, which fires and ignites the delay pellet. The heat of the burning delay pellet melts solder holding a retaining ring, allowing the detonator to move under the influence of a spring from the safe to armed position. The delay pellet continues to burn and after between 3 and 4 seconds burns out and produces a flash that forces aside a <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> allowing ignition. When the flash reaches the detonator this initiates a booster charge which in turn initiates the main explosive filling.|$|E
5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Attempts at man-powered flight still persisted. Paucton's {{rotorcraft}} was man-powered, {{while another}} approach, also originally studied by da Vinci, {{was the use}} of flap valves. The <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> is a simple hinged flap over a hole in the wing. In one direction it opens to allow air through and in the other it closes to allow an increased pressure difference. An early example was designed by Bauer in 1764. Later in 1808, Jacob Degen built an ornithopter with flap valves, in which the pilot stood on a rigid frame and worked the wings with a movable horizontal bar. His 1809 attempt at flight failed, so he then added a small hydrogen balloon and the combination achieved some short hops. Popular illustrations of the day depicted his machine without the balloon, leading to confusion as to what had actually flown. In 1811, Albrecht Berblinger built an ornithopter based on Degen's design but omitted the balloon, plunging instead into the Danube. The fiasco did have an upside: George Cayley, also taken in by the illustrations, was spurred to publish his findings to date [...] "for the sake of giving a little more dignity to a subject bordering upon the ludicrous in public estimation", and the modern era of aviation was born.|$|E

All Javelins came with thin-shell bucket seats and a fully carpeted interior, while the SST model had additional appearance and comfort items that included reclining front seat backs, simulated wood grained door panel trim, and a sports-style steering wheel. The Javelin's instruments and controls were set deep in a padded panel, with the rest of the dashboard was set well forward, away from the passenger.|$|R
5000|$|He advertised a {{new design}} of [...] "valveless air compressor" [...] {{which he made}} on licence from the patentee, Edmund Edwards. By 1889, {{he was working on}} an engine design which would not {{infringe}} the patents that Otto had on the four-stroke, and that he eventually called the Valveless Two-Stroke Engine. In fact there were two <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> in Joseph Day's original design, one in the inlet port, where you would probably find a reed valve on a modern two stroke, and one in the crown of the piston, because he did not come {{up with the idea of}} the transfer ports until a couple of years later. He made about 250 of these first two-port motors, fitting them to small generating sets, which won a prize at the International Electrical Exhibition in 1892.|$|R
500|$|Razor shells can dig {{themselves}} into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the <b>flapping</b> <b>valves</b> in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|R
