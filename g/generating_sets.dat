40|$|Abstract. A module M over a ring R is said {{to satisfy}} (P) if every gen-erating set of M {{contains}} an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The following results are proved; (1) Let τ = (Tτ,Fτ) be a hereditary torsion theory such that Tτ 6 = Mod-R. Then every τ-torsionfree R-module satisfies (P) {{if and only if}} S = R/τ(R) is a division ring. (2) Let K be a hereditary pre-torsion class of modules. Then every module in K satisfies (P) if and only if either K = { 0 } or S = R/SocK(R) is a division ring, where SocK(R) = ∩{I ≤ RR: R/I ∈ K}. For a right R-moduleM, a subset X ofM {{is said to}} be a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> ofM if M = Σx∈XxR; and a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> Y of M such that no proper subset of Y can generate M. A <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> X of M is called an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> if Σx∈XxR = ⊕x∈XxR. Clearly, every independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> but the converse is not true in general. For example, the set { 2, 3 } is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of ZZ but not an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It is well-known that every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a right vector space over a division ring contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (or a basis). This motivated various interests in characterizing the rings R such that every module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> or every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of each module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (see, for example, [2], [8], [9], [11]). In [2, Theorem 2. 3], the authors proved that R is a division ring if and only if every R-module has a basis if and only if every irredundant subset of an R-module is independent. This result can be considered in a more general context of a torsion theory. For anR-moduleM,M is said to satisfy (P) if ever...|$|R
5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet {{the demand for}} power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E

500|$|Following a {{visit to}} the station by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 3 July 2009, it became {{apparent}} that Rio Tinto Alcan were hoping to be able to demonstrate Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology at the station in the future, using [...] "pre-combustion" [...] CCS technology. This would have involved treating the coal prior to burning so that less CO2 was produced, with any remaining CO2 being pumped under the North Sea into an aquifer. However, due to the economic climate, Rio Tinto did not commit the funding for the project themselves, and did not secure any of the required £1billion European Union funding available for demonstration of CCS technology. In November 2009 it was announced that a variety of energy experts were preparing for the £1billion bid to the Government for investment. The plans included a pipeline into the North Sea, and the upgrading of one of the station's <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> from 140MW to around 375MW, to safeguard the supply of electricity to the aluminium smelter.|$|E
500|$|Coal is {{fed into}} one of 30 coal bunkers, each with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 tonnes. Each bunker feeds two of the 60 pulverisers, each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour. [...] The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane. In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (HP) turbine, one intermediate pressure (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. The HP turbines generate at 140 megawatts (MW). Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660MW: with six <b>generating</b> <b>sets,</b> the station has a total capacity of 3,960MW.

Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F.

D., Department of Algebra Abstract: By a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a module we mean a subset which generates the module but {{any of its}} proper subsets does not. If the module is not finitely generated, an {{existence}} of a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> is not guaranteed. We say that a module is weakly based {{if it has a}} minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> In the presented thesis, we provide a characterization of weakly based modules over Dedekind domains. As an application of this, we show that the class of weakly based modules is not closed under extensions and the complement of this class is not closed under finite direct sums. Also, we show an example of an abelian group which is weakly based if and only if CH holds. Then we treat rings such that all modules are weakly based. We prove that a Baer regular ring has this property if and only if it is semisimple, and we show that any ℵ 0 -noetherian commutative semiartinian ring has this property.
