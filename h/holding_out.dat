5|$|After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> in Arnhem {{for four}} nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition was now in short supply {{and most of the}} men had not eaten for over twenty-four hours.|$|E
5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his command bunker, so {{even though he was}} able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 McNeill was a holdout from Chargers camp. He {{ended his}} <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> on September 25 and {{reported}} to the San Diego Chargers. A few days after ending his <b>hold</b> <b>out,</b> McNeill and the Chargers agreed to a 6-year, $48.895 million deal.|$|R

5|$|Dunstaffnage saw action {{during the}} Civil War, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> against Montrose's army in 1644. The castle was burned by royalist troops, {{following}} {{the failure of}} the rising of the 9th Earl of Argyll in 1685, against the Catholic James VII. During the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, the castle was occupied by government troops. Flora MacDonald, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape from Scotland, was briefly imprisoned here while en route to imprisonment in London.|$|E
5|$|Mine owners still <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> for the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners {{not to interfere}} with the operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially {{attempted to}} persuade these men to join the union and strike, but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.|$|E
5|$|On 25 and 26 May, the Luftwaffe {{focused their}} {{attention}} on Allied pockets <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> at Calais, Lille, and Amiens, and did not attack Dunkirk. Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May. Remnants of the French First Army, surrounded at Lille, fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender, having run out of food and ammunition.|$|E
60|$|And north, at York, in {{the rear}} of those three insurrections lay Gospatrick, Waltheof, and Marlesweyn, with the Northumbrian host. Durham was lost, and Comyn burnt therein.

5|$|On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors {{surrounded}} Fort Presque Isle (on {{the site}} of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, {{on the condition that}} they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.|$|E
5|$|The corps was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General George S. Patton's Third Army on 10 October 1944, and moved to Etain, near Verdun, and into combat. The corps' first fighting was for the Metz region, as it was moved to attack Fort Jeanne d'Arc, {{one of the last}} forts <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> in the region. That fort fell on 13 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Vicksburg was {{the last}} major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, {{capturing}} it completed {{the second part of}} the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. When two major assaults (May 19 and 22, 1863) against the Confederate fortifications were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> for more than forty days, with no reinforcement and supplies nearly gone, the garrison finally surrendered on July 4.|$|E

50|$|After his {{performance}} in 1944, Gentry believed he was entitled to a $1,000 raise. Detroit's general manager Jack Zeller refused, and Gentry opted to <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b> The <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> lasted the entire 1945 season. Gentry reportedly offered to sign in August, but Zeller felt Gentry was out of shape {{and told him to}} stay home.|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|Beaumaris Castle {{was taken}} by Welsh forces in 1403 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr, but was recaptured by royal forces in 1405. Following {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. Despite forming part of a local royalist rebellion in 1648 the castle escaped slighting and was garrisoned by Parliament, but fell into ruin around 1660, eventually forming part of a local stately home and park in the 19th century. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{at the bridge}} had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still <b>holding</b> <b>out,</b> and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, {{what was left of the}} brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failed}} landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation, the {{commander}} of the Australian II Corps, Savige, decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were <b>holding</b> <b>out.</b> In order to concentrate enough forces for the next phase of the operation, Savige decided that the 11th Brigade, which had been carrying the advance north, should be relieved so that it could be transferred to the south following a period of rest and reorganisation.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. In the aftermath the castle was partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further revolt, and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and lead was stripped and sold off. Conwy Castle became an attractive destination for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Visitor numbers grew and initial restoration work was carried out {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The Eric Lindros {{trade was}} the {{culmination}} of a holdout by Eric Lindros from the Quebec Nordiques of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Nordiques selected Lindros in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft with the first overall selection, but Lindros refused to play for them. After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> from Quebec for a year, the Nordiques agreed to two trades involving Lindros {{at the onset of the}} 1992 NHL Entry Draft, one with the Philadelphia Flyers and one with the New York Rangers. An arbitrator ruled in favor of the Flyers on June 30, 1992.|$|E

5|$|The General Strike {{had begun}} as a dispute between miners and their {{employers}} outside London in 1925. On 1 May 1926 the Trades Union Congress called out workers {{all over the}} country, including the London dockers. The government had had over a year to prepare and deployed troops to break the dockers' picket lines. Armed food convoys, accompanied by armoured cars, drove down the East India Dock Road. By 10 May, a meeting was brokered at Toynbee Hall to end the strike. The TUC were forced into a humiliating climbdown and the general strike ended on 11 May, with the miners <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> until November.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it {{difficult}} to make further progress. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> in the occupied parts of the country. Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons {{to come back to}} his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons. The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to {{alleviate}} {{the pressure on the}} French to the south and believing there might still be some <b>holding</b> <b>out,</b> high command ordered the 2nd and 55th divisions to resume the battle on the 9th. The attack failed and proved to be ill-prepared and disorganised, with an identical starting time and objectives. For his actions during the battle, Captain Chavasse, attached to the Liverpool Scottish, gained the first of two VCs for attending to and rescuing wounded in no man's land. The village would not be captured until the final struggle began on 3 September, by which time the 12th was the King's only contribution, and the regiment had more than 3,000 casualties.|$|E
