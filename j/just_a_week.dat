The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee.|$|E

However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} estimating {{the number of}} riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).|$|E

5|$|After the war, Pierlot {{joined the}} Catholic Party (Parti catholique), the main centre-right party in Belgium {{and one of}} the three that {{dominated}} Belgian political life. The Catholic Party, which was considered the party of stability and the establishment, was extremely electorally successful during the interwar period and headed a series of coalition governments. On 23 December 1925, Pierlot entered parliament {{as a member of the}} Chamber of Deputies representing Neufchâteau-Virton but left <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later to become a senator. He served as provincial senator for Luxembourg from 1926 to 1936 and as directly elected senator for the same province between 1936 and 1946.

5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. Jasmine also brought rainfall to {{areas of the}} Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular {{are affected by the}} cyclone. Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{performed}} well and took on more administrative responsibilities {{once he was}} promoted to Corporal on 20 November 1914. During this period, the First Battle of Ypres was being fought and the Squadron re-equipped with the higher performing Morane-Saulnier L aircraft. Several months later, on 1 April 1915, {{he was promoted to}} sergeant and made NCO in charge of all engines in his flight. McCudden's delight at gaining a promotion was cut short by news that his brother William had been killed in an air crash while flying an elderly Blériot. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later, his eldest sister Mary lost her husband in an explosion which destroyed the minelayer HMS Princess Irene on 27 May 1915.|$|E

The airline gained approval to join the alliance from the India's Ministry of Civil Aviation and started participating in the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product. However, on 3 February 2012, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> before {{it was due to}} join the alliance, Kingfisher Airlines' entry was put on hold to give it more time to strengthen its financial position.

5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for 1998–99, he signed athletic Derby centre-back Matt Carbon for £800,000, Blackpool striker James Quinn for £500,000, and Manchester City defender Jason van Blerk for £50,000. He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, {{the player who}} had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith's arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith's signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them ending up in 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{before the start of}} 1999–2000.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> after Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization {{advised the}} general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E
