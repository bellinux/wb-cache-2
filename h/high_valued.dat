This was before the gold strikes in California were confirmed and she left with only a partial passenger load in her 60 saloon (about $300 fare) and 150 steerage (about $150 fare) passenger compartments. Only a few were {{going all the way}} to California. As word of the gold strikes spread, the [...] picked up more passengers in Valparaiso Chile and Panama City Panama and showed up in San Francisco on 28 February 1849. She was loaded with about 400 gold seeking passengers; twice the number of passengers it had been designed for. In San Francisco all her passengers and crew except the captain and one man deserted the ship and it would take the Captain two more months to gather a much better paid return crew to return to Panama city an establish the route they had been contracted for. Many more paddle steamers were soon running from the east coast cities to the Chagres River in Panama and the San Juan River in Nicaragua. By the mid 1850s there were over ten Pacific and ten Atlantic/Caribbean paddle wheel steamboats shuttling <b>high</b> <b>valued</b> freight like passengers, gold and mail between California and both the Pacific and Caribbean ports. The trip to the east coast could be executed after about 1850 in as short as 40 days if all ship connections could be met with a minimum of waiting.|$|E

40|$|The {{formalism}} {{for evaluating}} first strike costs and incentives for military targeting generalize to include <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> targets. That introduces two new allocations {{to the usual}} allocation between missiles and military targets, {{but they can be}} performed analytically. As the number of weapons on each side decreases, the optimal fraction of second strike weapons allocated to military values falls. The shift to <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets is more pronounced below about 1, 000 weapons for nominal parameters. Below 500 weapons the first striker's cost of action drops below its cost of inaction. A strike would induce a second strike of about 250 weapons on <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets. An increase in the first striker's preference for damage to the other's <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets increases or a decrease in its preference for preventing damage to its own <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets decreases first strike costs and stability margins. Including defenses complicates allocations slightly. The main effect is increased attrition of second strikes, particularly at larger defenses, which makes it possible to significantly reduce damage to <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets. At 1, 000 weapons, by 300 to 400 interceptors the first striker's costs are reduced to 30 % below that of inaction and the number of weapons delivered on the first striker's <b>high</b> <b>value</b> targets is reduced to about 100...|$|R
