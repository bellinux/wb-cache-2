40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings on}} the need for traveler information among people with <b>functional</b> <b>limitation(s),</b> and how the need varies between groups with different <b>functional</b> <b>limitation(s).</b> Chi-Squared Automatic Identification Detector (CHAID) was used to identify groups (segments) in order to understand how <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> contribute to the need for traveler information. The key findings suggest that people with <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> have a greater need for traveler information concerning different aspects of travel beyond traveler information that relates to their functional limitation(s); this greater need also relates to groups of people with covert <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> to which little consideration is usually given.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between self-reported and professionally assessed <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> in community-dwelling very old individuals. In total, 306 single-living adults aged 81 - 90 years were included in this cross-sectional study. The main outcome measure was the presence and absence of self-reported and professionally assessed <b>functional</b> <b>limitations.</b> A significant correlation was found between the total number of self-reported and professionally assessed <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> in the total sample (intraclass correlation= 0. 65) as well as in subgroups with respect to sex, age, and depression. When item-wise differences in the two assessments were assessed, the results showed significant differences for nine of the 15 <b>functional</b> <b>limitations.</b> In general, the participants reported more <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> as present than the professional did. In conclusion, research on self-reported and professionally assessed <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> contributes toward the understanding of how different modes of data collection influence the results.

However, these measures often do not clearly differentiate between <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> and daily performance of an activity. METHODS. We measured the differences between self-reported disability and observed <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> in six activities of daily living tasks among community-dwelling elders. The value of <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> vs disability measures in determining risk factors for disablement was ascertained. RESULTS. Systematic differences were found among the 1453 participants. At least 89 % of the time when a difference was identified, the subjects ranked disability greater than the <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> observed. For those who were cognitively impaired, discrepancies occurred up to 11 % of the time. In determining risk factors for disablement, we found that neurological impairments were associated with both <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> and disability, while sociocultural factors were associated with disability only. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest that physical <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> and disability in the elderly are two distinct concepts and that the measure of choice should be determined by research objectives and the type of population being studied...|$|R

40|$|A {{model was}} {{proposed}} {{to assess the}} premise that <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> are an intermediary stage between risk factors (e. g., sex and frequency of walking a mile), pathology/impairments (e. g., musculoskeletal problems), and the onset and course of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) disability. Analyses were based on two random subsamples (each with n = 524) of Longitudinal Study of Aging respondents who were nondisabled at baseline (1984) and reinterviewed in 1988 and 1990. The model's central premise was supported in two ways. The main influence of age, frequency of walking, and musculoskeletal problems was on the onset of <b>functional</b> <b>limitations,</b> rather than the onset of IADL disability. And, onset of lower body <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> influenced future disability (1990) through its relationship with disability in 1988 and <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> in 1990. The results underscore the value of clinical trials which focus on minimizing <b>functional</b> <b>limitations</b> as a strategy for preventing disability.

50|$|The {{social model}} of {{disability}} is {{a reaction to}} the dominant medical model of disability which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.

50|$|Second {{messengers}} are intracellular signaling molecules {{released by}} the cell to trigger physiological changes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and apoptosis. Secondary messengers are therefore one of the initiating components of intracellular signal transduction cascades. Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and calcium. The cell releases second messenger molecules in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules—the first messengers. First messengers are extracellular factors, often hormones or neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine, growth hormone, and serotonin. Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules, these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly—unlike steroid hormones, which usually do. This <b>functional</b> <b>limitation</b> necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers, so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly. An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify {{the strength of the}} original first messenger signal. For example, RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB.|$|E

To {{determine}} {{prevalence and}} prevalence ratio of <b>functional</b> <b>limitation</b> amongst older people with combined chronic diseases and co-morbid depressive symptoms compared with older people with either chronic disease or depressive symptoms alone. Methods. Data were analysed from a cross-sectional study of 765 people aged 60 years and over, conducted from 2007 to 2008 in Malaysia.

Of 638 former Buruli ulcer patients (of 678 individuals examined), sufficient items on daily activities (13 of the 19) were applicable to calculate a score. To determine the validity, the <b>functional</b> <b>limitation</b> scores of the 638 individuals were compared with the global impression of the limitations, range of motion (ROM), and the social impact (change of occupation or education) of Buruli ulcer.

Both global impression and ROM correlated well with the <b>functional</b> <b>limitation</b> scores (0. 66 and 0. 61). The inter-observer reliability of 107 participants as measured by an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0. 86 was very good.
