5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

Meanwhile, Don Geiss (Torn) wakes up from his coma only to inform Jack of his decision to remain CEO of General Electric (GE). At the same time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> by NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) when he gets more laughs {{than they do in}} the elevator.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> or sense danger, they may try to escape by {{climbing}} a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves. A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E

25|$|Body and shinai {{will lose}} balance as you strike or when being attacked. This {{technique}} {{takes advantage of}} this to help execute a strike. A good example is Hikibana-kote, when a strike is made to an opponent's kote as they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> and raise their kensen as you push forward.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} danger to people from moose is car collisions. From 1995 to 2006, {{there was an}} average of one collision a year of a moose and an automobile across the state, although {{in the first half}} of 2007, there were four, including one in June on the Merritt Parkway in Stamford. Unlike deer, moose that <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> tend to stand their ground.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some debate about whether hognoses are venomous. Their saliva meets the {{definition}} of a venom since it is toxic to small prey such as frogs and toads; however, it is not likely to cause serious injury to humans, particularly as hognoses are rear-fanged and although they will generally feign a strike they will bite if they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{design of}} the car was proceeding, Hayek feared {{existing}} manufacturers would <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> by the Swatchmobile. Thus, rather than directly competing, he preferred to cooperate with another company in the automotive industry. This would also relieve SMH of the cost burden in setting up a distribution network. Hayek approached several automotive manufacturers and on July 3, 1991, he reached an agreement with Volkswagen to share development of the new project.|$|E

25|$|Nesting {{most often}} occurs at night for {{protection}} from predators. The prime season for nesting is from December to June, butr peak months are January through March. Females are uneasy when coming ashore. If they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened,</b> they return to the water and wait until the shore is safer. Approximately two months after nesting the hatchlings emerge. They are around 46mm long when hatched, smaller than other Chelonia hatchlings.|$|E
25|$|Male {{southern}} house spiders sometimes appear aggressive, {{but they}} do not bite unless trapped, and their mouthparts are too small to easily penetrate human skin. They do, however, have an unnerving tendency to crawl across anything in their path regardless of whether it is alive. This is not aggression; these spiders are simply nearly blind and cannot see larger animals. Indeed, these spiders instinctively play dead if they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> (a tactic which is effective against their common predators).|$|E
25|$|While all wasp stings are unpleasant, {{the sting}} of R. romandi is known for being very painful. Additionally, because R. romandi is a paper wasp, it {{has the ability to}} {{repeatedly}} sting without dying. R. romandi is most aggressive if they are swarming, if their nests are disturbed or if the wasps feel their nest is threatened. If wasps <b>feel</b> <b>threatened,</b> they may swarm out of the nest, and pursue the aggressor. If you ever get swarmed by wasps, it is recommended that you remain as still as possible and move away slowly. Sudden movements will be regarded as aggressive acts and will result in more stings.|$|E

25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened.</b> Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} for only Manchus to conquer southern China, Ming Han Chinese armies conquered the territory for them. Three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a great role in the conquest of southern China were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde, who then governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing. Wu, Geng, and Shang's son, Shang Zhixin, in the early 1660s began to <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> by the increasing control from the north, and decided they {{had no choice but to}} revolt. The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Emperor Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China from which it took several decades to recover.|$|E
25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they <b>feel</b> <b>threatened.</b> These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

500|$|The game's world {{design and}} {{atmosphere}} received great critical reviews. Many critics {{agreed that the}} game had successfully built up tension through the game's conversations between characters and the resource management mechanics, which enables players to <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> {{by the state of}} the world. The world was thought to be more [...] "alive" [...] than its predecessor, and critics praised the development team for creating distinct locations, and turning typical gritty colors featured in many games into something refreshing and stunning. The depiction of the world and 4A's vision of an apocalypse was applauded for delivering a sense of sadness and desperation. The game's attention to detail was widely praised, and the surface area, in particular, was applauded. Critics thought that these sequences offered visual variety, and some [...] "genuine terror" [...] moments. Jim Sterling from Destructoid singled out the game's multiple flashback scenes, which he described as [...] "harrowing".|$|E
500|$|Racism, an {{important}} theme {{in all of}} Angelou's autobiographies, continues {{to be important in}} this book, but she has matured in the way she deals with it in Traveling Shoes. [...] For the first time in Angelou's life, she [...] "does not <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. [...] She finds a strong support system there, and as Hagen states, she [...] "has come far from the mute, shy little girl of Stamps, Arkansas". [...] As Hagen states, Angelou [...] "is not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". [...] This is demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that is often overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. [...] Angelou is taught {{an important}} lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compares it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts, even the efforts of Shirley Graham DuBois, whom Angelou resents, is needed.|$|E
