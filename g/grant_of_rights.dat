Although the case was {{adjudicated}} in 1302, the resulting decision was overturned. In 1304 Braose secured King Edward's confirmation of earlier grants and charters granting Braose special rights and liberties in Gower. [...] He managed this because he was serving the king in Scotland at the time, and thus had easy access to the king. In 1305, however, Braose miscalculated and insulted a royal judge, using [...] "gross and contumelious words" [...] to describe the royal official. This episode caused the case of Gower to be reopened in 1306, and Braose was only able to settle the issue again by the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to his men in Swansea and Gower.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{force had}} {{a core of}} units which were both {{professional}} and disciplined. It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangians, the Athanatoi, a unit of heavy cavalry stationed in Constantinople, the Vardariotai and the Archontopouloi, recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers, foreign mercenary regiments, and also units of professional soldiers recruited from the provinces. These provincial troops included kataphraktoi cavalry from Macedonia, Thessaly, Thrace, and various other provincial forces. Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state the Komnenian army included the armed followers {{of members of the}} wider imperial family and its extensive connections. In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military. The granting of pronoia was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure {{towards the end of the}} Komnenian period, though it became much more important subsequently. The pronoia was essentially the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to receive revenue from a particular area of land, a form of tax farming, and it was held in return for military obligations, ...|$|E

In examining the negotiations with the Yakama nation, which was the largest of the Indian tribes, the District Court found that, [...] "At the treaty council the United States negotiators promised, and the Indians understood, that the Yakamas would forever be able to continue the same off-reservation food gathering and fishing practices as to time, place, method, species and extent as they had or were exercising." [...] In writing for the majority, Justice McKenna stated that a “Treaty between the United States and the Indians... is not a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to the Indians, but a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> from them - a reservation of those granted." [...] This established {{for the first time the}} so-called [...] "reserved rights" [...] doctrine in American Indian law. The Court noted the historical and traditional importance of fishing and hunting to the Indians, and viewed these rights as part of a larger bundle of rights preserved under the treaty.|$|E

The Supreme Court has ruled that [...] "Treaties are to be construed as a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> from the Indians, not to them - and a reservation of those not granted."
