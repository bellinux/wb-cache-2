[...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox.

500|$|The episode's {{reference}} to A Clockwork Orange {{was named the}} 10th-greatest film reference {{in the history of}} the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.

2500|$|With {{any large}} number of people being in close {{quarters}} there was a constant threat of disease. [...] When one individual in a large group <b>gets</b> <b>sick</b> with a communicable disease, it spreads to others very quickly. [...] This premise remains true even today in the modern military. [...] The Romans recognized the difference between disease and wounds, each requiring separate treatment. [...] Drainage of excess water and waste were common practices in camps as well as the permanent medical structures, which come at a later date. [...] As the medical corps grew in size there was also specialization evolving. Physicians surfaced that specialized in disease, surgery, wound dressing and even veterinary medicine. Veterinary physicians were there to tend to livestock for agricultural purposes as well as combat purposes. [...] The Cavalry was known for their use of horses in combat and scouting purposes. [...] Because of the type of injuries that would have been commonly seen, surgery was a somewhat common occurrence. [...] Tools such as scissors, knives and arrow extractors have been found in remains. [...] In fact, Roman surgery was quite intuitive, in contrast to common thought of ancient surgery. [...] The Roman military surgeons used a cocktail of plants, which created a sedative similar to modern anesthesia. [...] Written documentation also showed surgeons would use oxidation from metal such as copper and scrape it into wounds, which provided an antibacterial effect; however, this method was most likely more toxic than providing an actual benefit. [...] Doctors had the knowledge to clean their surgical instruments with hot water after each use. [...] Wounds were dressed, and dead tissue was removed when bandages were changed. [...] Honey and cobwebs were items used to cover wounds, and have even been shown today to increase healing. [...] Because of the wide array of cases, it was not uncommon for surgeons to begin their careers in the army to learn their trade. [...] Physicians such as Galen and Dioscorides served in the military. [...] Most major advancements in knowledge and technique came from the military rather than civil practice.|$|E
