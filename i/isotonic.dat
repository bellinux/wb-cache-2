5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for <b>isotonic</b> nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium. For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the <b>isotonic</b> nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. <b>Isotonic</b> loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally <b>isotonic</b> to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually <b>isotonic</b> saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{medications}} for lung barotrauma are oxygen, oxygen-helium or nitrox, <b>isotonic</b> fluids, anti-inflammatory medications, decongestants, and analgesics.|$|E
25|$|Volume {{expanders}} {{may either}} be <b>isotonic,</b> hypotonic, or hypertonic. Hypotonic fluids are not generally recommended in children {{due to increased}} risk of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which {{is close to the}} concentration in the blood (<b>isotonic).</b> Lactated Ringer's (also known as Ringer's lactate) and the closely related Ringer's acetate, are mildly hypotonic solutions often used in those who have significant burns.|$|E
25|$|Pre-hospital {{care for}} lung {{barotrauma}} includes basic life support of maintaining adequate oxygenation and perfusion, assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, neurological assessment, and managing any immediate life-threatening conditions. High-flow oxygen up to 100% is considered appropriate for diving accidents. Large-bore venous access with <b>isotonic</b> fluid infusion is recommended to maintain {{blood pressure and}} pulse.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, lactate {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{components}} of lactated Ringer's solution and Hartmann's solution. These intravenous fluids consist of sodium and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water, generally in concentrations <b>isotonic</b> with human blood. It is most commonly used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or burns.|$|E
25|$|Treatment usually {{involves}} resuscitation with intravenous fluid therapy, usually {{a combination of}} <b>isotonic</b> fluids and hypertonic saline or a colloidal solution such as hetastarch, and emergency surgery. The stomach is initially decompressed by passing a stomach tube, or if that is not possible, trocars can be passed through the skin into the stomach to remove the gas, alternatively the trocars may be inserted directly into the stomach following anaesthesia {{in order to reduce}} the chances of infection. During surgery, the stomach is placed back into its correct position, the abdomen is examined for any devitalized tissue (especially the stomach and spleen). A partial gastrectomy may be necessary if there is any necrosis of the stomach wall.|$|E
25|$|While nasal {{irrigation}} can {{be carried}} out using ordinary tap water, this is potentially unsafe and can be uncomfortable because it irritates the mucous membranes. Therefore, an <b>isotonic</b> or hypertonic salt water solution is normally used, i.e. water with enough salt to match the tonicity of the body cells and blood. For the same reason, lukewarm water is preferred over cold water, which in addition to irritating nasal membranes can also exaggerate the gag reflex during irrigation. Use of distilled, sterile or previously boiled and cooled water over ordinary tap water is advised. A small amount of baking soda is sometimes employed as a buffering agent to neutralize the pH of the irrigating solution.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Ohio {{approved}} {{the use of}} an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of hydromorphone (a 333-fold overdose for an opioid-naïve patient of this narcotic analgesic closely related to and five times stronger than morphine; this is the equivalent of an entire 50-ml bottle of Dilaudid HP, the most powerful commercially available form, although the advantage of hydromorphone is its very high solubility allowing for solutions of almost arbitrary concentration; 500 mg of hydromorphone HCl as pure powder can be dissolved in <b>isotonic</b> saline in volumes as small as under 2 cc) and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.|$|E

2500|$|Kinsey, in his 1953 book Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, {{stated that}} {{exercise}} could bring about sexual pleasure, including orgasm.

[...] A 2007 review {{of the relationship between}} pelvic floor dysfunction and sexual problems in men and women found that they are commonly linked and suggested that physical therapy strengthening the pelvic floor could help address the sexual problems but that it was not well studied enough to recommend.

[...] The paper was widely discussed in popular media when it was published. [...] The authors of the paper said that research on the relationship between exercise and sexual response was still lacking.|$|E
50|$|In an <b>isotonic</b> contraction, tension {{remains the}} same, whilst the muscle's length changes. <b>Isotonic</b> contractions differ from {{isokinetic}} contractions in that in isokinetic contractions the muscle speed remains constant. While superficially identical, as the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an <b>isotonic</b> contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes, but an isokinetic contraction will keep velocity constant while force changes.

50|$|Three {{types of}} nasal sprays {{preparations}} of sodium chloride are available including hypertonic (3% sodium chloride or sea water), <b>isotonic</b> (0.9% sodium chloride) and hypotonic (0.65% sodium chloride). <b>Isotonic</b> solutions {{have the same}} salt concentration as the human body, whereas hypertonic solutions have a higher salt content and hypotonic solutions have a lower salt content. <b>Isotonic</b> saline nasal sprays are commonly used in infants and children to wash out the thick mucus from the nose in case of allergic rhinitis.
