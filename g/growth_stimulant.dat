Seed treatment by stimulant Ekogel at concentrations of 20 ml/ 1 l of water and 30 ml/ 1 l of water result in increase of seed germination and seedlings safety. The extremely high concentration of Ekogel (40 ml/ 1 l of water) authentically decreases as seed germination (on 21 %), and the seedlings safety (on 20 %). Ekogel stimulant is the best for seed germination of Siberian spruce, thus having a significant positive effect at all studied concentrations. Extreme concentrations of Heteroauxin (4 g/ 1 l of water) also had a positive impact on the seed germination and seedling safety (20 and 15 % above the control respectively). Seed treatment of Siberian larch by a Novosil stimulant of high concentration (10 drops/ 1 l of water) and Obereg stimulant (7 drops / 500 ml water) has led to an increase in seed germination compared to controls at 26 and 25 % respectively.

40|$|M. Sc. There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} concern worldwide regarding the possible adverse effects of pharmaceutical supplements present in our aquatic ecosystems {{and whether or not}} they modify or alter physiological functioning in humans and wildlife. Trenbolone acetate (TBA) for example, is a commonly used androgenic anabolic steroid used in the production of cattle. TBA is metabolized into trenbolone-β and excreted as both trenbolone-α and -β. In liquid manure trenbolone-β has a half-life of over 270 days. Therefore if released into the surrounding environment there could be severe ecological impacts. The aim of this study was to determine the physiological effects of hormones used as <b>growth</b> <b>stimulants</b> in cattle production on the Sharptooth Catfish - Clarias gariepinus. The <b>growth</b> <b>stimulants</b> assessed in this study included; Trenbolone acetate, Methyltestosterone, Diethylstilbestrol and Zeranol. The aim was pursued with the use of three biomarker assays - Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Uridine-Diphosphate Glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) and Cellular Energy Allocation (CEA). Fish were exposed under controlled conditions for a period of 5, ten and 15 days respectively using a flow-through system. Testes were removed and standard histological techniques were employed. Selected target organs were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until needed for biomarker analysis. The results obtained from the gonado-somatic Index (GSI) showed that there were no significant differences (p< 0. 05). The hepato-somatic index (HSI) increased throughout all the different exposure groups. The histological assessment showed no significant alterations in the cell structure of the testes. With regards to the biomarkers used, CEA reflected changes in both the energy available and the energy consumed by the test organisms during the exposures. A common trend was observed throughout the different exposures. A change would occur after the ten day exposure period however a recovery would be made after 15 days of exposure. Both GST and UDPGT reflected increased activity in the liver with GST reflecting a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the control and the exposure groups, however GST activity in the kidneys were not affected. To conclude, further studies will be needed to determine whether or not these <b>growth</b> <b>stimulants</b> will have a significant effect at higher concentrations and over longer exposure periods...|$|R

40|$|To {{keep the}} concept of a safe food supply to the consumers, animal feed {{industries}} world over are showing an increasing interest in the direct-fed microbials (DFM) for improved animal performance in terms of growth or productivity. This becomes all the more essential in a situation, where a number of the residues of antibiotics and/or other <b>growth</b> <b>stimulants</b> reach in milk and meat with a number of associated potential risks for the consumers. Hence, in the absence of <b>growth</b> <b>stimulants,</b> a positive manipulation of the rumen microbial ecosystem to enhance the feedstuff utilization for improved production efficiency by ruminants has become of much interest to the researchers and entrepreneurs. A few genera of live microbes (i. e., bacteria, fungi and yeasts in different types of formulations from paste to powder) are infrequently used as DFM for the domestic ruminants. These DFM products are live microbial feed supplements containing naturally occurring microbes in the rumen. Among different DFM possibilities, anaerobic rumen fungi (ARF) based additives have been found to improve ruminant productivity consistently during feeding trials. Administration of ARF during the few trials conducted, led to the increased weight gain, milk production, and total tract digestibility of feed components in ruminants. Anaerobic fungi in the rumen display very strong cell-wall degrading cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities through rhizoid development, resulting in the physical disruption of feed structure paving the way for bacterial action. Significant improvements in the fiber digestibility were found to coincide with increases in ARF in the rumen indicating their role. Most of the researches based on DFM have indicated a positive response in nutrient digestion and methane reducing potential during in vivo and/or in vitro supplementation of ARF as DFM.
