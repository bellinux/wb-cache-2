50|$|The {{chest and}} <b>arm</b> <b>protector</b> or <b>arm</b> and body pad is {{designed}} to protect the chest, shoulders, arms, and collarbone area from the impact of pucks and is worn under the hockey jersey. The chest and <b>arm</b> <b>protector</b> has continually become more protective in recent years. In the early days of goaltending, it was much smaller and less protective, consisting mostly of thick felt. In effect, these pads were little better than what baseball catchers wear today. With the advent of better materials such as high density plastics and foams, chest protectors can be made to protect the body from injury. However, even with modern chest protectors, goaltenders still receive bruises and other minor injuries from pucks that hit them in the torso.|$|R
50|$|A {{detailed}} discussion of the sources is devoted by Dumézil to showing {{that they do not}} support the theory of an agrarian Mars. Mars would be invoked both in the Carmen Arvale and in Cato's prayer as the guardian, the <b>armed</b> <b>protector</b> of the fields and the harvest. He is definitely not a deity of agricultural plenty and fertility.|$|R

Protective area extends down to the abdomen and is usually tied onto the pants to provide seamless protection. These pads offer very little spine/back protection to save on weight and material, and to prevent heat buildup.|$|R
50|$|Using the falx, the Dacian warriors {{were able}} to counter {{the power of the}} compact, massed Roman formations. During the time of the Roman conquest of Dacia (101 - 102, 105 - 106), legionaries had {{reinforcing}} iron straps applied to their helmets. The Romans also introduced the use of leg and <b>arm</b> <b>protectors</b> (greaves and manica) as further protection against the falxes.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{increased}} dangers of improvised explosive devices, newer versions of the vital plates and components have been developed. The Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBIs) have become available, along with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS). These new systems are becoming the standard for forward deployed troops. The E-SAPI plates offer increased protection from 7.62mm armor-piercing ammunition. The ESBIs is an attachable MOLLE ballistic panel with a pouch for a 8x6 side-SAPI, for protection {{of the side of}} the torso/under the arm. DAPS consists of two ambidextrous modular components, the Deltoid (upper <b>arm)</b> <b>Protector</b> and the Axillary (under <b>arm)</b> <b>Protector,</b> and provide for additional protection from fragmentary and projectiles to the upper arm and underarm areas. With the Interceptor body armor, E-SAPI plates (10.9 pounds), ESBIs (7.75 pounds), DAPS (5.03 pounds) and with the neck, throat and groin protectors installed the armor is significantly heavier at 33.1 pounds (15 kg).|$|R

50|$|With {{time the}} unit type evolved into medium cavalry, almost {{identical}} to Polish pancerni. The armour used by those later units included a full chainmail armour with misiurka and <b>arm</b> <b>protectors</b> and often also a kalkan, a round Turkish-style shield. In the 17th century the chainmail was gradually replaced by cuirasses. The offensive armament in use by Petyhorcy included a 3 to 4-metres-long lance of bear spear (rohatyna), {{as well as a}} Polish sabre, two pistols and a musket carbine or an eastern-type bow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first version}} of the work was {{finished}} on 2 July 1915, but Janáček later revised it and made substantial changes. The second, almost complete, version was finished on 29 March 1918. Taras Bulba was premiered at the National Theatre in Brno on 9 October 1921, conducted by František Neumann. The composition was dedicated to [...] "our army, the <b>armed</b> <b>protector</b> of our nation". It was published by Hudební matice in 1924 in piano duet arrangement made by Břetislav Bakala. In 1927 the full score was published with further changes.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{formed by}} Caucasian mountaineers, the light cavalry units were with time also joined by Lithuanian Tartars and local landed gentry. Much like other steppe units, the petyhorcy units were {{initially}} armoured only in light misiurka (chainmail cap) and karwasz, {{a type of}} steel <b>arm</b> <b>protectors.</b> The offensive armament included a lance, possibly identical to the long lance used by Polish Winged Hussars. The first such units were formed {{during the reign of}} king Stefan Batory. A commander of one of such units, cerain Temruk Szymkowic, was recorded as a rotmistrz already during the reign of Sigismund August, but it is uncertain whether he commanded a circassian unit at that time.|$|R

50|$|Under the Carolingians it {{was made}} {{obligatory}} on bishops, abbots and abbesses to appoint such officials in every county where they held property. The office was not hereditary, the advocatus being chosen, either by the abbot alone, or by the abbot and bishop concurrently with the count. The same causes {{that led to the}} development of the feudal system also affected the advocatus. In times of confusion churches and abbeys needed not so much a legal representative as an <b>armed</b> <b>protector,</b> while as feudal immunities were conceded to the ecclesiastical foundations, these required a representative to defend their rights and to fulfill their secular obligations to the state, such as leading the ecclesiastical levies to war. A new class of advocatus thus arose, whose office, commonly rewarded by a grant of land, crystallized into a fief, which, like other fiefs, had by the beginning of the 11th century become hereditary.|$|R
50|$|The {{picture of}} Theodoric's rule is drawn {{for us in}} the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman {{minister}} Cassiodorus. The Goths seem to have been thick on the ground in northern Italy; in the south they formed little more than garrisons. In Theodoric's theory the Goth was the <b>armed</b> <b>protector</b> of the peaceful Roman; the Gothic king had the toil of government, while the Roman consul had the honour. All the forms of the Roman administration went on, and the Roman policy and culture had great influence on the Goths themselves. The rule of the prince over distinct nations in the same land was necessarily despotic; the old Germanic freedom was necessarily lost. Such a system needed a Theodoric to carry it on. It broke in pieces after his death. Meanwhile, the Frankish king Clovis fought protracted wars against various enemies while consolidating his rule, forming the embryonic stages of what would eventually become Medieval Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] (ともえ), or [...] (tomowe) in its archaic form, is a Japanese symbol {{described}} as a swirl that resembles a comma or the usual form of a magatama. The origin of tomoe is uncertain. Some think that it originally meant tomoe (...) , or drawings on tomo (...) , a round <b>arm</b> <b>protector</b> used by an archer, whereas others see tomoe as stylized magatama. It is a common design element in Japanese family emblems (kamon) and corporate logos, particularly in triplicate whorls known as mitsudomoe (三つ巴). Some view the mitsudomoe as representative of the threefold division (Man, Earth, and Sky) {{at the heart of}} the Shinto religion. It was also associated with the Shinto war deity Hachiman, and through that was adopted by the samurai as their traditional symbol. One mitsudomoe variant, the Hidari Gomon, is the traditional symbol of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. The Koyasan Shingon sect of Buddhism uses the Hidari Gomon as a visual representation of the cycle of life.|$|R
50|$|The time of {{the conquest}} of Dacia by Trajan is the only known {{instance}} of the Roman army adapting personal equipment while on campaign, and {{it seems likely that}} this was a response to this deadly weapon. Roman legionaries had transverse reinforcing iron straps applied to their helmets - it is clear that these are late modifications because they are roughly applied across existing embossed decoration. The legions also reintroduced the wearing of lorica hamata and lorica squamata for the Dacia campaign as both were more flexible than the newer segmentata armour and were able to distribute damage more widely. In addition, both these older armour styles had unique modifications, a row of pteruges was added to the sleeves, a double row of pteruges was added to the skirt and a heavily padded vestment was worn underneath them. Roman armour of the time left limbs unprotected; Trajan introduced the use of greaves and an <b>arm</b> <b>protector</b> (manica) for the right arm, which had previously been used only by gladiators, and which was never used again by soldiers once the Dacia campaign concluded.|$|R
50|$|Various media outlets, {{including}} the Ministry of Defence itself, have generated some confusion {{as to the}} name of Osprey body armour, often incorrectly labelling it as 'Kestrel' in both photo captions and in article text. This {{was due to the}} introduction of limited sets of both types of body armour around the same time in late 2005 and early 2006. Kestrel is a single piece body armour unit, looking like a modified bomb-disposal suit and containing the same small plates as the CBA it replaced. It was issued to troops on 'top-cover' as an Urgent Operational Requirement to provide better protection against the effects of IED detonations, but the design and rigidity of the suit left the wearer almost unable to operate his weapon system. With the issue of collar and <b>arm</b> <b>protectors,</b> often known as 'wings' by troops, with every set of Osprey, Kestrel became redundant and was withdrawn from service in late 2006. With Osprey collars and 'wings' fitted the wearer is still capable of operating weapon systems effectively.|$|R

60|$|This was done, {{with the}} effect John had anticipated. Hearing {{the sound of}} horns, all over the mountainside, the Romans {{concluded}} that a great force was advancing to attack them; and the archers were at once recalled. The troops all stood to arms and, for several hours, remained waiting an attack. Then, after strong bodies of heavy-armed troops--preceded by the archers, skirmishing before them--had pushed some distance into the forest without meeting with an enemy, the work recommenced; a considerable number still standing to their <b>arms,</b> as <b>protectors</b> to the rest.|$|R
60|$|Weathering out the gale {{which had}} driven them from Leith, Paul's ships {{for a few}} days were {{employed}} in giving chase to various merchantmen and colliers; capturing some, sinking others, and putting the rest to flight. Off the mouth of the Humber they ineffectually manoeuvred with a view of drawing out a king's frigate, reported to be lying at anchor within. At another time a large fleet was encountered, under convoy of some ships of force. But their panic caused the fleet to hug the edge of perilous shoals very nigh the land, where, by reason of his having no competent pilot, Paul durst not approach to molest them. The same night he saw two strangers further out at sea, and chased them until three in the morning, when, getting pretty nigh, ho surmised that they must needs be vessels of his own squadron, which, previous to his entering the Firth of Forth, had separated from his command. Daylight proved this supposition correct. Five vessels of the original squadron were now once more in company. About noon a fleet of forty merchantmen appeared coming round Flamborough Head, protected by two English man-of-war, the Serapis and Countess of Scarborough. Descrying the five cruisers sailing down, the forty sail, like forty chickens, fluttered in a panic under the wing of the shore. Their <b>armed</b> <b>protectors</b> bravely steered from the land, making the disposition for battle. Promptly accepting the challenge, Paul, giving the signal to his consorts, earnestly pressed forward. But, earnest as he was, it was seven in the evening ere the encounter began. Meantime his comrades, heedless of his signals, sailed independently along. Dismissing them from present consideration, we confine ourselves, for a while, to the Richard and the Serapis, the grand duellists of the fight.|$|R

Graham rushed forwards; he and the gentleman, a powerful man though grey-haired, united their strength to thrust back the throng; her head and long hair fell back over his shoulder: she seemed unconscious.|$|R
