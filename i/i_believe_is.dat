500|$|Wright {{intended}} for the film to be [...] "as subjective as possible" [...] in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does. This focus on Elizabeth features some dramatic changes from the novel. Knightley's Elizabeth has an [...] "increasingly aloof and emotionally distant" [...] relationship with her family. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events. Wright wanted to create a [...] "real" [...] relationship between the two sisters and have them grow apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too [...] "syrupy." [...] Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to [...] "keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden to her... As she keeps all this to herself, we feel for her more and more.

Dailly was also responsible for the [...] "custom" [...] levels based on other Psygnosis and Reflections Interactive Amiga games, such as Shadow of the Beast, Menace, Awesome and Shadow of the Beast II. These [...] "crossover" [...] levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, [...] "This <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve." [...] Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.|$|E

2500|$|While Wittgenstein {{was living}} in {{isolation}} in rural Austria, the Tractatus was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, part of Wilhelm Ostwald's journal Annalen der Naturphilosophie, though Wittgenstein was {{not happy with the}} result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy. In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote [...] "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by props—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by pros, but only shown (gezeigt); which, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> the cardinal problem of philosophy." [...] But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the Tractatus.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity {{derivatives}} sales {{business in}} Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an op-ed in The New York Times. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing {{touch with the}} company's culture, which he described as [...] "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years." [...] Smith said that advising clients [...] "to do what <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> right for them" [...] was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a [...] "toxic and destructive" [...] environment in which [...] "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as [...] "" [...] and colleagues callously talked about [...] "ripping their clients off". In reply, Goldman Sachs said that [...] "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming [...] "this fundamental truth {{lies at the heart}} of how we conduct ourselves" [...] and that [...] "we don't think [...] reflect the way we run our business." [...] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.|$|E

And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it.

2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> happening in Ulster. But all I {{would like to say}} is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E
