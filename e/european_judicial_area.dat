40|$|RESUMÉ The {{topic of}} this work is "Selected {{questions}} of the European civil procedural law. " The <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>area</b> {{is regarded as the}} most progressive area of private law in the European Union. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam unification of regulation in this area has undergone remarkable development. The Council Regulation (EC) No. 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (regulation Brussels I) is the center {{of this work}}. The regulation Brussels I is the successor of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels Convention). Brussels Convention was the first general multilateral instrument on the recognition of judgements which directly regulated the jurisdiction of the Contracting states. The first part of this work concerns the object of the european civil procedural law, the origin of the Brussels Convention {{and the role of the}} Court of Justice of the European Communities. In the whole work is emphasis the importance of relevant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, particularly in the part about juridiction.

While every day new difficulties arise in the process of harmonisation of substantive criminal law in the Union (for example, the endless debates on fixing penalties), applying the principie of mutual recognition to the European arrest warrant has made it possible (undoubtedly under considerable political pressure) to achieve genuine progress in realising the área of freedom, security and justice. The European arrest warrant must replace the mechanisms for extradition between the Member States that are currently in forcé. The scope of the European arrest warrant covers all the situations that were previously provided for under the 1957 European Convention on Extradition. The Framework Decisión will replace the complex legal corpus consisting until now of the European Convention on Extradition and its two protocols, Chapter IV of Title III of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement, and the two European Union Conventions on Extradition of 1995 and 1996. In this respect it will be a valuable and, hopefully, effective tool for the experts. With a view tó the subsequent work of implementing and evaluating the Framework Decisión, this note aims to give an initial overview of the key provisions of the text, compare the text adopted with the Commission's initial proposals and, above all, highlight the questions which remain to be addressed and on which there will have to be more work as the process advances...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the conceptual problems and practical issues that arise if a party commences proceedings under the Brussels I Regulation in another Member State in breach {{of an agreement}} that provides for arbitration in England. The {{focus is on the}} jurisdiction and powers of the English court when enforcing an arbitration agreement and the limits imposed by the Regulation's regime and underpinning principles regarding the relationship between Member State courts. Thus, the conflict between the English court and the foreign court is on the allocation of competence to decide upon the arbitration agreement's existence, validity and scope and on the jurisdiction of the court seised under the Regulation. The thesis examines this problem against the background of the legal framework that encompasses the international, national and EU level. In addition to this, this thesis is concerned with the role and competence of the arbitral tribunal for the decision on the arbitration agreement. Although the Regulation excludes 'arbitration' from its scope, the issue of the compatibility of the English courts' powers concerning foreign proceedings in breach of an arbitration agreement with the Regulation has recently seen significant development within the <b>European</b> <b>Judicial</b> <b>Area.</b> In particular the decision of the European Court of Justice in West Tankers that found the anti-suit injunction at variance with the Regulation has marked a turning point. This thesis undertakes a critical assessment of the court's reasoning in West Tankers and the repercussions for litigation and arbitration in England in its aftermath, in particular with regard to procedural and substantive alternatives to the anti-suit injunction. In its final part, the thesis addresses the envisaged reform of the Brussels I Regulation with regard to its interface with proceedings where the arbitration agreement is at issue. A critical assessment of the conflicting reform proposals against the background of the competing objectives of the Regulation's regime and international commercial arbitration is undertaken and an argument is made that the divergences in the choice of law rules on the arbitration agreement should be brought back into the spotlight and considered for a comprehensive solution.

This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the distinguished Professor Dr. Mihajlo Dika, one of the greatest scholars in the field of Civil Procedure Law and a renowned intellectual and humanist. And perhaps more importantly, Professor Dika is an unforgettable teacher and mentor and one of my dearest colleagues. The development of the European Private International Law (PIL) system in the post-Amsterdam (1999) stage of European law shows that its provisions have gradually come under the competence of the EU and have deeply influenced autonomous national law. Croatia entered the EU on 1 July 2013, at which moment the process of communitarization of PIL in the member states (MS) was nearly completed. The process of Croatia 2 ̆ 7 s accession to the EU, which started in 2001, practically coincided with the communitarization of PIL rules in the EU. In civil matters with cross-border implications, faced with a jungle of national and EU PIL rules and competences, every judge and arbitrator in Croatia should apply provisions of PIL, including international civil procedure rules. In order to fulfil his duty he must obey the following hierarchy of norms. According to the general clause in Article 216 TFEU, the EU is empowered to conclude international agreements with one or more third countries. Therefore, in principle, the EU member states lose the authority to enter into international agreements. In these cases, the exclusive external competence of the EU applies (Article 3 (2) TFEU), which only confirms the earlier ECJ Opinion 1 / 03 of 7 February 2006 concerning the conclusion by the EC of the 2007 Lugano Convention to be applied in the European Economic Area. For the purposes of internal market and the constitution of the <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>area</b> (Article 67 (1) TFEU), which requires common rules of judicial cooperation in civil matters (Article 81 TFEU), the EU has adopted a number of key EU regulations on international jurisdiction, the choice of law (Article 81 (2) (c) TFEU), and mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (Article 81 (2) (a) TFEU). These regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in Croatia. They prevail over national sources and, as a rule, supersede conventions concluded between member states. That makes national PIL rules, special statutes and PIL Acts or customary law applicable only to legal issues not falling within the (material) scope of EU regulations. Since 1988 a considerable number of directives have been adopted, containing conflict rules with EU-related application. They are binding as well, but they become applicable only by enactment through national legislation, thus producing a direct effect on parties involved in PIL matters. Finally, the national and EU PIL provisions must comply with the general principles of EU law (Articles 18, 20 to 21 TFEU), with free movement (Articles 34 to 36, Article 36, Article 45, Article 49, Article 54, Articles 56 and 63 TFEU); and respect for basic human rights (Article 6, Articles 8 and 13) of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights) and (Articles 24 and 47) the 2000 EU Charter of Fundamental Rights...|$|E

40|$|U radu se analizira koncept priznanja i postupak priznanja sudskih odluka po Uredbi Bruxelles I. Nakon uvodnog dijela, u drugom dijelu rada obrazlaže se koncepti priznanja po Uredbi Bruxelles I i to prvo opća pitanja vezana uz {{institut}} priznanja, a zatim pravni učinci strane odluke koji se priznanjem protežu u državu priznanja. U trećem, središnjem dijelu rada razmatraju se dva načina priznanja koja Uredba Bruxelles I predviđa: automatsko priznanje, priznanje u posebnom postupku u kojem je utvrđenje da je strana odluka podobna za priznanje glavni predmet tog postupka, te odlučivanje o priznanju kao o prethodnom pitanju unutar jednog postupka. U okviru tog dijela rada obrazlaže se i institut djelomičnog priznanja. Predmet četvrtog dijela rada jest institut prekida postupka priznanja. The subject-matter of {{the paper}} is the concept of “recognition“ of foreign judgments and the procedure for the recognition of foreign judgments under Regulation (EC) No. 44 / 2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation), the most important legal source of procedural private international law of the European Union. After the introductory part, the second part {{of the paper}} comments on the concept of “recognition“ under the Brussels I Regulation, firstly on general issues with regard to recognition: legal theories on recognition, irrelevance of recognition in a third country, the requirement that legal effects of a judgment must have arisen in the state of origin, the scope of recognition, the text (wording) in which the judgment is recognized, the moment in time when recognition is decided upon and the period of the time of the recognition. Thereafter, the limits of authority enjoyed by a judgment in the State of recognition pursuant to a principle of extension of a judgment’s effects from a State of origin into a State of recognition are analysed: effect of finality of a judgment as to its substance (materiellrechtliche Rechtskräftigkeit), estoppel effect (Präklusionswirkung), constitutive effect (Gestalltungswirkung), procedural effect towards third persons, foreign judgment as a legally relevant fact, burden of proof and enforceability. In the third part of the paper, which represents the most essential part, three forms of recognition foreseen by the Brussels I Regulation, are analysed: automatic recognition, recognition in a declaratory proceedings, and recognition as an incidental issue within the framework of other proceedings. The principle of automatic recognition, as accepted by the Regulation, provides that judgments issued in one Member State are automatically recognized in other Member States without any prior proceedings or formal steps. It represents one of the pillars on which the <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>area</b> is based and directly contributes to “rapid and simple recognition and enforcement“ accepted as a main goal of the Regulation pursuant to Recital 2 of its Preamble. With regard to the recognition procedure in which the main issue is the determination as to whether a foreign decision is capable of being recognised, the notions “interested party” and “dispute” are considered as well as the possibility of only initiating the procedure for a positive and not a negative declaration and. It is emphasised that the special procedure for recognition can be initiated independently as well as together with a request for the declaration of enforceability of the foreign judgment. Further, the effect of annulment or amendment of the decision in the State of origin on the recognition procedure and the legal nature of the decision on the declaration of recognition is discussed. Regarding recognition as an incidental issue, the difference in terminology of several languages of the Regulation is emphasised, the scope of application of the respective provision is analysed, the court’s authority for refusal of recognition is considered and the mutatis mutandis application of rules of Sections 2 and 3 of the Chapter III of the Regulation. Within this part of the paper, the partial recognition of a foreign judgment is also explained. The fourth part of the paper considers stay of proceedings, especially the reasons for a stay and it is determined that a stay only relates to the prejudicial recognition procedure. In addition, the notion of the “regular legal remedy“ is explained, the discretionary power of the court to stay the proceedings is analysed and a special rule for Ireland and the United Kingdom is explained...|$|E
40|$|The book is {{dedicated}} to the study of trans-boundary and European insolvency procedures and represents a relevant and useful instrument in the analysis of the international, European and national policies with reference to judicial cooperation in the field of the insolvency procedures. In particular, the work faces in deepened and exhaustive way the topic of the insolvency of debtors whose entrepreneurial activities is localised in more than one legal order, supplying a critical reconstruction of the European discipline setting up autonomous rules concerning jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency decisions. In order to bring on a systematic study of the problem, the volume is subdivided in three sections, respectively devoted to the analysis of i) the national and international models that can represent a reference in order to prepare an independent discipline dedicated to the trans-boundary insolvency, ii) the Regulation 1346 / 2000 and iii) national rules of the Italian legal order. In {{the first part of the}} book – Chapter I - the Author takes care of the techniques that have been employed in order to rule the insolvency of an enterprise having cross-border characters, verifying that, on the one hand, the traditional models of the “universality” and “territoriality” are not employed in “pure” forms in any legal order and that, on the other hand, there are many obstacles to the full realization of the universal vocation inborn in every insolvency discipline (that is aimed to guarantee the par condicio creditorum principle). Then, the Author analyses the positive and negative aspects of the so called “limited universality”, that represents the outline which currently inspires the most recent rulings both at the international and national level. Such a theory allows a connection between the different jurisdictions of the interested States with the insolvency, without imposing the opening of a sole procedure with universal effects, but concurring the slope of parallel proceedings by coordinating their effects. The universality in the limited form presupposes that the procedure opened in the country in which the centre of the main interests of the debtor is localised has main character and can have universal character, but this does not forbid the opening of local proceedings in the States in which another seat of the enterprise in crisis is found. Chapter II {{is dedicated}} to the study of national rules inspired by the limited universality principle, as well as to the analysis of the instruments created in order to favour the acceptance of such a model by national legislators (i. e. the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and the Concordat of the International Bar Association). Among them, common law legal orders are taken in consideration (UK and USA), as well as civil law legislations (Switzerland, Germany and France). The Second Part of the monograph is devoted to the European common discipline of the insolvency and, in particular, to the analysis of Regulations 1346 / 2000 on insolvency procedures. Chapter III examines the evolution of the <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>area</b> that has brought to the adoption of the Regulation, emphasizing the reasons of the European Community intervention in this field. The following Chapters IV and V are dedicated to the deep analysis of the Regulation itself. To such purpose, detailed attention is given to the notion of “centre of the main interests” of the debtor and “establishment”, definitions relevant in order to operate the bipartition, made by the Regulation, between main and territorial-secondary insolvency procedures. Concerning recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered within the insolvency proceeding, the principle of mutual confidence that print the relationships between the Member States of the European Community is recalled. Such a principle has carried to the affirmation of the automatic recognition of decisions coming from European judges in civil and commercial matters, comprised those concerning bankruptcy. In the event in which decisions are wanted to produce their executive effects, it is said that the judge of the demanded State must always proceed to a preventive verification on the content and on the way of formation of the decision emitted in another EU State, exam that has to be brought on following the exequatur procedure verification set forth by Regulations 44 / 2001. The Third Part of the book, finally, {{is dedicated to}} the discipline of the insolvency in the Italian legal order, taking into account both rules contained in the bankrupt law and those introduced by private international law act (law 218 / 95). in this seat it is stressed the difficult coordination to which the interpreter is called upon when he has to face a cross-border insolvency case: in fact, while within the scope of application of Regulation 1346 / 2000 the main insolvency proceeding potentially has universal character, hypotheses that are not included in that scope of application remain subject to the rigid territorialistic principle that inspires the bankruptcy law of 1942 (that has not been modified yet). Chapter VI, therefore, proposes a new reading that, in an interpretative way, reconciles the conflicts gushing from the differences inspiring the different rules concerning jurisdiction and insolvency procedures with reference to the Italian legal order...|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} functioning of <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> networks as one modality of transnational dialogues between judges. In order to provide a conceptual framework, we first explore {{the meaning of the}} concepts of 'network', 'dialogue' and 'constitutional pluralism' and find that existing channels of communication between national courts and the CJEU hardly qualify as real dialogues. Then follows an in-depth examination of the practical workings of a number of well-established and active <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> networks, which bring together judges who are more or less at the same level in their domestic judicial hierarchy and have similar functions in their respective legal systems. This involves determining who participates in judicial networks; how and to what end dialogues are conducted within these forums; and why judges may be motivated to participate in such networks. Using these insights, we argue that networks require a change in legal thinking, which is facilitated in the EU context by the constitutionalism pluralism discourse. Further, judicial networks have the potential to increase the dialogic qualities {{of the relationship between the}} CJEU and national courts, while they may at the same time affect the balance within that relationship in favour of the national courts...|$|R
