50|$|<b>Fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{manifolds}} {{are typically}} {{located in the}} inlet air duct just downstream of the final air filters but other locations can be desirable depending {{on the design of}} the inlet duct and the intended use of the fog system.|$|E
5000|$|Cold water <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{technologies}} {{were developed}} by industry in the late 1960s for factory air particulate control and agricultural orchard freeze prevention. These high pressure systems force filtered water at [...] through custom nozzles to atomize the water into billions of ultra-fine droplets below 10 um in in size. In industrial applications this also provides cooling due to rapid evaporation.|$|E
50|$|On 12 January 1673, after a fire {{broke out}} at the Admiraliteitslijnbaan, it was put out using fire hoses with <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{designed}} by Jan van der Heyden, the first time such <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> were used.|$|R
50|$|All {{styles of}} <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> have a spray pattern adjustment. These nozzles can produce three {{different}} types of streams; the straight stream for long reach, the narrow-angle cone for advancing an attack line into a structure or fire room, and the wide-angle cone for protection and ventilation.|$|R
50|$|The Miami Fire-Rescue Department, also {{referred}} to as the City of Miami Department of Fire-Rescue, provides fire protection and emergency medical services for the city of Miami, Florida. The department is notable for being the first in the nation to equip all apparatus with two-way radios as well as being the first to use <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of {{a cutting}} {{extinguisher}} is a fire extinguishing technique that combines abrasive waterjet cutting with water spray extinguishing, through a single handpiece or nozzle. The fire-fighter approaches the fire from outside the main fire area, then uses the cutting action to drill a small hole through a door or wall. Switching to a water spray then allows the fire to be fought, as with a conventional <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fog nozzles play an {{important}} part in firefighting tactics due to their versatility. The wide variety of <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> manufacturers allows them to accommodate different sizes of fire hose- most often attack hand line- and streams and are capable in both fire protection and attack. With regard to flow rate, it is imperative to be sure that each <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> be able to handle the flow rate of its water supply because the master stream devices to which they are sometimes attached can expel up to 2000 gal per minute. Nevertheless, as with almost all fog nozzles, those on master stream devices come with either automatic or manual spray pattern and stream adjustments. However, one significant disadvantage of fog nozzles is that Compressed Air Foam (CAF) bubbles' ratio of surface area to volume (which are formed by mixing air into a solution of water and foaming agents at the pump) exceeds that of fog nozzles' water droplets; therefore, the mechanical deflection in the nozzles themselves causes a loss of bubble structure, thereby reducing the CAF's ability to absorb heat. Despite this drawback, provided an appropriate nozzle pressure and water supply, fog nozzles are effective for any ground fire situation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a {{firefighting}} hose {{spray nozzle}} that breaks its stream into small droplets. By doing so, its stream achieves a greater surface area, {{and thus a}} greater rate of heat absorption, which, when {{compared to that of}} a smoothbore nozzle, speeds its transformation into the steam that smothers the fire by displacing its oxygen. Specially designed fog nozzles (with no stream adjustment) have been certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for use on Class B & C hazards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Spray {{droplet size}} {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as an important variable that applicators of vector control sprays {{must be aware of}} to make the most effective spray applications. Researchers and applicators have several different techniques available to assess spray droplet size from spray nozzles. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the droplet size spectrum produced by three nozzles commonly used in vector control in a high-speed wind tunnel, when characterized using three different laser-based droplet size measurement systems. Three droplet sizing systems: Malvern Spraytec laser diffraction, Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction, and TSI Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA), were simultaneously operated, but under different operating conditions, to measure the spray droplet size-spectra for three spray nozzles. The three atomizers: a TeeJet ® 8001 E even flat fan nozzle, a BETE ® PJ high pressure <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and a Micro-nair ® AU 5000 rotary atomizer were evaluated in a high speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 53 and 62 m/s (120 and 140 mph). Based on the results of this work, only the BETE ® PJ high pressure <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> met the label requirements for both Fyfanon ® and Anvil®. While the other nozzle might met the Dv 0. 5 (VMD – volume median diameter) requirement for Fyfanon®, the resulting Dv 0. 9 values exceeded labeled size restrictions. When applying Anvil with the BETE PJ high pressure <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> it is important to use the smaller two ori...|$|R

Set for completion in 2012, the sculpture will be a 30 by 30 ft grid of stainless steel poles outfitted with <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Kahn said of the sculpture, [...] "When the fog is on, it will appear like a 20-foot-diameter sphere 20 ft of fog spinning inside the poles." ...|$|R
50|$|Demineralized {{water is}} {{typically}} pressurized to 2000 psi (138 bar) then {{injected into the}} inlet air duct through an array of stainless steel <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Demineralized water is used {{in order to prevent}} fouling of the compressor blades that would occur if water with mineral content were evaporated in the airflow. Fog systems typically produce a water spray, with about 90% of the water flow being in droplets that are 20 microns in diameter or smaller.|$|R
40|$|The cabin {{concept is}} widely used for fire {{protection}} in the retail areas of many big public transport terminals in the Far East However, very little systematic experimental studies were reported to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} system. Preliminary experimental studies on performance of full "cabins," with operation of the installed mechanical smoke exhaust and sprinkler system, were carried out. A cabin of length 3. 5 m, width 4 m, and height 3 m was constructed with supply air flow rate adjusted by the door size. A smoke exhaust system and sprinkler system were installed. Small fires with lower heat release rates up to 1. 3 MW was set up with wood crib. Both normal sprinkler nozzle and water <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> were studied. Seven of the tests carried out will be reported in this article. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Department of Agricultural Engineering. Faculty of Agriculture and {{veterinary}} King Saud University, Buraidah. Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaUnder arid climate condition, greenhouses consume {{considerable amount}} of water for cooling purposes. This research was conducted to test three cooling systems: cooling pad system, drip cooling system. and fogging nozzle system. The results indicated that acceptable level of cooling was possible by all systems (5 to 12 °C reduction in outside condition). Fogging system performed the best. Water consumption reached 16 to 20 (I/day per square meter of greenhouse's floor area) for cooling pad system. Reduc-tion of 61 % in water consumption was possible by using <b>Fogging</b> <b>nozzle</b> system instead of cooling pad sys-tem. Drip cooling system achieved 28 % reduction in water use compared to cooling pad system...|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{is constructed}} of three column forms fabricated from stainless steel and bronze, that reference {{the shape of}} buoys, each column contains multiple <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> LED light sources, motion sensors, and sound systems. The sculptural columns are surrounded by a boat-shaped outline of granite seawall blocks, salvaged from landfill containing 18th century piers that were discovered during sub-surface highway construction. The 2000 lb granite seawall blocks are elevated on stainless steel supports that allow the fog to travel under the blocks, and openings between the elevated blocks allow passage into the interior space. Multiple motion sensors {{on top of the}} vertical columns register pedestrian activity that is transmitted to a computer processor to control changing sequences of fog, light, and sound.|$|R
50|$|Pegasus and Dragon is a 100 ft tall {{statue of}} Pegasus {{defeating}} a dragon in Gulfstream Park, Hallandale Beach, Florida. It is the 3rd tallest statue in the United States after Birth of the New World and the Statue of Liberty and the 2nd tallest excluding US territories. They {{are also the}} world's largest and tallest equine and european dragon statues. The dragon stands 50 feet high. The statue complex is 200 feet in length and 115 feet in width. Pegasus is made of 330 tons of steel and 132 tons of bronze. The dragon is made of 110 tons of steel and 132 tons of bronze. Pegasus will feature a 5D dome theater in a rock formation underneath it. The dragon is surrounded by musical fountains. At night the statue will be home to a fountain show featuring 13 musical pieces, 350 <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> 116 water nozzles, special LED lighting and dragon breathing fire 20 feet during the show.|$|R
50|$|Built for the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1963, the International Fountain's {{original}} design had changing water and light patterns, {{with a background}} of classical music (though the patterns weren't specifically intended to be synched with the music.) The fountain was very large, designed as a concrete bowl around a 'moonscape' of broken limestone, {{at the center of}} which was a tiled dome studded with pointy black nozzles. The fountain was not originally designed for interaction but was redesigned in 1996 by WET to make the fountain more inviting, interactive and safe. Switching out the multicolored lights for white, WET added <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> a ring of their Shooters set into the pavers {{around the base of the}} dome, and four large SuperShooters hidden in the upper surface of the dome. The restored fountains behaves as its predecessor did for most of the day, producing changing water patterns as music plays, but it now marks each hour by bringing out other effects, like fog, and performs a choreographed show.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> come in many in {{different}} styles and sizes, {{but there are}} three types which encompass most: automatic, selectable, and manually adjustable. All contain an adjustable baffle that, like a thumb placed {{on the end of}} a garden hose, keeps their flow rates and stream reaches steady and finely adjustable despite variations in water pressure at the nozzle. To adjust the flow, the first two types use a control handle, or 'bale' located at the top of nozzle; however, selectable nozzles have a fixed set of flow rates (e.g., 60, 95, and 125 GPM (gallons per min)) that are chosen with a ring or [...] located at their tips. It is important to note that selectable nozzles will only flow if the pump pressure exceeds the nozzle pressure. Moreover, the selectable nozzle will change its nozzle pressure and reach as the handle is moved, but the automatic nozzle will automatically re-adjust its opening as the firefighter adjusts its flow rate in order to maintain the correct pressure.|$|R
