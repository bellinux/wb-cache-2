5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{calls in the}} early 21st century for the Nobel Foundation to rescind the prize it awarded to Moniz for {{developing}} lobotomy, a decision that has been called an astounding <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> {{at the time and}} one that psychiatry might still need to learn from, but the Foundation declined to take action and has continued to host an article defending the results of the procedure.|$|E
25|$|All {{passengers}} and medical staff were saved, {{but there was}} one fatality among the crew, a stoker was accidentally left on the ship and he drowned when he tried to swim to shore. At the subsequent inquiry, Captain McNeil testified that he had fully trusted that the pilot knew where the buoys were, particularly because the pilots were in charge of moving the buoys to protect the harbour during wartime. The pilot was found guilty of a gross <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> and demoted.|$|E

Ultimately, it concluded that France had been the foreign power most involved in limiting the scale of the genocide once it got started, though it regretted that more had not been done.|$|R

25|$|Egyptienne {{was present}} at the Battle of Cape Finisterre, but did not {{participate}} in the engagement. While reconnoitering in advance of the fleet she captured a Danish merchant brig. After the battle she took the disabled Spanish 74-gun Firme in tow. After the battle, Admiral Robert Calder requested a court-martial to review his decision not to pursue the enemy fleet after the engagement. Fleming was one of the witnesses. The court martial ruled that Calder's failure to pursue was an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> not a manifestation of cowardice, and severely reprimanded him.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one year}} after the accident, on 15 July 2011, the Security Council of Aeronáutica Civil {{concluded}} that the cause of the accident was the execution of the final approach below the glide path, due to an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> by the crew who believed they were much higher. This is typical of a “black hole” illusion, which is experienced during a night approach to a low contrast runway environment surrounded by bright lights, aggravated by heavy rain. Aeronaútica Civil recommended retraining of the crew. Although the accident was caused by human error, Aeronaútica representative Colonel Carlos Silva reminded {{that the purpose of the}} investigation was not to apportion blame but to prevent aircraft accidents that may occur in the future.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E

25|$|Later in 2002, Mark Waugh {{was dropped}} from the Test team, and Lehmann was {{recalled}} {{for the first time}} in almost four years. After playing three Tests without posting a large score, Lehmann was injured, and Martin Love replaced him. Lehmann came under more pressure upon his return, when during an ODI against Sri Lanka, he had an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> and was run out. Upon returning to the dressing room, he made an offensive racial comment which saw him banned for five ODI matches, becoming the first player banned for racial vilification. After missing the first part of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lehmann went on to take the winning catch in the final against India in Johannesburg. Lehmann's Test spot was spared when Martyn was forced out due to a finger injury, with Love and Lehmann playing in the middle order on the subsequent tour of the West Indies. Lehmann then posted his maiden Test century on the tour, and on the winter Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries to solidify his position in the team. His Test career was again put on hold, when he was injured in November against Zimbabwe, allowing Katich to play in his place and score a century and top score in both innings in the Fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground to stake a claim for Lehmann's spot. However, Steve Waugh retired after the series, and both players were included on the tour to Sri Lanka. There, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries on turning tracks against Muttiah Muralitharan to help Australia to a 3–0 clean sweep despite conceding a first innings lead in each of the matches.|$|E

500|$|Byrne was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: [...] "Oh, look, just put in 10%." [...] A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back initialled (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, [...] "10% is better than nothing". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such {{large sums of money}} they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: [...] "They couldn't wait to get somebody else to do this, because they were in a mess themselves." [...] Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, every English county cricket {{team had}} an amateur captain. Yorkshire had been led by amateurs since Lord Hawke {{took over the}} {{position}} in 1883. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the working classes. Class distinctions pervaded the game, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles {{for members of the}} Establishment, in defiance of broader social changes that had reduced their influence in other sports. Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over [...] employment. The Wisden editor believed that [...] "the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> would prejudice his standing with the committee, he might well hesitate to take risks." [...] In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, [...] "Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England." [...] His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised. This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927.|$|E

The Court said, [...] "Padilla's sentence of 12 years below {{the low end of}} the [...] guidelines range reflects a clear <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> about the sentencing of this career offender."

The storm sank three destroyers and inflicted heavy damage on many other ships. Some 800men were lost, in addition to 146aircraft.

[...] Extremely militaristic songs that glorify triumph over the enemy are not the standard in the Israeli repertoire. [...] Rather, most songs dealing with war are melancholy in tone. [...] An extreme example is the song [...] "Eliphelet": to a halting melody in a minor key by Sasha Argov, the song (lyrics by Natan Alterman) tells of a boy [...] "without a penny's worth of character", who is killed in combat for an unthinking <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment.</b>|$|E

He used Admiral Hipper, at that moment also loose in the Atlantic, to create a diversion by ordering her to the south. In retrospect it was an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment.</b> Lütjens' orders were to avoid combat on equal terms. He had not realised—and was not to know—that southern convoys were virtually undefended {{at this point in}} the war, but on orders of the British Admiralty, all northern convoys had an escort of at least one Capital Ship.

2500|$|The five-member Philippines Board of Marine Inquiry, in its 65-page report dated August 25, 2008, {{submitted}} to the Maritime Industry Authority or Marina, found Sulpicio Lines and its captain liable for the tragedy. The BMI recommended that Marina [...] "consider the suspension of the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) of Sulpicio Lines in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations (and its criminal liability for the sinking)." [...] The final report blamed human error, and ruled that the ship's missing and presumed dead captain, Florencio Marimon, [...] "miscalculated" [...] the risk of continuing the trip to Cebu despite the stormy weather. According to the report: [...] "The immediate cause of the capsizing of MV Princess of the Stars was {{the failure of the}} Master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> that brought MV Princess of the Stars in harm's way into the eye of Typhoon Frank ...
