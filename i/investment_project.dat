This approach consists of the unification of real option valuation and game theory principles.

Analysis of this example compares the <b>investment</b> <b>project's</b> value in case when the R&D investment is not carried out with the case when this investment is made.

Within the framework of the given illustrative example a breakdown of the <b>investment</b> <b>project's</b> value is demonstrated in different cases...|$|R
