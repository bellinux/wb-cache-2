While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's <b>fixations,</b> his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E

25|$|Irwin's {{conclusion}} regarding transsaccadic {{memory is}} that there are no separate mechanisms, but that rather it is the same as short-term visual memory. Irwin's experiments showed that people cannot fuse pre-saccadic and post-saccadic images in successive <b>fixations.</b> These results are evidence against spatiotopic fusion. According to Irwin, there is no transsaccadic buffer that holds visual information from one fixation point to the next. Also, transaccadic memory does not hold detailed spatial information, but a more abstract representation. Irwin describes transaccadic memory as an undetailed, limited capacity memory that is relatively long-lasting.|$|E

The minimum <b>fixation</b> disparity was frequently reached directly after the post-saccadic drift, sometimes at the end of <b>fixation</b> and sometimes somewhere in between. Minimum <b>fixation</b> disparity was strongly influenced only by <b>fixation</b> position (within the sentence) while the amplitude of incoming saccade had a negligible effect. Moreover, the effect of <b>fixation</b> position on minimum <b>fixation</b> disparity was correlated with the individual ability to compensate for binocular disconjugacy (due to saccades) while fixating during reading.

25|$|The {{neighbouring}} rights, introduced for {{the first}} time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law. The law covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Visual <b>fixations</b> (videograms) were not covered. Neighbouring rights were, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to formalities except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast. Performers were granted the moral rights to attribution and to the integrity of the work. The exclusive economic rights comprised the rights to (re-)perform a performance, including a right to be remunerated for any reuses of a performance, and the rights to reproduction, recording, distribution, broadcasts, and rebroadcasts of a performance, a phonogram, or a broadcast. Phonogram producers were even granted an exclusive right to adaptations of their recordings, a provision that goes even beyond the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The 1993 law covered phonograms first published in Russia or created by a Russian person or company, broadcasts of broadcasting organizations having their legal residence in Russia, and performances of Russian artists, as wells as performances first performed in Russia, and also performances recorded or broadcast in Russia, if the record or broadcast was covered by the law.|$|E
25|$|Skilled readers {{move their}} eyes during {{reading on the}} average of every quarter of a second. During {{the time that the}} eye is fixated, new {{information}} is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms. The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired. There is considerable variability in <b>fixations</b> (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions. These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but only recently have researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of cognitive processing during reading.|$|E

25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (<b>fixations).</b> Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E

2500|$|There are 4 major {{cognitive}} systems {{involved in}} eye movement in reading: Language processing, attention, vision, and oculomotor control. Eye trackers bounce near infra-red light off {{the interior of}} the eyeball, and monitor the reflection on the eye to determine gaze location.

Wang (2011) mentioned that a video-based eye-tracker which uses video cameras to record the eye position of human subjects, thereby recording pupil dilation and eye movements, can be used to examine how <b>fixations,</b> saccades, and pupil dilation responses are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices during an experiment. According to Wang (2011:185), [...] "understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in.

2500|$|For those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on oculomotor processes, {{the aim is}} not to offer an overarching model that simulates reading behaviours comprehensively, but to investigate how some basic oculomotor processes may account qualitatively for some phenomena in reading behaviours.

Another model SERIF (McDonald, Carpenter, & Shillcock, 2005) studies the effect of fovea split on reading behaviours; the model extends fovea split to hemispheres difference and competition, and explains the IOVP effect (Vitu et al., 2001) which is regarded by E-Z Reader as an artifact of misallocated <b>fixations.</b> The advantage of this approach resides in that the oculomotor processes have material basis and may undercut some of those assumptions of lexical processes made by E-Z Reader and SWIFT.|$|E
2500|$|Irwin's early {{experiments}} tested participants {{ability to}} identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. The control condition for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point.

This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate <b>fixations,</b> forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds.

2500|$|McConkie's and Currie's saccade {{target theory}} {{is similar to}} {{research}} by Schneider {{who came up with}} a similar [...] "reference object theory". Both theories hypothesize that each saccade is preceded by processes in the visual system that chose an object as the target for the next fixation point. The object is usually located in peripheral vision. The object's features are stored as a mental representation in transsaccadic memory for identification of future <b>fixations.</b> These target features are searched for by the visual system when the eye lands on its fixation point, and [...] the physical features are compared to the mental representation of the target object. The theory assumes that visual stability is attained when these processes are successful (when the visual stimuli and the mental representation of the target object match). This process occurs before each saccade. Experiments performed by McConkie to support the role of a saccadic target in transsaccadic memory show two things: first, there is a limited peripheral area where a saccadic target exists, and second, attention is vital in recollection of items in the target area. The experiments involved recalling changes to an image that occurred in the peripheral area. Irwin performed similar experiments in which participants recalled letters that occurred near the target area. Due to confounding factors of the controlled environment in the studies, the involvement of saccade target objects is inferred and not established.|$|E
