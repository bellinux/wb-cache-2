5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (<b>Hevea</b> brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E

Phytophthora katsurae is distinguished from the similar R <b>heveae</b> by its verrucose oogonial wall. The number of protrusions produced by the Taiwanese isolates of P. katsurae varied greatly ranging from 2 to 23 per oogonium, indicating the unsteadiness of this taxonomical characteristic. Oogonia produced by isolates of P. katsurae obtained from Hawaii contained very few protrusions. Moreover, most oogonia produced by two of these isolates did not have any protrusions and were indistinguishable from those produced by P. <b>heveae.</b> Results suggest the development of P <b>heveae</b> directly from P. katsurae by loss of oogonial protrusions. The high level of ITS sequence similarity between P. <b>heveae</b> and P katsurae in comparison with their relationships to other Phytophthora species tested also support the possibility of the recent development of one species from the other species...|$|R

We focused on genes that are known to be important in the host–fungus interaction interface and that presumably have a role in determining the lifestyle of a fungus.

The X. <b>heveae</b> genome contains a low number of enzymes needed for plant cell wall degradation, suggesting that Xylona is a highly adapted specialist and likely dependent on its host for survival. The reduced repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes could reflect an adaptation to intercellulary growth and to the avoidance of the host's immune system, suggesting that Xylona has a strictly endophytic lifestyle. Phylogenomic data resolved the position of Xylonomycetes as sister to Lecanoromycetes and Eurotiomycetes and placed the beetle-endosymbiont Symbiotaphrina as a member of this class.

There is little information available {{at the molecular level}} regarding how a rubber tree develops defense mechanisms against this pathogen. We have studied rubber tree mRNA transcripts from the resistant RRIC 52 cultivar by differential display analysis. Leaves inoculated with the spores of O. <b>heveae</b> were collected from 0 to 120 hpi in order to identify pathogen-regulated genes at different infection stages. We identified 78 rubber tree genes that were differentially expressed during the plant–pathogen interaction. BLAST analysis for these 78 ESTs classified them into seven functional groups: cell wall and membrane pathways, transcription factor and regulatory proteins, transporters, signal transduction, phytoalexin biosynthesis, other metabolism functions, and unknown functions. The gene expression for eight of these genes was validated by qRT-PCR in both RRIC 52 and the partially susceptible Reyan 7 - 33 - 97 cultivars, revealing the similar or differential changes of gene expressions between these two cultivars. This study has improved our overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rubber tree resistance to powdery mildew...|$|R
50|$|<b>Hevea</b> benthamiana is {{a species}} of rubber tree in the genus <b>Hevea,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Euphorbiaceae. A medium-sized deciduous tree growing to a height of about 27 m, it is native to the rainforests of northern Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela.|$|E

It is native to the rainforests of Venezuela, the Guyanas, northern Brazil, Colombia and Peru. It grows on slopes and high river banks where it is not seasonally inundated.|$|E
40|$|The lace bug, Leptopharsa <b>heveae</b> is {{an insect}} that causes serious damage on rubber trees. In {{laboratory}} condition, {{the strains of}} Verticillium lecanii (ARSEF 6430, 6431 e 6432) and Aphanocladium album (ARSEF 6433) were tested on third-and fifth-instar nymphs and adults of L. <b>heveae</b> to evaluate their virulence using 2. 4 x 10 (5) and 2. 4 x 10 (7) conidia/mL. The bioassays were carried out using Petri dishes whose inner bottoms were covered with damp filter papers. Each Petri dish contained five insects and one rubber tree leaflet. The plates were covered with PVC film to provide high relative humidity, maintained at 26 +/- 0. 5 degrees C and a photophase of 14 hours. The Probit analysis was calculated from mortality date of insects killed by fungi. In the highest concentrations, ARSEF 6430 was more virulent for third instar nymphs, and the LT 50 was 1. 9 days. For the fifth instar, the strains ARSEF 6430, 6433 and 6432 showed similar virulence with LT 50 of 2. 6, 2. 6 and 3. 2 days, respectively. For adults, ARSEF 6431 was the most virulent strain with the LT 50 recorded at 2. 0 days. The smallest concentration did not always cause more than 50 % mortality...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{knowledge}} of the seasonal occurrence of mites can supply data for elaboration of programs of ecological management to be implanted with success in the future. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the species richness and the seasonality of mites present in two areas of rubber tree crops neighboring to native areas in Itiquira, MT. Along one year, 25 quantitative samplings were accomplished in rubber tree crop neighboring to two fragments of Cerrado (Cerradao and Mata Riparia). There were registered 199, 380 mites, of 48 species, belonging to 15 families. of those, 13 species are phytophagous, 18 predators and 17 mycophagous or of unknown alimentary habit. Three phytophagous species represented more than 97 % of the mites collected: Phyllocoptruta seringueirae Feres (80. 8 %), Tenuipalpus <b>heveae</b> Baker (12. 7 %) and Calacarus <b>heveae</b> Feres (3. 6 %). Among the predators, the most abundant species were Agistemus sp., Scirula sp. and Euseius concordis (Chant). Twenty-eight species were common to both crops. The families that had the largest number of species collected in the neighboring area to Cerradao were Tydeidae (7), Tarsonemidae (6), Eriophyidae and Phytoseiidae (4), and in the area close to Mata Riparia, Tydeidae (9) and Phytoseiidae (8). The presence of vegetation near the crop should explain the great number of species of mites classified as accidental found in this study. The largest abundances and species richness occurred in the end of the rainy season and beginning of the dry season...|$|R
50|$|Recently, {{molecular}} biology has provided new tools for identifying species and elucidating their relatedness. A study of ribosomal DNA from 33 samples of oak powdery mildew from Europe showed that E. alphitoides contains identical sequences to Oïdium mangiferae, a major disease of mango in several tropical regions and Oïdium <b>heveae,</b> an economically important pathogen of the para rubber tree. These {{results support the}} findings of Boesewinkel and suggest that E. alphitoides and O. mangiferae could be conspecific. The origin of the species is still uncertain but Mougou et. al (2008) reported that E. alphitoides likely originated from the tropics and expanded its range to oak after being introduced to Europe.|$|R
