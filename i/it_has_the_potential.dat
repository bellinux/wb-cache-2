5|$|The {{objective}} of the present state and regional policy is to carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. Ecotourism poses an ideal solution, since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the world}} {{are a variety of}} enemies, {{including}} standard fantasy monsters such as imps and goblins, and animals such as bears and wolves. Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up. This game mechanic of level-scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty. However, level-scaling combined with the leveling system has received criticism, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to unbalance the game; characters with major skills that increase on an involuntary basis, such as athletics or armor, can find that they level too quickly, making the enemies proportionately harder than intended.|$|E
5|$|When {{initially}} established, the F-FDTL land force comprised two light infantry battalions, {{each with}} an authorised strength of 600 personnel. Each battalion has three rifle companies, a support {{company and a}} headquarters company. Although the army is small, the guerrilla tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to form a credible deterrent against invasion. The Army's current doctrine is focused on low-intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter-insurgency tasks. Most of the force's training and operations are conducted at the section level, and company or battalion-sized exercises are rare.|$|E

5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

There are {{studies that show}} no actual increased risk of cancer from smoking marijuana, even when duration of use is expanded over several years. In fact, some studies indicate THC to have anticancer properties, with studies showing tumor reduction in mice.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{there was}} a spring close {{to the corner of}} Mulberry Street and Pearl Street near Blizzards Run. A 1909 report noted that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to become polluted. The spring was little-used in the early 1900s.

25|$|Introduction of {{invasive}} species {{is also a}} threat to the Amargosa vole. One extremely aggressive plant, tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), changes the vegetative community and the hydrology of the marsh. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to use so much water that it changes or even eliminates the standing water from the vole habitat. Two other introduced species, house cats and house mice, do not alter the ecosystem but directly impact the vole. House cats are known predators of the vole, but the relationship between the Amargosa vole and house mice is not as well understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit {{the capabilities of}} the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to become Siddha (God in Jainism). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.|$|E
25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Mourvèdre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility to mildew, with small thick-skinned berries that {{are high in}} both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can translate into a high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourvèdre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under {{many different kinds of}} vine training systems.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{nuclear power}} is a {{proposed}} means of generating power by use {{of a combination of}} nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the MTR and KCR {{started using}} the Octopus Access Control System {{as the main}} payment method for travel on its network, {{replacing}} the Common Stored Value Tickets. Octopus cards are rechargeable, contactless smart cards, thus {{the value of the}} money is digitally stored in the card, and the amount can be automatically calculated and deducted by Octopus card readers. The system was originally proposed and introduced by the MTR. It has been extended to different services such as minibuses, franchised buses, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to be further developed in other fields of services. The older, traditional magnetic ticketing system is also still in use for single journeys.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and {{cut into small pieces}} to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
