5|$|If that is so, {{it is not}} unthinkable that {{circumstances}} could arise {{where the}} courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism. <b>In</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances</b> involving an attempt to abolish judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or a new Supreme Court may have to consider {{whether this is a}} constitutional fundamental which even a sovereign Parliament acting at the behest of a complaisant House of Commons cannot abolish.|$|E
5|$|Only <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances</b> {{would there}} have been no dowry, since the lack of one could have been {{interpreted}} as proof that no legitimate marriage occurred. A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that her lack of a dowry did not concern him.|$|E

5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion.

5|$|Players {{may only}} be {{transferred}} during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from {{the last day of}} the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances.</b> This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.|$|E

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

25|$|Until 2004 Gurkhas {{were not}} allowed to settle in the United Kingdom. However, the Labour {{government}} under Tony Blair changed the rules so that Gurkhas who retired after 1997 would be allowed to settle in the UK, 1997 being the date when the Gurkha Brigade headquarters moved from Hong Kong to Britain. Soldiers who retired before this date, however, were only allowed the same settlement rights <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstance.</b> The Gurkha Justice Campaign wanted the same settlement rights for all Gurkha soldiers.|$|R

25|$|Maintaining {{financial}} stability involves protecting against {{threats to the}} whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions.

25|$|The {{exercise}} of the above powers {{is a matter of}} continuing debate. Many constitutional commentators believe that the Governor-General (or the Sovereign) does not have the power to refuse Royal Assent to legislation —former law professor and Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer and Professor Matthew Palmer argue that any refusal of Royal Assent would cause a constitutional crisis. However, some constitutional lawyers, such as Professor Philip Joseph, believe the Governor-General does retain the power to refuse Royal Assent to Bills <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> such as the abolition of democracy.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} Parliament Act 1949, these two acts enable the Commons (<b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstance)</b> to pass {{legislation}} without approval from the Lords but subject to certain time delays. In effect, they give the House of Lords the power to delay legislation but not to prevent it.Since 1911 there have been various attempts to reform the Lords, but none tackled {{the powers of the}} House except the Parliament Act 1949 which reduced the suspensory veto to two sessions and one year. By the time of the 1997 general election there was still no consensus on comprehensive reform of the upper chamber of Parliaments.|$|R

25|$|During {{the entire}} 15th century, {{a time of}} social and {{economical}} crisis all over Europe, the violence grew {{in a series of}} wars and insurrection that perturbed all of the Kingdom of Galicia; these insurrections were replies to the violence exerted by the bishops and the noblemen on the churchmen, artisans and peasants. The insurgents usually were organized in irmandades (meaning 'brotherhoods'), groups of men who <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and allegedly with the King's approval, armed themselves to act as a policemen in defence of peace and justice.|$|E

He appealed but this was rejected on 8 February 2007. His lawyer then announced an appeal to the Supreme Court which would, however, only be granted <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances</b> and can only affect the length of the sentence, not the guilty verdict.

25|$|If a town {{wishes to}} obtain {{the title of a}} city the proper method of {{procedure}} is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and <b>in</b> <b>exceptional</b> <b>circumstances</b> that the title is given.|$|E
