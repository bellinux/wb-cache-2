Ti Noel, after drinking, rapes Mademoiselle Floridor, who is Lenormand de Mezy's latest mistress. The uprising is defeated and Bouckman is killed.

Several of the rebels are gathered to be publicly executed, but Lenormand de Mezy secures the release of his slaves, including Ti Noel, intending to sell them in the slave markets in Cuba.

25|$|When Sun Quan was {{in control}} of the Wu territories, the lands were not very {{peaceful}} as the Shanyue tribes in the region often raided counties and caused much trouble. Huang Gai was sent to pacify the Shanyue. Once, Huang Gai was assigned to oversee Shicheng County (石城縣; present-day Shicheng County, Jiangxi), and he knew that the local officials did not follow the laws and were difficult to control. After entering the county office, he chose two officers to be his assistants and ordered them to manage the office. He also gave instructions for all the officers to abide by rules and regulations and perform their duties well. The two officers were afraid of Huang Gai so they put in full effort in their work. However, as time passed, they realised that Huang Gai did not inspect their work, so they became lax and reverted to their old ways. Huang Gai was actually aware of what had been going on. He invited all the local officials to attend a banquet later and exposed the two officers' misdeeds in front of everyone. The officers were <b>frightened</b> <b>and</b> started begging for their lives, but Huang Gai had them executed. This incident shocked everyone in the county. Huang Gai was later reassigned to be the Chief (長) of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui) and as the Prefect (令) of Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei). The nine counties under his governorship were peaceful and stable. Huang Gai was subsequently promoted to Commandant (都尉) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu).
