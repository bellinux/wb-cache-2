Clennell had three children with her partner; all had been taken into care and adopted due to her drug addiction. Clennell <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> spent some of her childhood in a referral unit, and it was shortly after being placed there that she started taking drugs.|$|E
5|$|The project, however, found strong resistance. As Carlota {{was married}} to John VI, a prince of Portugal, many people though that Carlotism was a trick to conceal Portuguese expansionism. Carlota <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> {{different}} political ideas than those of her supporters: Belgrano and the others shared the ideas of enlightenment, but Carlota aspired to keep the full power of an absolutist monarchy. By 1810 the project was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, {{arguing that}} feminists should not support or attempt to reform {{criminal}} obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under {{a law that}} she <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin {{did not support the}} decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily as part of a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E

5|$|At Kanshi Ram's funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati {{stated that}} both Kanshi Ram and <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> been, {{and she would}} {{continue}} to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was born}} {{an only child}} on 17 November 1876 in Jhansi, {{in the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, India. His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard, an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, died from typhoid six weeks before he was born, leading him to be raised alone by his mother, Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard. She <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> come from a {{military}} family, her father being Major-General Browne William Ryall.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying {{to come up with}} an explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|Bonstelle's mother, who <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> {{wanted to}} be an actress, home-schooled her in reading, writing, singing, dancing, and even in reciting Shakespeare. Jessie's first public {{performance}} was singing temperance songs in church at the age of two years. Helen gave her daughter a passion for acting by often taking her to theaters in nearby Rochester. Around the age of ten Jessie auditioned for critic Thomas Keane, and with his encouragement she left on tour with a production of Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Machine Girl, a melodrama. After returning home from California she briefly studied at Nazareth Academy, a convent school in Rochester. In 1886 she returned to the stage, working for local opera house owner Edward D. Stair and touring in his productions.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E
5|$|The {{fragmentary notes}} for the {{remainder}} of the novel indicate two different trajectories for the plot and five separate conclusions. In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and takes another mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an abortion or a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form a new family.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} Paris Flash {{claim that}} Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, {{on the basis}} of a misinterpreted interview with Professor Calculus. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine Tempo di Roma with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a magazine reporter.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E
5|$|After the Kneitals had {{rejected}} his request for initiation into Gardnerian Wicca, Buczynski met with another Gardnerian high priestess, Patricia Siero, who instead agreed to initiate both him and Slater. Siero <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> been initiated by Fran Fisher, high priestess of a coven located in Louisville, Kentucky, in June 1973, {{who in turn}} had claimed initiation from Rosemary Buckland. The weekend after returning from Kentucky, Siero initiated Buczynski and Slater through all three degrees of the Gardnerian tradition, entitling them to operate as high priests of their own covens. Buczynski decided to do so, founding his own Gardnerian coven with an older German woman named Renate Springer as high priestess that operated in the Brooklyn Heights area. Nevertheless, the Kneitals refused to accept Buczynski's Gardnerian credentials, asserting that Rosemary Buckland had never actually initiated Fran Fischer up to the third degree. As {{a result of the}} Kneitals' claims, the Gardnerian community in the Northeastern United States widely refused to accept the Brooklyn Heights coven as legitimate, and Siero decided to take up the Kneitals' offer for re-initiation; as a result, she disowned the initiations of Buczynski and Slater which she had carried out. Springer was uneasy at the situation, and decided to depose Buczynski from his position as high priest, replacing him with one of her initiates, Gilbert Littlebear.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2013, {{a second}} European leg through 2014 was {{announced}} {{bringing the total}} number of shows to 132, thus becoming Beyoncé's longest running tour to date. Similar to the first European leg, a frenzied rush for tickets, further enhanced by the release of the singer's self-titled fifth studio album three days before ticket sales began, resulted in extra dates being added for all United Kingdom shows, Dublin, Cologne, Amsterdam and Antwerp. For the second European leg, Beyoncé had beaten the record she <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> set earlier in the year, by selling 40,000 tickets in under one hour for the two 2014 concerts at Antwerp. Pollstar ranked The Mrs. Carter Show at number 2 on its year-end chart of the top twenty grossing worldwide tours with a gross of $188.6 million from the 2013 shows. Tickets were sold with an average gross of $2,449,248 per city. In April 2014, Billboard reported that Beyoncé's 2014 European shows grossed $41.1 million and played for an audience of 384,730. This brought The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour's total gross to $229.7 million when combined with the 107 shows performed in 2013, and the total attendance to 2,082,848, averaging 15,779 attendance and $1.74 million gross per night. The tour is Beyoncé's highest grossing to date before being surpassed by The Formation World Tour which grossed over $256 million, and one of the highest grossing tours of the decade.|$|E

5|$|Manuel's {{death on}} 24 September 1180, marked {{a turning point}} in the {{fortunes}} of the Byzantine Empire. When Manuel died, he was succeeded by his young son Alexios II Komnenos, who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria. Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Manuel's estranged cousin, Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1183–1185), son of Isaac Komnenos. Andronikos left his retirement in 1182, and marched on Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents. His arrival was soon followed by a massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the Venetian merchants who were settled in some numbers in Constantinople. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister Maria the Porphyrogenita and her husband Renier of Montferrat, although Maria <b>herself</b> <b>had</b> encouraged him to intervene. The poisoner was said to be the eunuch Pterygeonites. Soon afterwards he had the empress Maria imprisoned and then killed, by Pterygeonites and the hetaireiarches Constantine Tripsychos. Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire, but was then put to death; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos and Stephen Hagiochristophorites. Andronikos, by 1183 sole emperor, married Agnes of France, a child twelve years of age who had been formerly betrothed to Alexios II. Agnes was a daughter of King Louis VII of France and his third wife Adèle of Champagne. By November 1183, Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne.|$|E
