5000|$|This latch {{exploits}} {{the fact}} that, {{in the two}} active input combinations (01 and 10) of a gated SR latch, R is the complement of S. The input NAND stage converts the two D input states (0 and 1) to these two input combinations for the next [...] latch by inverting the data input signal. The low state of the enable signal produces the inactive [...] "11" [...] combination. Thus a gated D-latch may {{be considered as a}} one-input synchronous SR latch. This configuration prevents application of the restricted input combination. It is also known as transparent latch, <b>data</b> <b>latch,</b> or simply gated latch. It has a data input and an enable signal (sometimes named clock, or control). The word transparent comes from the fact that, when the enable input is on, the signal propagates directly through the circuit, from the input D to the output Q.|$|E

In this paper a new method for reducing the power consumption of dynamic circuits is presented. The proposed technique is especially suitable for large fan-in gates where the dynamic node discharges very frequently. These kinds of gates are widely used in high performance applications like microprocessors. The proposed method is used in an 8 -input NOR gate and an 8 -input OR gate. The power-delay product of these gates is reduced by 46. 7 % and 35. 15 %, respectively in the 90 nm CMOS technology, compared to their conventional dynamic counterparts.

Usually pulse-triggered flip-flops have specific structures and transistor sizes to optimize the system performance. The transistor size, topology, and threshold voltage of the flip-flop make the timing characteristics sensitive to the supply voltage. The transparent windows generated and required in a pulse-triggered flip-flop may have mismatch under different supply voltages (scaling), which is likely to result in system timing and functional failures. in single edge adaptive pulse trigger flip-flops the latching speed is less, no of transistors are more and power dissipation also high so to overcome these limitations dual edge adaptive pulse triggered flip flop is proposed. Proposed structure improves the robustness of adaptive pulse-triggered flip-flops and promises this high-speed clocked element for wide range of supply voltages so <b>data</b> <b>latching</b> speed is increase, numbers of transistors were reduced and power dissipation also reduced.

30|$|Overall, the {{operation}} of the circuit is to select input DATA and pass it on the output channel, Q. As it is illustrated in Fig. 1, the circuit is a synchronous multiplexer that can transmit multiple data simultaneously to output Q based on both edges of CLOCK pulse. In close view, to analyse the performance of circuit, two NMOSs of M 17 and M 18 were connected to each inverter module (one is M 13 and M 14, the other is M 15 and M 16) in order to boost their outputs. Back to back connected inverters keep the data when transmission gate is off. At the same time multiplexer transmits this <b>latched</b> <b>data</b> to the inverter to pass the correct DATA on the output line Q. Based on Fig. 1, when the CLOCK is low the MOSFETs M 3, M 4 and M 18 are all on while M 5, M 6 and M 17 are all off. Hence DATA is hold by negative latch and is passed to output line Q. In contrast, whenever CLOCK is high then the MOSFETs M 5, M 6 and M 17 will be on but the MOSFETs M 3, M 4 and M 18 will be off. In this state, DATA is passed on the output channel Q. So that, in dual edge-triggered D flip-flip DATA is put forward to output through both low and high states of CLOCK. Before the next CLOCK, if DATA alters this new amount of DATA is held by positive edge <b>latch</b> <b>data</b> PELD part and whenever next CLOCK comes and changes from Low to High this DATA is conveyed to the output channel Q. On the contrary, before the following CLOCK, if DATA changes this new DATA is hold by Negative Edge <b>Latch</b> <b>Data</b> NELD part and once next CLOCK arrives and alters from High to Low the DATA reach to the output channel Q. Without using M 19, M 20, M 21, M 22, M 23, and M 24 the output does not reach to the standard value of high or low level and there will be some transient time states for output signals. They should be a series of standard pulses since the input data is in fact a series of standard pulses.|$|R

The traditional 4 -phase dual-rail requires the input {{to be of}} alternating valid and empty cycles.
