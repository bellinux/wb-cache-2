40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of regional councils' Water Quality Plans implemented under the Resource Management Act (1991), many farmers in New Zealand are now irrigating effluent farm dairy effluent. However there are situations where irrigation is not practicable and it is considered that a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treatment system may provide a highly treated effluent able to be discharged directly to waterways. The objectives of this research were to develop an SBR operating strategy to optimise biological nutrient removal from farm dairy <b>effluent,</b> <b>monitor</b> the effectiveness of a pilot-scale SBR at removing nitrogen and phosphorus, and assess whether the untreated effluent could be made more readily biodegradable by prefermentation. An operating strategy was designed to enable biological nutrient removal, with the aim of achieving low phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate effluent concentrations. The SBR operating strategy is Fill, Anaerobic, Aerobic I, Anoxic, Aerobic II, Settle, and Decant. Phosphorus is released in the anaerobic phase, using the readily biodegradable carbon. The first aerobic phase is used tor nitrification and phosphorus uptake. Remaining readily biodegradable carbon is also oxidised thus the denitrification occurring in the anoxic phase depends entirely on endogenous carbon. The final aerobic phase operates as a polisher. The results show that the SBR did not achieve biological nutrient removal: there was no apparent reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the effluent. The most likely reason for the SBR's failure to operate as expected is that it was operated on settled effluent rather than raw farm dairy effluent. The prefermentation trial aimed to increase the readily biodegradable carbon to improve phosphorus removal. The results showed that the optimal time for prefermentation of raw farm dairy effluent at 20 °C was eight to ten days, when VFA oxygen demand peaked at about 2, 100 mg/L. The prefermentation trial showed a lag phase of 0 to 2 days. The VFA proportions obtained in this experiment were 1. 0 : 0. 3 : 0. 14 : 0. 08 acetic : propionic : butyric : valeric acids. The SBR is likely to operate as part of a total treatment system, designed to enhance BNR and provide a high quality effluent. It is considered that screened farm dairy effluent would be held in a prefermentation pond with a hydraulic retention time of at least 8 to 10 days. Prefermented effluent would be treated in the SBR. The effluent would then be polished using wetlands. KEYWORDS: Sequencing batch reactor; prefermentation; farm dairy effluent; nitrogen removal; phosphorus removal; volatile fatty acids...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of gaseous emissions from cyclotron sites during {{the production of}} positron emitters for use in nuclear imaging is a public safety issue, and operators are required to measure any such emissions accurately. Despite the fact that stack <b>effluent</b> <b>monitor</b> instrumentation has been available for several years, a suitable calibration facility does not exist. Traceability to a primary standard is essential if such measurements are to be accurate. This project focused {{on the development of}} a primary standard based on a system already established at NPL for the standardisation of beta-emitters such as 85 Kr and 133 xe. Previous standardisations of beta+-emitters have been carried out using liquid or solid sources. Unlike the previously mentioned standardisation methods for positron emitters (which have been carried out using liquid or solid sources), a primary standard for positron emitters in gas has been developed, which can be used to calibrate the instrumentation used at PET/cyclotron sites. 11 C was chosen as the radionuclide to be standardised, 18 F, 15 O and 13 N could not be used because of experimental factors. To provide an active gas sample suitable for counting and to provide a comparison with an existing standard based on measurement of a liquid, a method has been developed for conversion of sodium bicarbonate to carbon dioxide with subsequent drying and trapping of the gas. A sample of 11 C liberated in this way was measured by internal gas proportional counting using a system of three counters. This document describes the standardisation of 11 C by gas counting and the comparison of the primary standardisation results with an independent measurement of a sample of the same sodium bicarbonate solution that was used to generate the active gas. The independent measurement was carried out using a secondary standard ion chamber. The experimental determination of counting losses in internal gas proportional counting was difficult. Some of the losses for standardizing 11 C, 13 N, 15 O 18 F have been calculated using the PENELOPE Monte Carlo Code. The PENELOPE code was selected {{for the study of the}} counting losses because it was the most suitable code for positron interaction simulation at the time of this work. The correction factors calculated with PENELOPE were less than 0. 6 % for the system of the three counters used as the primary standard.
