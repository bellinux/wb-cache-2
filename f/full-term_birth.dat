A similar effect has not yet been reported among women who carry an inherited BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. We conducted a matched case–control study on 1816 pairs of women with a BRCA 1 (n = 1405) or BRCA 2 (n = 411) mutation in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between {{age at first}} full-term pregnancy and the risk of developing breast cancer. Information about the age at first childbirth and other pregnancy-related variables was derived from a questionnaire administered to women during the course of genetic counselling. There was no difference in the mean age at first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> in the cases and controls (24. 9 years vs. 24. 8 years; P = 0. 81, respectively). Compared to women whose first child was born at or before 18 years of age, a later age at first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> did not influence the risk of developing breast cancer (OR = 1. 00 per year; 95 % CI 0. 98 – 1. 03; P-trend = 0. 67).

These findings suggest that an early first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> does not confer protection against breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers.

Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women with incident breast cancer, aged 30 - 74 years and diag-nosed between 1992 and 1994, were identified by the New Mexico Tumor Registry. Controls were selected using random digit dialing and frequency matched by ethnicity, age, and region. Information on reproductive history, lactation, and other risk factors was collected through in-person interviews; 719 Hispanics and 836 non-Hispanic whites {{were included in the}} analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk of breast cancer for reproductive factors and to assess ethnic differences in effects. Older age at first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> was associated with breast cancer among Hispanics; the odds ratio for women aged 27 years and older at first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> compared with women 18 years or younger was 2. 26 (95 % confidence interval 1. 17 - 4. 38) compared with 1. 60 (95 % confidence interval 0. 86 - 3. 01) for non-Hispanic whites. Higher parity was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer for non-Hispanic whites, but not Hispanics (p < 0. 008).

40|$|The African-American {{population}} of McNary, Arizona, resides {{at an altitude}} of 2200 m. The lengthy winters are typically quite cold; the monthly mean temperature from November to April is 1. 8 °C. Data from 318 singleton <b>full-term</b> <b>births</b> of African-American babies from 1949 to 1972 show a mean weight of 3095 g (s. d. = 427 g). At birth 1. 9 % of the babies weighed at least 4 kg; 9. 7 % weighed less than 2. 5 kg. These data suggest that altitude may have influenced birth weight in this sample. Significant patterns in birth weight exist for sex, parity, mother’s age, and severity of the winter preceding the year of birth. The birth weight of female babies born following warm winters is significantly lighter than those born during years following cold winters. There are relatively fewer high-birth-weight babies, in comparison to other African-American populations.

40|$|Abstract The {{fact that}} {{reproductive}} factors have signifi-cant {{influence on the}} risk of breast cancer is well known. Early age of first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> is highly protective against late-onset breast cancers, but each pregnancy, including the first one, increases the risk of early-onset breast cancer. Estradiol and progesterone induce receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) in estrogen receptor (ER) - and progesterone receptor (PgR) -positive luminal cells. RANKL then acts in a paracrine fashion on the membranous RANK of ER/PgR-negative epithelial stem cells of the breast. This reaction cascade is triggered by chorionic gonadotropin during the first trimester of pregnancy and results in the morphological and functional development of breast tissue. On the other hand, the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the early steps of weaning protects against tumor growth through reduction of the acute inflammatory reaction of post lactation remodeling of breast tissue. This is experimental evidence that may explain the short-term tumor-promoting effect of pregnancy. The pro-tective effect of prolonged breast feeding may also be explained, at least in a part, by a reduced inflammatory reaction due to gradual weaning. Delay of first birth together with low parity and short duration of breast feeding are increasing social trends in developed countries. Therefore, breast cancer risk as a result of reproductive factors will not decrease in these countries in the foreseeable future. In this review, the significance of reproductive history with regard to {{the risk of breast}} cancers will be discussed, focusing on the age of first <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> and post lactation involution of the breast...|$|E

In recent years, numerous recommendations have been made concerning {{the importance of the}} physiological process during birth. In Spain and Catalonia, work has been carried out to implement evidence-based practices for childbirth and to reduce unnecessary interventions. To identify obstetric intervention rates among all births, determine whether there are differences in interventions among <b>full-term</b> single <b>births</b> taking place in different hospitals according to type of funding and volume of births attended to, and to ascertain whether there is an association between caesarean section or instrumental birth rates and type of funding, the volume of births attended to and women’s age. Methods: Cross-sectional study, taking the hospital as the unit of analysis, obstetric interventions as dependent variables, and type of funding, volume of births attended to and maternal age as explanatory variables. The analysis was performed in three phases considering all births reported in the MBDS Catalonia 2011 (7, 8570 <b>births),</b> <b>full-term</b> single <b>births</b> and births coded as normal.

Design: Randomised, open-label, prospective trial (www. controlledtrials. com, number ISRCTN 35766970). Method: 404 patients were assigned to undergo either a mild treatment, consisting of ovarian stimulation with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist combined with single embryo transfer, or the standard treatment consisting of prolonged stimulation with a GnRH agonist combined with the transfer of two embryos. The primary outcome measures were: (1) the percentage of cumulative pregnancies within one year after randomisation leading to full-term live birth; (2) total costs per couple and child up to 6 weeks after expected delivery; and (3) overall patient discomfort. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle and was intended to show that the mild treatment was not inferior to the standard treatment; the non-inferiority threshold was - 12. 5 %. Results: The proportion of cumulative pregnancies resulting in <b>full-term</b> live <b>birth</b> after 1 year was 43. 4 % in the mild and 44. 7 % in the standard treatment group. The lower limit of the one-sided 95 % confidence interval was equal to - 9. 8 %. The respective proportion of couples with multiple pregnancies was 0. 5 % versus 13. 1 % (p < 0. 0001), and the average total costs were Euro 8, 333. - versus Euro 10, 745. - (difference: Euro 2, 412. -, 95 % CI: 703 - 4, 131).

This review analyses the effect of LPT and ET births on long-term cognitive and educational outcomes. The primary outcome was general cognitive ability. Secondary outcomes included verbal/non-verbal intelligence quotient, subject-specific school performance and special educational needs. The search strategy included Medline and Embase from January 1975 to June 2013. Eligible studies investigated specified outcomes and included suitable gestational age participants assessed at 2 [*]years and older. Outcome measures and socio-demographic descriptors were extracted, and data meta-analysed where possible.

Furthermore, the timing of deciduous tooth eruption seems more closely associated with postnatal weight than with birth weight. Although indices of nutritional deficiencies are associated with retarded tooth eruption, the use of mean number of deciduous teeth erupted as an estimate of mean chronological age in populations living under conditions of mild-to-moderate malnutrition is relatively accurate because errors of age estimation based on mean values for the present sample only vary between I and 2 months.

40|$|The {{phospholipid}} {{extracts from}} each of eleven samples of human amniotic fluid obtained from eleven <b>full-term</b> <b>births</b> were deposited as orientated monolayers adsorbed to glass. The surfaces {{were found to be}} rendered hydrophobic with maximum contact angles averaging 54. 5 degrees while, upon withdrawing fluid, the edge of the saline pool receded to expose dry surface with minimum contact angles averaging 15. 4 degrees. The extracts were found to be surface-active at the liquid-air interface and there was some indication that direct adsorption to solid surfaces was facilitated by calcium ions. It was found that, in all extracts, a continuous layer of saline adjacent to the adsorbed surface would break up spontaneously to expose dry surface when the thickness was reduced to an average of 764 micron, corresponding to several alveolar diameters. This phenomenon is discussed as a possible means of establishing dry patches on the alveolar membrane, especially in the new-born after the fetal alveolar wall has been exposed to the same surfactants in much the same physical form as found in amniotic fluid. Surfactant adsorbed directly to the tissue subphase is suggested as a physical basis for the discontinuity of the aqueous hypophase seen in many electron micrographs of the adult alveolus.

CSF-i was already detectable at iO weeks gestation in spleen, intestine, lung, kidney, heart, and liver in order of decreasing concentration, but a positive correlation with gestational age was seen only in lung and intestine. Although a 4. 4 -kb CSF-i mRNA was detectable in all tissues at all gestational ages, increased expression with advancing gestational age was observed in lung and kidney, whereas a rise and fall was observed in spleen. We conclude that CSF-i concentration in the human circulation is developmentally regulated and that its expression in fetal tissues is compatible with its role in regulating the development of tissue mononuclear phagocytes...|$|E
40|$|An 8 -year-old {{right-handed}} {{girl with}} a history of de-clining school performance presented to the emer-gency center with acute onset altered mental status. For 3 weeks, the former straight A student had been failing classes, but her family noted no changes in her personality or ability to perform activities of daily living. On the night of presentation, the patient was found minimally responsive, lying in vomitus. She aroused briefly with stimulation but was limp. Her past medical history was significant for a <b>full-term</b> <b>birth</b> without complications, normal acquisition of developmental milestones, and no chronic medical conditions. She took no medications. She had no un-usual food or animal exposures and had not traveled overseas. Her family had no history of seizures, strokes, blood clots, cancer, rheumatologic disorders, or recurrent miscarriages. On examination, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. Her examination was significant only for lethargy and bilateral papill-edema. Initial workup revealed a normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and blood glucose. Question for consideration: 1. What is the most appropriate next diagnostic study...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the exocrine pancreas has been determined quantitatively in 31 infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) both with and without meconium ileus and in 29 control infants. In the normal pancreas, the ratio of acinar to connective tissue volume is 0. 5 at 32 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) and increases linearly to 2. 0 at 52 weeks PGA. In cystic fibrosis infants, with or without meconium ileus, the ration is 0. 5 at 35 weeks PCA anddecreases linearly to 0. 3 at 52 weeks PCA. The volume of acinar and duct lumens is greater in CF than control infants but is independent of age or acinar volume. The {{development of}} the exocrine pancreas in infants with CF with and without meconium ileus diverges from the normal pattern: There is consistent lack of exocrine tissue before or a <b>full-term</b> <b>birth,</b> which persists throghout the age range of this study. CF infants above 42 weeks PCA can be discriminated from controls {{on the basis of}} the quantitative assessment of acinar volume...|$|E
40|$|Women {{with higher}} parity {{have a lower}} risk of ovarian cancer {{possibly}} because of pregnancy hormones, but the specific effect of different pregnancy hormones on ovarian cancer risk is not clear. Some clarification might be gained by considering situations where hormone levels vary between pregnancies. Study participants from an Australian population-based, case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer (2001 - 2005) completed a reproductive/lifestyle questionnaire. The authors included 1, 203 cases and 1, 286 controls with at least 1 birth and, using multiple logistic regression, calculated odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals to investigate the effects of pregnancy-related factors on cancer risk. Women who had 1 or more preterm births had higher risks of ovarian cancer {{than those who had}} only <b>full-term</b> <b>births</b> (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 48, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 02, 2. 15). The authors also found that bearing only boys was associated with a 2 -fold increased risk of mucinous ovarian cancer (OR = 2. 19, 95 % CI: 1. 15, 4. 17). There was no association between multiple pregnancy and ovarian cancer (for any multiple pregnancy vs. only singleton pregnancies: OR = 1. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 74, 2. 02). The results suggest that pregnancies associated with differing hormonal milieux have different effects on ovarian cancer risk and that some of these associations may vary with histologic subtype...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Birthweight by {{gestational age}} charts enable fetal growth to be {{evaluated}} in a specific population. Given that maternal profile and obstetric practice have undergone a remarkable change {{over the past few}} decades in Spain, this paper presents new Spanish reference percentile charts stratified by gender, parity and type of delivery. They have been prepared with data from the 2010 – 2014 period of the Spanish Birth Statistics Bulletin. Methods: Reference charts have been prepared using the LMS method, corresponding to 1, 428, 769 single, live births born to Spanish mothers. Percentile values and mean birth weight are compared among newborns according to gender, parity and type of delivery. Results: Newborns to primiparous mothers show significantly lower birthweight than those born to multiparous mothers (p <  0. 036). Caesarean section was associated with a substantially lower birthweight in preterm births (p <  0. 048), and with a substantially higher birthweight for full-term deliveries (p <  0. 030). Prevalence of small for gestational age is significantly higher in newborns born by Caesarean section, both in primiparous (p <  0. 08) and multiparous mothers (p <  0. 027) and, conversely, the prevalence of large for gestational age among <b>full-term</b> <b>births</b> is again greater both in primiparous (p <  0. 035) and in multiparous mothers (p <  0. 007). Conclusions: Results support the consideration of establishing parity and type of delivery-specific birthweight references. These new charts enable a better evaluation of the impact of the demographic, reproductive and obstetric trends currently in Spain on fetal growth...|$|R
