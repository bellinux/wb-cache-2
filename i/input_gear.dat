5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an <b>input</b> sun <b>gear</b> connected to the driver’s steering wheel, two {{planetary gear}}s, an output sun gear connected to the steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the <b>input</b> sun <b>gear,</b> thought the planetary gears (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output sun gear with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{input torque}} T'A {{acting on the}} <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> G'A is {{transformed}} by the gear train into the output torque T'B exerted by the output gear G'B. [...] If we assume, that the gears are rigid {{and that there are}} no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of virtual work can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gear train}} is formed by {{mounting}} gears on a frame {{so that the}} teeth of the gears engage. [...] Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, this provides a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next. [...] For this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the <b>input</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} {{if the number of}} teeth on the output gear GB is larger than the number of teeth on the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> GA, then the <b>input</b> <b>gear</b> GA must rotate faster than the output gear GB.|$|E
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features external gear teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output sun gear independently of the <b>input</b> sun <b>gear</b> position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the <b>input</b> sun <b>gear)</b> stationary, driving the {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|R

50|$|If {{the output}} gear of {{a gear train}} rotates more slowly than the <b>input</b> <b>gear,</b> then the gear train is called a speed reducer. In this case, because the output gear must have more teeth than the <b>input</b> <b>gear,</b> the speed reducer amplifies the input torque.|$|E

50|$|The Indy 500 {{version of}} the PC-23, showed a much higher engine cover, {{required}} {{because of the new}} engine. Other modifications included changes to the <b>input</b> <b>gears</b> of the gearbox, to cope with the lower rpm and higher power and torque the pushrod engine provided. However, the two versions of the gearbox were of the same weight, thus causing no shift in the weight balance. The Mercedes-Benz 500I engine was slightly lighter than the Ilmor Indy V8, although because of its longer inlets the center of gravity of the entire engine was higher than that of the 500I, thus changing the overall balance of the car a bit. The development and testing of the 500I engine, at that time called Ilmor 265E, took place in the utmost secrecy, because there was a possibility of the turbocharger boost level being changed, or the engine being banned by the Indy 500 sanctioning body.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although malaria {{has been}} {{the leading cause of}} fever for many years, with {{improved}} control regimes malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality have decreased. Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated the importance of non-malaria fevers, which have significantly improved our understanding of etiologies of febrile illnesses. A number of non-malaria febrile illnesses including Rift Valley Fever, dengue fever, Chikungunya virus infection, leptospirosis, tick-borne relapsing fever and Q-fever have been reported in Tanzania. This study aimed at assessing the awareness of communities and practices of health workers on non-malaria febrile illnesses. METHODS: Twelve focus group discussions with members of communities and 14 in-depth interviews with health workers were conducted in Kilosa district, Tanzania. Transcripts were coded into different groups using MaxQDA software and analyzed through thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The study revealed that the awareness of the study participants on non-malaria febrile illnesses was low and many community members believed that most instances of fever are due to malaria. In addition, the majority had inappropriate beliefs about the possible causes of fever. In most cases, non-malaria febrile illnesses were considered following a negative Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT) result or persistent fevers after completion of anti-malaria dosage. Therefore, in the absence of mRDTs, there is over diagnosis of malaria and under diagnosis of non-malaria illnesses. Shortages of diagnostic facilities for febrile illnesses including mRDTs were repeatedly reported as a major barrier to proper diagnosis and treatment of febrile patients. CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the need for creating community awareness on other causes of fever apart from malaria. Based on our study, appropriate treatment of febrile patients will require <b>inputs</b> <b>geared</b> towards strengthening of diagnostic facilities, drugs availability and optimal staffing of health facilities...|$|R
