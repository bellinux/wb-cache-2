5|$|The {{following}} season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, {{this time}} in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated {{at the end of the}} 2008–09 campaign. Mowbray left the club to manage Celtic and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo, who led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt, but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson. May 2012 saw Roy Hodgson, having led West Brom to a tenth-place finish in his first season, leave to become the manager of the England national team. Steve Clarke then led Albion to an eighth-place finish in 2012–13, their highest in the Premier League, but was sacked halfway through the following season and replaced by Pepe Mel, who left by mutual consent at the end of the campaign. After the brief tenure of Alan Irvine, Tony Pulis was appointed head coach on 1 January 2015. On 5 August 2016, it was announced the club had been sold to a Chinese <b>investment</b> <b>club</b> headed up by Guochuan Lai, and John Williams replaced Peace as chairman.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid {{clubs are}} a {{combination}} {{of two or more}} of the above types of <b>investment</b> <b>clubs.</b> Typically, real estate <b>investment</b> <b>clubs</b> are lower in risk and provide higher returns of 21% to 70% than stock, mutual fund or bond <b>investment</b> <b>clubs</b> due to the ongoing need for housing and population growth. Business <b>investment</b> <b>clubs</b> have about equal risk when compared to stock, mutual fund or bond <b>investment</b> <b>clubs.</b> However, business <b>investment</b> <b>clubs</b> have several additional benefits which include significantly higher returns and lower operating expenses measured by the net profit per year divided by the amount of cash necessary to purchase the business. Additionally, you can also hire yourself or family members to work in the business as employees.|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s, the United States {{underwent}} a dramatic transformation: investing in stocks, once {{the province of}} a privileged elite, became a mass activity involving {{more than half of}} Americans. Pop Finance follows the trajectory of this new market populism via the rise of <b>investment</b> <b>clubs,</b> through which millions of people across the socioeconomic spectrum became investors for the first time. As sociologist Brooke Harrington shows, these new investors pour billions of dollars annually into the U. S. stock market and hold significant positions in some of the nation's largest firms. Drawing upon Harrington's long-term observation of <b>investment</b> <b>clubs,</b> along with in-depth interviews and extensive survey data, Pop Finance is the first book to examine the origins and impact of this mass engagement in investing. One of Harrington's most intriguing findings is that gender-based differences in investing can create a "diversity premium" – groups of men and women together are more profitable than single-sex groups. In examining the sources of this effect, she delves into the interpersonal dynamics that distinguish effective decision-making groups from their dysfunctional counterparts. In addition, Harrington shows that most Americans approach investing not only to make a profit but also to make a statement. In effect, portfolios have become like consumer products, serving both utilitarian and social ends. This ties into the growth of socially responsible investing and shareholder activism – matters relevant not only to social scientists but also to corporate leaders, policymakers, and the millions of Americans planning for retirement.
