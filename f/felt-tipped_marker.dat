5000|$|Copies of remaindered books may {{be marked}} by the publisher, distributor, or {{bookseller}} {{to prevent them from}} being returned. [...] "Remainder marks" [...] have varied over the years, but today most remainders are marked with a stroke with a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>marker</b> across the top or bottom of the book's pages, near the spine.|$|E
50|$|While {{the obvious}} use of {{drafting}} tape is for drawing, drafting tape {{can also be}} used for labeling and hanging posters. Its neutral cream coloring goes well with many other colors, and it can be written on easily with any <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>marker.</b> In addition, drafting tape costs less than conventional labels, and its low cost also makes it more forgiving of errors.|$|E
5000|$|Lee Newman {{patented}} a felt-tipped marking pen in 1910. In 1926, Benjamin Paskach patented a [...] "fountain paintbrush" [...] as {{he called}} it which consisted of a sponge-tipped handle containing various paint colors. Markers of this sort began to be popularized with the sale of Sidney Rosenthal's Magic Marker (1953) which consisted of a glass tube of ink with a felt wick. By 1958, use of <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>markers</b> was commonplace for a variety of applications such as lettering, labeling, and creating posters. The year 1962 brought the development of the modern fiber-tipped pen (in contrast to the marker, which generally has a thicker point) by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company (which later became Pentel).|$|R
30|$|We sampled {{small mammals}} during 12 {{sampling}} periods, three periods (one year) prior to treatment and nine periods (three years) following treatment. After an initial sampling period in summer 2000, we sampled regularly each winter (February through March), spring (May through June), and summer (July through August), through spring 2004. Within each sampling period, all plots were sampled within {{a span of}} three to four weeks. We used an 8 × 8 grid of Sherman live traps spaced 12.5 m apart to sample small mammals on each plot. Traps were baited with wild bird seed and a mixture of peanut butter and oats, set at dusk, and checked at dawn every day for five consecutive days. We recorded species and body measurements from all animals captured. Animals were individually double-marked with a numbered ear tag and permanent <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>markers,</b> and animals were released {{at the site of}} capture. Animal-handing procedures were approved by the University of Arizona IACUC (protocols 99 - 121, 02 - 109).|$|R
50|$|A font, {{released}} in 1992, designed to resemble informal cursive handwriting with modern plastic-tipped or <b>felt-tipped</b> pens or <b>markers.</b> In 2014, Bigelow & Holmes added additional weights and widths to the family.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light pen}} allows {{the user to}} [...] "draw", to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a {{photo-detector}} that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen's position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype {{was made in the}} plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>marker</b> pen. The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen's location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen's position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.|$|E
40|$|Accurate, durable {{pre-operative}} skin marking that withstands {{the necessary}} vigorous surgical skin preparation on the theatre table minimises confusion {{and the risk}} of mistakes occurring perioperatively, as well as assisting the surgeon with the technicalities of required skin incisions. <b>Felt-tipped</b> <b>marker</b> pens vary widely in achieving these objectives. A selection of markers, including a number used by junior surgical staff on the wards, was investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{examination}} of any current type specimen book invariably discloses {{a large number}} of faces designed to imitate some form of handwriting. Strictly speaking, such designs are known as script types. It is a matter of opinion which typefaces should be classified as scripts, especially since all early type designs were derived from written forms. Today, we typically label a typeface as a script if it retains the look of having been written with a pen or other writing implement. Type specimen catalogues of the nineteenth century list numerous examples of such written forms, though these are mostly restricted to styles developed by the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writing masters. Modern scripts differ from those of the last century because of a bewildering variety of structures derived from forms created by different writing instruments, including the broad-edged pen, the steel pen, and the brush. In addition to such traditional sources, more recent scripts have been inspired by the <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>marker,</b> pencil, ruling pen, ball point pen and even the spray paint can. For this thesis project, the author prepared a historical introduction and then attempted to classify as many historic and contemporary script faces as possible in order to determine how type designers are breaking new ground in the structure of these fascinating letterforms. Many recent script faces are radically different from traditional models, while some explore the very limits of style, legibility, and technical fit. Such experimentation would have been much more difficult in the days when types were cast from metal or even when types were made for photocomposition devices. Today, the number and variety of script faces are increasing at a rapid rate due to improvements in computer type design software. Therefore, this thesis project also reviews some of the powerful type design software and digital technology now available which allow designers to create types of great originality. Also included are the results of a questionnaire sent to selected contemporary designers of script faces...|$|E
50|$|Set in Paris, {{the story}} {{revolves}} around three {{upper middle class}} friends—Serge, Marc and Yvan—who find their previously solid 15-year friendship on shaky ground when Serge buys an expensive painting. The canvas is white, with a few white lines, and highly valued among Serge's current circle of peers for ambiguous reasons. Serge is proud of his 200,000 franc acquisition, fully expecting the approval of his friends. However, Marc openly tries to convey his bemusement to Serge over his investment, while privately being bewildered at the purchase's implications and Serge's increasing dismissal. He goes to Yvan's apartment to discuss the matter, finding him searching frantically for a <b>felt-tipped</b> permanent <b>marker.</b>|$|R
