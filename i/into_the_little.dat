5|$|The mining washed {{hundreds}} of thousands of tons of earth and sediment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Applegate and its tributaries, devastated the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most mining operations had ended, and it was closed in 1918. Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|General Robert E. Lee {{commanded}} the Army of Northern Virginia, while Major General John Brown Gordon commanded its Second Corps. Early {{in the morning}} of April 9, Gordon attacked, aiming to break through Federal lines at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but failed, and the Confederate Army was then surrounded. At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and in it Grant said he would accept the surrender of the Confederate Army under certain conditions. Lee then rode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> hamlet of Appomattox Court House, where the Appomattox county court house stood, and waited for Grant's arrival to surrender his army.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{was born}} in Missouri and trained for {{a career as a}} printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an {{adventure}} in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained in medicine and became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E

The television show ran on ABC Saturday mornings from September 10, 1983 to November 2, 1985 for three seasons and 29 episodes. In 1985, DiC released an animated feature film spun off the series titled Here Come <b>the</b> <b>Littles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Leaving Lebanon, {{the line}} ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the {{highlands}} to Dodds. The never-used grade from Dodds to Waynesville descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Miami River valley via Newman Run before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone abutments for several never-built bridges remain {{on what is}} now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several cuts and fills to traverse the rolling terrain. At Hempstead, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (now the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D, and ended at the Panhandle Route (now the Creekside Trail to the east) at Clement. Part of this line is still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for {{an extension of the}} Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the University of Dayton and alongside the Great Miami River. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL passed over on the first such grade separation in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.|$|E

After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Rock suburbs.

25|$|Two main washes – Moenkopi Wash and Dinnebito Wash - {{pass through}} the mine permit area and {{eventually}} run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Colorado River. Although mining does not occur in these washes, storm water runoff from areas disturbed by mining activities could potentially degrade the quality of water going into them. To prevent degradation of surface waters, sedimentation ponds are constructed under the mine’s surface water protection program. Water quality is monitored and controlled at these ponds, {{as well as at}} livestock watering ponds, seeps and storm water runoff. The program is regulated through the US EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System under NPDES permit No. NN0022179, and Multi-Sector General Permit No. AZR05000I.|$|E
25|$|McIntosh {{had planned}} to envelop Sigel's force from the {{northwest}} while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three miles out of his way, he turned his troopers onto the road leading east <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Sugar Creek valley. By {{the time they reached}} the site where Sigel's northeast road met McIntosh's east-bound road, the Federal general's men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster. When the 3rd Texas Cavalry charged, they ran smack into Sigel's main line. The Confederates lost 10 killed and about 20 wounded to Federal artillery and rifle fire and the Union position held.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} Jesse James became a {{national}} sensation. The Fords {{made no attempt to}} hide their role. Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward. Crowds pressed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> house in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit. The Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities and were dismayed to be charged with first-degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging, and were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden. The governor's quick pardon suggested he knew the brothers intended to kill James rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public and added to James' notoriety.|$|E
25|$|The line {{still exists}} {{as far as}} Springs Road at Prebbleton, the {{overbridge}} having been demolished in the late 1990s. The couple of kilometres still in use serves a number of industries and is shunted when required. Part of the formation near Prebbleton has been incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> River Rail Trail, and a motorway being built just north of Prebbleton will see the line truncated just past the Watties siding, with incorporation of the disused track between the motorway and Marshs Road into the rail trail being proposed.

25|$|Paralleling {{a nearby}} brook, NY242 crosses {{northeast}} {{through a small}} portion of the town of Little Valley, crossing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Valley village a short distance later. Now named Fair Oak Street, NY242 crosses through the county seat into the center of the village. Turning eastward along Fair Oak Street, NY242 becomes a two-lane residential street, reaching an intersection with NY353 (Erie Street). At this junction, NY242 and NY353 become concurrent, turning southeast along Rock City Road, a two-lane residential street. Just west of the junction with Hill Street, the routes turn east and crosses over the Pat McGee Trail (the former Erie Railroad Allegany Division which ran to Dunkirk from Salamanca, and later the New York and Lake Erie Railroad). Just east of the right-of-way, NY242 and NY353 fork in different directions, connected by a junction with CR96 (Kilburne Corners Road).|$|E

25|$|Smyrna {{was located}} {{at the mouth of}} the small river Hermus and at the head of a deep arm of the sea (Smyrnaeus Sinus) that reached far inland. This enabled Greek trading ships to sail into the heart of Lydia, making the city part of an {{essential}} trade route between Anatolia and the Aegean. During the 7th century BC, Smyrna rose to power and splendor. One of the great trade routes which cross Anatolia descends the Hermus valley past Sardis, and then, diverging from the valley, passes south of Mount Sipylus and crosses a low pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> valley where Smyrna lies between the mountains and the sea. Miletus and later Ephesus were situated at the sea end of the other great trade route across Anatolia; they competed for a time successfully with Smyrna; but after both cities' harbors silted up, Smyrna was without a rival.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Durutte {{supervised}} the attack of his 1,700-man 2nd Brigade {{on the extreme}} right. About 1:30 PM, he sent his troops <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> valley in front of Papelotte and La Haye, covered by 18 horse artillery pieces and Jacquinot's cavalry. The original skirmish line recoiled before enemy fire and Durutte quickly reinforced it with battalions in open order. He also sent a horse battery to take Smohain under point-blank fire. Two battalions soon overran Papelotte and victory seemed to be at hand. At this moment, Durutte rode back to the ridge and found to his dismay that the 1st Brigade was crushed and the ground to his left covered with rampaging British cavalry. With the Dutch-Belgian cavalry brigade of Charles Étienne de Ghigny advancing downhill toward them, he had {{the men of the}} 2nd Brigade execute a hasty retreat covered by one of Jacquinot's regiments. The brigade was able to withdraw behind a battalion square from the VI Corps. These troops drove off Ghigny's light horsemen {{with the help of a}} nearby artillery battery.|$|E
25|$|Beaver ponds {{have been}} shown to have a {{beneficial}} effect on trout and salmon populations. Many authors believe that the decline of salmonid fishes is related to the decline in beaver populations. Research in the Stillaguamish River basin in Washington found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. This study also found that beaver ponds increased smolt salmon production 80 times more than the placement of large woody debris. Swales and Leving had previously shown on the Coldwater River in British Columbia that off-channel beaver ponds were preferentially populated by coho salmon over other salmonids and provided overwintering protection, protection from high summer snowmelt flows and summer coho rearing habitat. The presence of beaver dams has also been shown to increase either the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Sagehen Creek, which flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Truckee River at an altitude of 5,800 feet in the northern Sierra Nevada. These findings are consistent with a study of small streams in Sweden, that found that brown trout were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. Similarly, brook trout, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were significantly larger in beaver ponds than those in unimpounded stream sections in Colorado and Alaska. In a recent study on a headwater Appalachian stream, brook trout were also larger in beaver ponds.|$|E
