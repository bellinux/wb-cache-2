5|$|A stone {{building}} {{to the east of}} the main complex <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the abbot's house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{body-centered cubic}} crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution {{measurements of the}} thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery {{in this area is}} expected.|$|E
5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India.

5|$|From this core, {{specifically}} from {{ice that}} <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> formed from lake water freezing onto {{the base of}} the ice sheet, extremophile microbes were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique habitat for ancient bacteria with an isolated microbial gene pool containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
