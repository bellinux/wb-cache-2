5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of <b>dermatological</b> <b>condition</b> and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A <b>dermatological</b> <b>condition</b> known as acral {{mutilation}} and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E

40|$|Skin is {{an organ}} {{that has a}} primary {{function}} in tactile receptivity and reacts directly upon emotional stimuli. Dermatological practice involves a psychosomatic dimension. A relationship between psychological factors and skin diseases has long been hypothesized. Psychodermatology addresses the interaction between mind and skin. It {{is divided into three}} categories according to the relationship between skin diseases and mental disorders. This article reviews different <b>dermatological</b> <b>conditions</b> under each of the three categories namely psychosomatic disorders, <b>dermatological</b> <b>conditions</b> due to primary and secondary psychiatric disorders. <b>Dermatological</b> <b>conditions</b> resulting from psychiatric conditions like stress/depression and those caused by psychiatric disorders are discussed. This review intends to present the relationship between the ‘skin’ and the ‘mind’ specifically from the dermatology point of view. The effects on the quality of life as a result of psychodermatological conditions are highlighted. A multidisciplinary approach for treatment from both dermatologic and psychiatric viewpoints are suggested...|$|R

Method.   A multiple case study was conducted with 10 practice settings across England in which nurses prescribed medicines for patients with <b>dermatological</b> <b>conditions.</b> Data were collected between June 2006 and September 2007 using semi-structured interviews (n = 40), patient questionnaires (n = 165 / 200) and videotaped observations of nurse consultations (n = 40). Data analysis included thematic analysis, descriptive statistics, chi-square and non-parametric tests. Findings.   Nurses believed that their holistic approach to assessment, combined with their prescribing knowledge, improved prescribing decisions. Listening and explanation of treatments were aspects of nurse communication that were rated highly by patients. Listening and dealing sensitively with emotions were also aspects of the videotaped consultations that were rated highly by assessors. Nurses were less consistent in providing information about medicines. Conclusion.   Triangulated data from this study suggest that nurse prescribing enhances the care of patients with <b>dermatological</b> <b>conditions</b> through improved prescribing decisions. If patients are to be more involved in this decision-making, nurses must give them more information about their medicines.
