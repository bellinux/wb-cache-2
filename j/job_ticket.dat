40|$|The print {{production}} workflow consists of various disparate systems — from production equipment to management information systems. During {{the production of}} a printed product, information regarding the product must be communicated between the systems in the workflow. Job Definition Format (JDF) is an industry standard that specifies this information interchange. It specifies a digital <b>job</b> <b>ticket</b> format for exchanging administrative and technical information related to a print job, and a messaging protocol for communicating information between the systems in the workflow. This licentiate thesis explores different aspects of integrating systems in a JDF-enabled print {{production workflow}}. Paper III and Paper IV analyze the properties of JDF’s messaging protocol—Job Messaging Format (JMF) —and discuss design solutions for a JMF integration layer. Paper I presents a software tool for simulating systems in the print production workflow. The tool is based on an open source software library, called the Elk Framework, which has been developed within the framework of these licentiate studies. The Elk Framework provides the base services required by a piece of JDF-enabled production equipment, called a Device/Worker in JDF parlance. Paper II presents a software tool that was developed for testing the simulation tool presented in Paper I. The test tool, named Alces, can be used for testing if JDF-enabled systems conform to the JDF Specification. Report code: LIU-TEK-LIC- 2006 : 66...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the {{effective}} ness of a change in workflow in an order entry department of a forms manufacturing plant. The difference is measured between the original and the revised workflow systems to draw conclusions on a quantitative basis. The original workflow procedure was set up for the <b>job</b> <b>ticket,</b> composed of the paper work and the artwork, to travel together through the first six of nine operations in the order entry department. Then the artwork split from the paper work and was forwarded to the art department, where the mechanical artwork was created, while the paper work continued through operations in the order entry department. The revised system split the artwork from the paper work and forwarded it to the art department after going through three operations, but the paper work continued through all of the order entry department operations. The study revealed that the art department can create the mechanical artwork with adequate instructions, while the paper work of the order continued in the order entry department without disrupting the proudction control system. The revision therefore, created coordination of re-assignment of some responsibilities in order to furnish the art department with its needs. Cutting down on the operations that the artwork had to go through in the order entry department meant that jobs were forwarded to the art department at a faster pace, and through the subsequent departments in the factory without disrupting any of the operations...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the field of large-area, organic and printed {{electronics}} has demonstrated various applications of functional devices. For most of the applications, a reliable supply with electric energy tailored with respect to functional devices and applications is a mandatory, making thin-film battery a challenging area of research. Among a variety of manufacturing concepts printing technologies and their established workflow provide interesting opportunities to fully integrate the battery in a product by customizing its size and shape regarding the device {{to be driven by}} that battery. Hence, these printed electronics applications will contribute a new momentum in the packaging market. Out of the well-known battery concepts for thin-film batteries, the well understood zinc manganese dioxide battery system is very promising due to its simplicity and its environmental sustainability. Therefore it has been chosen to study appropriate fabrication opportunities based on printing technologies. In this paper, we report on the development of a process workflow and, the setup of a pilot manufacturing line, taking into account the requirements to adapt the energy content, the size and the shape to the powered product. The overall manufacturing procedure is divided into single process steps, following the traditional printing workflow which is used in the printing and media industries consisting of Prepress, Press and Post Press. The paper maps the advantages of an automated production process and covers the introduction of process documentation, aspects of quality control, cost minimization and the efficiency improvement. A basic concept for an adapted digital workflow comprising the definition of relevant metadata and <b>job</b> <b>ticket</b> content, which is required for further industrial fabrication of thin film batteries, will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Geant 4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) is a {{commonly}} used platform developed for nuclear medicine imaging simulation. It {{has been used}} to investigate imaging system’s sensitivity, data acquisition methods, or image reconstruction algorithms. The GATE system, based on the Monte Carlo method, operates relying on user-provided scripts that follow the program definitions in the system’s command library. Script-writing is usually time-consuming and frequently error-associated unless one has had certain experience in the simulation field and is familiar with programming. This is obviously an obstacle to students and beginners. The learning curve of script-writing is relatively flat to non-programming background learners. In addition, the GATE system is commonly installed on a high-performance computer, on which the scripts are usually compiled and used by the user only. In order to utilize GATE’s potential to be a routine simulation toolkit, we have developed QGATE, a GUI-based GATE system. The QGATE system provides users a graphi-cal environment where a simulation design is achieved by fashions like “drag-and-drop objects ” and “choose-and-modify parameters”. The scripts will be automatically generated and complied by the system. Parameters belonging to each object have default values so as to avoid errors induced by new users. The QGATE system consists of one or more QGATE Cli-ents and one QGATE Server. The Client can be installed on individual computers so that multiple users can work on their simulation projects simultaneously by using the graphical designing tools. The Server is installed on the same computer as the GATE system resides. The Server manages the submitted simulation scripts queued by a <b>job</b> <b>ticket</b> and returns the job finish signal to the corresponding client. The QGATE system is suitable for classroom training and easy to use for stu-dents or new users to the field of nuclear medicine imaging simulation...|$|E
