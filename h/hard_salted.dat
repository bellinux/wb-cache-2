50|$|Shards {{of pottery}} pierced with holes found in pile-dwellings are {{hypothesized}} to be cheese-strainers. They {{are of the}} Urnfield culture on Lake Neuchatel and date back to 6,000 BC. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates back to 5,500 BC in Kujawy, Poland. For preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk. Curdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds, leading to the addition of rennet. Dairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara. <b>Hard</b> <b>salted</b> cheese {{is likely to have}} accompanied dairying from the outset. It is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate. Animal skins and inflated internal organs provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Dead Sea (DS) {{coastal areas}} have been {{dramatically}} hit by sinkhole occurrences since around 1990. It {{has been shown that}} the sinkholes along both Israeli and Jordanian shorelines are linked to evaporate karst cavities that are formed by slow salt dissolution. Both the timing and location of sinkholes suggest that: 1) the salt weakens as the result of unsaturated water circulation, thus enhancing the karstification process; and 2) sinkholes appear {{to be related to the}} decompaction of the sediments above karstified zones. The location, depth, thickness and weakening of salt layers along the DS shorelines, as well as the thickness and mechanical properties of the upper sedimentary deposits, are thus considered as controlling factors of this on-going process. The knowledge of shear-wave velocities (Vs) should add valuable insights on mechanical properties of both the salt and its overburden. We have suggested Vs estimation using surface-wave prospecting methods, based on surface-wave dispersion measurements and inversion. Two approaches have been used. Along the Israeli shoreline, Vs mapping has been performed to discriminate weak and <b>hard</b> zones within <b>salt</b> layers, after calibration of inverted Vs near boreholes. It has been shown that there is a Vs increase in the DS direction. Initially examined weak zones, located near the salt edge, associated with karstified salt, are characterized by Vs values of 760 – 1, 050 m/s, and extend 60 – 100 m from the salt edge in the DS direction. <b>Hard</b> <b>salt</b> zones with velocity Vs values greater than 1, 500 m/s are located at distances of more than 100 – 220 m from the salt edge. Finally, transition zones (1, 050 < Vs < 1, 500 m/s) have a 40 – 160 m spread. On a Jordanian site, roll-along acquisition and dispersion stacking has been performed to achieve multi-modal dispersion measurements along linear profiles. Inverted pseudo- 2 -D Vs sections present low Vs anomalies in the vicinity of existing sinkholes and made it possible to detect decompacted sediments associated with potential sinkhole occurrences. Moreover, Vs profiles showed a high velocity unit at 40 – 50 m depth that can be interpreted as a salt layer...|$|R

40|$|Picante da Beira Baixa (or Picante) {{cheese is}} a <b>hard,</b> piquant, <b>salted</b> {{traditional}} cheese manufactured in Portugal from raw sheep’s and goat’s milks. The {{purpose of this}} work was to quantitatively assess the influence of various ripening procedures on the final characteristics of Picante cheese. Two alternative ripening protocols were considered, the traditional one and another with controlled environmental conditions via use of maturation chambers set at different preselected temperatures. The experimental cheeses were characterised in terms of microbiological, physicochemical, biochemical, sensorial and textural properties. Ripening time and temperature were statistically significant parameters for all microflora. The two ripening methods led to statistically significant differences in all physicochemical and biochemical parameters, especially the moisture content and the soluble nitrogen fractions (i. e. water loss was slower and proteolysis was faster in cheeses ripened via the traditional method). Differences in microbiological, physicochemical and biochemical properties were probables implicated in differences in textural and sensorial properties, especially cheese hardness and flavour.

Increased dental diseases associated with climatic and geographical characteristics of the area are widely discussed in the literature. The leading among them are environmentally determined dental diseases in children associated with geochemical and technogenic pollution of the area where they live. Increasing amounts of <b>hard</b> metal <b>salts</b> is the urgent hygienic problem, due to severity of their multi-element analysis in microsubjects, and negative influence on health of the children population, due to tropism, ability to cumulation, long biological life {{in the body and}} antagonism of heavy metal salts to the number of microelements. Influence of <b>hard</b> metal <b>salts</b> on dental diseases development is undeniable. Particular attention is paid to their influence on caries process and treatment peculiarities. Despite the fact that modern аdhesive dentistry in recent years has made a significant breakthrough in improving adhesive systems, correct choice of adhesive system depending on changes in the structure of hard tissue under geochemical contaminants (like heavy metal salts) is the most important step. It is the decisive factor for adaptation and connection of restoration with the restoration base. We should remember that on the way of adhesive system there is an altered structure preventing from deep penetration of such system and, consequently, leading to violation of restoration tightness. Therefore, early detection of complications by clinical evaluation of quality of the restorations is of great interest. Multi-vector approach to treatment of dental caries in children living in conditions of technogenic pollution by heavy metal salts is extremely urgent and important issue. Significant niche in this approach is given to adhesive preparation methods combined with local fluoridation, using fluoride medication of the new generation. One of them is Hluftored which promotes the formation of microcrystalline СаF 2. Protocol of work with this new generation drug is based on the sequential precoating of enamel with magnesium-fluoride silicate, and then with suspension of high desperasible calcium hydroxide promoting formation of microcrystalline СаF 2, magnesium and copper with the size of ~ 50 Аº, leading to easy penetration of fluoride into pores of softening range. Moreover, microcrystals of CaF 2 are protected by silicic acid gel from outwashing. Therefore, they release fluoride {{for a long period of}} time (over 1 year), which promotes remineralization and prevents complications of dental caries. This article includes the data regarding effectiveness of the Hluftored use in combination with various adhesive systems. Also, we show data of clinical quality assessment conducted for restoration procedures in children of different age groups and territories by using index of USPHS, after 6 and 18 months of carrying out such procedures.

40|$|A new approach, {{based on}} a {{combination}} of <b>salt</b> and <b>hard</b> templating for producing multi-modal porous carbons is demonstrated. The hard template, silica nanoparticles, generate mesopores (∼ 22 nm), and in some cases borderline-macropores (∼ 64 nm), resulting in high pore volume (∼ 3. 9 cm 3 /g) while the salt template, zinc chloride, generates borderline-mesopores (∼ 2 nm), thus imparting high surface area (∼ 2100 m 2 /g). The versatility of the proposed synthesis technique is demonstrated using: (i) dual <b>salt</b> templates with <b>hard</b> template resulting in magnetic, nanostructured-clay embedded (∼ 27 % clay content), high surface area (∼ 1527 m 2 /g) bimodal carbons (∼ 2 and 70 nm pores), (ii) multiple <b>hard</b> templates with <b>salt</b> template resulting in tri-modal carbons (∼ 2, 12 and 28 nm pores), (iii) low temperature (450 °C) synthesis of bimodal carbons afforded by the presence of hygroscopic salt template, (iv) easy coupling with physical activation approaches. A selected set of thus synthesized carbons were used to evaluate, for the first time, the simultaneous effects of carbon porosity and pressure applied during electrode fabrication on EDLC performance.
