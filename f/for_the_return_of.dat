5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II.

In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954.
