Then, consumers can only obtain “thin slices” {{of information from}} the ads, such as which product and brand are being promoted. This research {{is the first to}} examine the influence that such thin slices of information have on ad and brand evaluation. Two lab experiments and one large field experiment, with <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> ranging from very brief (100 msec.) to very long (30 seconds), provide support for the hypothesis that advertising evaluation critically depends on the <b>duration</b> of ad <b>exposure</b> and on how ads convey which product and brand they promote, but in unexpected ways. Our experiments show that upfront ads, which instantly convey what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief but also after longer <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> Mystery ads, which suspend conveying what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively after longer <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> False front ads, which initially convey another identity than what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief exposures but negatively after longer <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> Bayesian mediation analysis demonstrates that the sheer “feeling of knowing what the ad promotes” accounts for these ad-type effects on evaluation. The findings demonstrate the importance of thin slices of information in ad and brand evaluation, and have implications for advertising research and management.

The aim of our research is to test previous reconstructions of glacial history and to begin to address the paucity of chronological control for the lateral and vertical extent of the northern CIS. Chronological evidence for CIS expansion predating the Last Glacial Maximum comes from minimum surface <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> of c 100  ka for two bedrock samples within the Reid glacial limit, indicating a possible marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 6 age for this event, and from minimum <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> of about 40  ka for boulders on moraines constructed by alpine glaciers on a nunatak within the McConnell glacial limit (OIS 2), indicating a possible OIS 4 age. High elevation minimum surface <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> within the McConnell limit indicate that some areas formerly mapped as nunataks were covered by cold-based ice prior to 30  ka. Montane glaciation in the Mackenzie Mountains, outside the McConnell glacial limit, was contemporaneous with nearby CIS advance at 17  ka, with CIS retreat by 15  ka.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{can be used in}} conjunction with existing display technologies as a means for achieving ultra-rapid visual stimulus <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> We review existing rapid visual display methods, and show how our apparatus overcomes the limitations inherent with each technique. Our apparatus, the LED tachistoscope, takes advantage of the fast-switching times and high-brightness capabilities of LEDs in order to present sti muli at previously unachievable durations as rapid as 1 ms. The rapid <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> are achieved by external LED backlight illumination of images on a liquid crystal display (LCD) after the components of the LCD have stabilized. This ensures that stimulus onset and offset are discrete. Furthermore, the fast-switching of the LEDs enables stimuli to be revealed for very rapid durations. The paper also describes studies in which the LED tachistoscope has already been applied, and offers suggestions for other possible applications. Interestingly, in our studies we show that the human visual system is very adept at extracting information with only very minimal stimulus <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> Such studies have not been possible with existing display equipment. The LED tachistoscope opens up avenues for a variety of psychological and physiological experiments and provides a means for revealing the limits of human visual perception. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to pursue the research on the affective primacy hypothesis, which claims that positive and negative affective reactions can be evoked with minimal stimulus input and virtually no cognitive processing (Zajonc, 1980). In line with Murphy and Zajonc (1993) a priming paradigm was used. The present work is basically a replication of their study in which the effects of affective priming under very brief (suboptimal - 4 ms) and longer (optimal - 1000 ms) <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> were compared, but using two additional exposure durations: 30 ms and 100 ms. Like Murphy and Zajonc, facial expressions were used as affective primes in addition to pictures which portrayed scenes and situations of everyday life. These were obtained in a preliminary study. Contrary to Murphy and Zajonc's results, the affective primes only produced significant shifts in subjects' preferential judgements of novel stimuli at longer <b>exposure</b> <b>durations.</b> At suboptimal <b>exposures</b> the novel stimuli were not judged differentially when primed with positive or negative affect. This was true for both facial expressions and pictures. Facial expressions influenced the liking ratings of the ideographs only at <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> of 30 ms and longer; pictures not until they were exposed for at least 100 ms. Thus, pictures depicting daily events require longer <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> than facial expressions in order to elicit an affective reaction. These results however do not provide any clear-cut evidence in support of the affective primacy hypothesis. Instead, they seem to suggest that affective stimuli do not evoke an affective reaction without additional cognitive processing, a conclusion that is supported by LeDoux’s theory of affective-cognitive interaction in the brain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. Polyembryonic wasps provide {{dramatic}} {{examples of}} intra-specific developmental conflict. In these parasitoids, each egg proliferates into a clonal lineage of genetically identical larvae. If {{more than one}} egg is laid in a host (superparasitism), individuals of different clones may compete for food resources. 2. In the polyembryonic encyrtid Copidosoma koehleri, one larva per clone can differentiate into a sterile soldier. It is shown that soldiers are always females, and that they attack intra-specific competitors. 3. Research hypotheses were that (a) clones that develop in superparasitised hosts suffer heavier mortality than clones that develop in singly parasitised hosts, and (b) female clones cause higher mortality to their competitors than male clones, hence larval survival is lower in superparasitised hosts that contain females than in male-only broods. 4.

In keeping with recent theoretical proposals, our findings demonstrate that heightened ruminative disposition is associated only with impaired attentional disengagement from depressogenic information, and does not involve facilitated attentional engagement with such information. In addition to resolving this key issue, the present study provided converging support for the previous claim that rumination-linked attentional bias is specific to depressogenic information, and also lends weight to the contention that rumination-linked attentional bias may be evident only when controlled attentional processing is readily permitted by using stimulus <b>exposure</b> <b>durations</b> of 1, 000 ms.
