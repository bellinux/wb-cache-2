A nontrivial size distribution of banks arises out of regional segmentation and endogenous entry and exit. The model is calibrated to match a set of key aggregate and cross-sectional statistics for the U. S. banking industry. We test the model against business cycle moments, salient characteristics of the commercial bank distribution and the empirical regularities linking banking crisis, <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> and concentration. As in the data, the model generates countercyclical loan interest rates, bank failure rates, <b>default</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and markups as well as procyclical loan supply and entry rates. The model also generates the observed negative relation between loan return rates, variance of returns and net interest margins with bank size. We find that the model is consistent with the empirical literature in generating a negative relation between banking crisis and concentration as well as a positive relation between <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> and concentration.

40|$|We {{examine the}} default probabilities {{predicted}} by “structural ” models of risky corporate debt. Two types of models are examined: those with “exogenous ” default boundaries, typified by Longstaff and Schwartz (1995); {{and those with}} “endogenous ” default boundaries, typified by Leland and Toft (1996). We focus on default probabilities rather than credit spreads because (i) they are not affected by additional factors such as liquidity, tax differences, and recovery rates; and (ii) prediction of the relative likelihood of default is often stated as the objective of bond ratings. We examine the ability of these models to capture the actual average <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> across bonds with different ratings reported in Moody’s (2001) corporate bond default data, 1970 - 2000. When default costs and recovery rates are matched, exogenous and endogenous default boundary models fit observed <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> equally well. The models predict longer-term <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> quite accurately, both for investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. Shorter-term <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> tend to be underestimated, suggesting that a jump component {{should be included in}} asset value dynamics.

First, on the substantive side, using Argentina as a test case we show that unlike one-period debt models, our model of long-term sovereign debt is capable of accounting for the average spread, the average <b>default</b> <b>frequency,</b> and the average debt-tooutput ratio of Argentina over the 1991 - 2001 period without any deterioration in the model’s ability to account for Argentina’s cyclical facts. Using our calibrated model we determine what Argentina’s debt, <b>default</b> <b>frequency</b> and welfare {{would have been if}} Argentina had issued only short-term debt. Second, on the methodological side, we advance the theory of sovereign debt begun in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) by establishing the existence of an equilibrium pricing function for long-term sovereign debt and by providing a fairly complete set of characterization results regarding equilibrium default and borrowing behavior. In addition, we identify and solve a computational problem associated with pricing long-term unsecured debt that stems from nonconvexities introduced by the possibility of default.

40|$|This Paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of dynamic capital structure adjustments on credit risk. Firms may optimally adjust their leverage in response to stochastic changes in firm value. It is shown that capital structure dynamics lower optimal initial leverage ratios but increase both fair credit spreads and expected default probabilities for moderate levels of transactions costs. Numerical examples demonstrate that expected <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> do not decrease monotonically in the traditional distance to default measure. The magnitude of {{the effect of}} capital structure dynamics depends on firm characteristics such as asset volatility, the growth rate, the effective corporate tax rate, debt call features and transactions costs. We find that the underestimation of credit spreads and expected <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> is exacerbated when the risk-adjusted drift of the underlying stochastic process is inferred from a model which ignores the opportunity to recapitalize. Finally it is shown that the Value-at-Risk of corporate bonds increases with the distance to default (DD) both for very low and for very high values of DD whereas it decreases for intermediate values. capital structure; credit risk...|$|R

This study measured default DP-gram protocols and user-defined DP spectrum protocols in 35 normal hearing young adults using Otodynamics ILO 96 equipment. Very short-term and short-term reliability was assessed, with measures conducted 20 minutes, and an average of 15 days later, respectively. The test resolution setting for the DP-gram measurements was varied between 1 to 8 points per octave in each test series. DPOAE amplitudes in the <b>default</b> <b>frequency</b> range (1 to 6 kHz) between test and short-term retest were highly correlated, with average r = 0. 81. Standard error of measurement (SEM) was found to average 2. 64 dB for DPOAE amplitude in the <b>default</b> <b>frequency</b> range. DPOAE amplitudes in the higher frequency range of 6. 5 to 7 kHz were also significantly correlated between test and short-term retest; r ranged from 0. 80 to 0. 82 and SEM ranged from 2. 59 to 3. 04 dB.

40|$|In {{the turmoil}} of 2007 - 2009, {{troubles}} in a small segment of the US mortgage market escalated into a crisis of global proportions. A striking feature of the crisis is the contagion that hit Asia. In a region where direct exposures to problem mortgages were minimal, credit spreads for major borrowers widened even {{more than they did}} in Europe and the United States. We argue that the contagion was part of an amplification mechanism driven by valuation losses caused by the bursting of a global credit bubble. The valuation losses stemmed not so much from a reassessment of credit risks as from a global repricing of these risks. It was this repricing that was the main channel for contagion into Asian credit (and equity) markets. For empirical evidence, we analyze fluctuations in credit default swap (CDS) spreads and expected <b>default</b> <b>frequencies</b> (EDFs) for major Asian borrowers. We find that valuation losses on CDS contracts for these Asian borrowers arose in part from movements in global and region-specific risk pricing factors as well as from revisions to expected losses from defaults.

We aimed to explore this mismatch, correlate it to performance, and finally to discuss its possible clinical consequences. Ten patients with SSD and a CI (Cochlear Ltd.) compared the pitch of electrical and acoustic stimuli. Patients had to choose one of two acoustic stimuli, with the pitch closest to the pitch of the electrical stimulus at electrodes 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19. The {{difference between the two}} acoustic stimuli iteratively decreased from 2 octaves to 1 / 8 octave, resulting in a "pitch match" per electrode. Furthermore, we computed the insertion angle of the CI electrode array based on high-resolution computed-tomography scans. Subsequently, we created frequency-place maps.
