6000|$|Arising {{early next}} morning, I was assured {{that it is}} {{necessary}} to cross the stream in order to reach the Cataracts. Tuckey did so, but further inquiry convinced me that it is a mistake to march along the northern bank. Of course, in skirting the southern side, we should not have approached so near the stream, where bluffs and débris rendered travelling hopeless. The amiable ichthyophagi agreed for two fathoms of <b>fancy</b> <b>cloth</b> to ferry us across the river, which is here half a mile broad. The six-knot current compels canoes to run up the left shore by means of its backwater, and, when crossing, to make allowance for the drift downwards. The aneroid now showed 860 feet of absolute altitude, and about sixty-five feet above the landing-place of Banza Nokki; the distance along the stream is fourteen miles, and thus the fall will be about five feet per mile below the Borongwa ya Vivi. We could see from a level the [...] "smaller rapids of Vivi" [...] bursting through their black gate with angry foam, flashing white from side to side. No canoe could shoot this [...] "Cachoeira," [...] but I do not think that a Nile Dahabiyah or a Brazilian Ajôjô would find great difficulty. Between us and the rapids, the concavity of the southern bank forms a bight or bay. The vortices, in which Tuckey's sloop was whirled round despite oars and sails, and in whose hollow the punt entirely disappeared, [...] "so that the depression must have been three or four feet deep," [...] were nowhere seen at this fuller season. The aspect of the surface is that of every large deep stream with broken bottom; the water boils up in ever widening domes, as though a system of fountains sprang from below. Each centre is apparently higher than its circle; it spreads as if a rock had been thrown into it, and the outer rim throws off little eddies and whirls no larger than a thimble. The mirrory surface of the lower river thus becomes mottled with light and shade, and the reflected image of the trough-cliff is broken into the most fantastic shapes.|$|E

The firm then developed the manufacture of <b>fancy</b> <b>cloths,</b> using steam-powered looms in place of hand looms, and acquired mills at Bolton and Newton Heath for their manufacture. In the 1860s, Henry Tootal Broadhurst, Henry and Joseph Lee, and Robert Scott, were business partners who formed a limited company, Tootal Broadhurst Lee, marketing their goods under the name Tootal.|$|R

Gidi Mavunga would not even break his fast before touching the cloth and beads, which are to pay for guidance and carriage. The hut-door was closed, and {{in half an hour}} all was settled to every one's satisfaction. Yet the veteran did not disdain a little rascality. Awaiting his opportunity, he tossed into a dark corner a little bundle of two <b>fancy</b> <b>cloths</b> which I had given the [...] "linguistero" [...] and, when detected, he shamelessly declared that such people have no right to trade.|$|R

40|$|For years {{archaeologists have}} {{commented on the}} {{occurrence}} of typically Aegean patterns on the ceilings of {{a fair number of}} Egyptian tombs, while musing that they could not see how such patterns were reaching Egypt. Certainly Minoan and Mycenaean potsherds had been found in fair numbers in Egypt; but the designs on the Egyptian ceilings were not the ones used by Aegean potters. To me, however, the particular patterns and layouts seemed strongly reminiscent of weaving —a craft I was quite familiar with, unlike most archaeologists, because my mother was a weaver. If the source of these ceiling patterns were indeed pieces of imported cloth, it would explain why the archaeologists could see no mode of transport, since the cloth itself has not survived. Indeed not a scrap of patterned textile has survived in the Aegean area from the Bronze Age: Greece {{is one of the worst}} places in all of Europe and the Mediterranean for the preservation of textiles. So what do we have to go on? For one thing, we can examine what they show themselves as wearing. And what gorgeous textiles they are! In fresco after fresco we see handsome all-over polychrome patterns, the favorite being interlocked shapes like trefoils and quatrefoils. On the one hand, most archaeologists have assumed, if they thought about it at all, that the scrumptious fabric designs in these frescoes were far beyond the weavers of the day, and hence that the Bronze Age fresco painters had invented the designs to make their pictures look pretty. And of course no such cloth has survived to prove the case either way, because no cloth has survived at all from Minoan Crete. We have, however, an independent source of evidence about what people were capable of weaving—namely, the more general history of European weaving—and it tells us that Europeans of lesser cultures nearby had already been weaving <b>fancy</b> <b>cloth</b> for millennia. We know from various sorts of archaeological and palaeobotanical evidence, for example, that flax had been in use for textiles throughout southeastern Europe since the 6 th millennium BC, and that wool and woolly sheep had been introduced from the Near East shortly before 3000 BC (the end of the Neolithic). At about this time we are lucky enough to get some fragments of patterned cloth from various other parts of central and southern Europe—from the Swiss pile dwellings, the Megalithic passage graves of East Germany, and the pile dwellings of northern Italy. Most of these textiles are patterned with supplemental wefts: one splendid example is the famous Neolithic linen 2 ̆ 2 brocade 2 ̆ 2 from Irgenhausen, in Switzerland, which analysis shows must have been executed in a minimum of 3 colors, possibly more...|$|E

5000|$|The rancho {{society had}} few {{resources}} except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and {{cutting off the}} fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to <b>fancy</b> thread and <b>cloth</b> that could be sewn into fancy cloaks or ladies' dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from Boston, Massachusetts, Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The trip from Boston, New York City or Liverpool England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into San Diego, San Juan Capistrano, San Pedro, San Buenaventura (Ventura), Monterey and Yerba Buena (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the import tariff of 50-100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. gives a good first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were {{used to make a}} large number of items during this period.

40|$|Some {{time ago}} I {{embarked}} on a 2 ̆ 2 short little project 2 ̆ 2 {{to find out what}} I could about Bronze Age Aegean textiles, which I had come to suspect were more elaborate and more important than anyone was giving them credit for. I knew the project could not take very long, and would not take more than maybe ten pages to write up, because virtually nothing in the way of textiles has survived from Greece—even in the Classical period, let alone the prehistoric era. But my father, who was a physicist, had instilled into me a question that changed everything: namely, 2 ̆ 2 (If I can 2 ̆ 7 t get at it by the direct route,) how else can I get at it? 2 ̆ 2 Fourteen years and 800 pages of 2 ̆ 2 how elses 2 ̆ 2 later, I had more or less wrapped up my 2 ̆ 2 little project 2 ̆ 2 —soon to be published as a fat book. It is the story of what strategies and methods I had to invent or discover, to squeeze out the answers to my original questions, that I have been asked to talk about here. My project had begun when I noticed a) that some typically Aegean artistic motifs were turning up in Bronze Age Egypt without visible means of transport across the Mediterranean— patterns that looked to me like textile patterns; and b) that the earliest archaic Greek art had sprung up with some clear Mycenaean traits, but with no visible means of transport across more than 400 years. These traits, too, looked to me as if they had their origins in textiles. Archaeologists and art historians, however, pooh-poohed the idea of <b>fancy</b> <b>cloth.</b> After all, people then could not have known how to make such fancy fabrics: we all know that the Greeks were used to wearing plain 2 ̆ 2 classical 2 ̆ 2 white; that they had just climbed out of a cave, sartorially speaking—like Herakles, running about in nothing but a lion-skin—; in fact, that they barely knew how to weave! So my problem was, could I back up my case? After all, virtually no textiles had survived, and indeed, Greece is one of the very worst places for the survival of ancient textiles, because the climate alternates between very dry and very wet each year. Most people who work with the history of textiles are used to looking at reasonably large pieces of cloth. But the prehistorian is lucky to get scraps the size of your thumbnail. The reaction of most scholars to such crummy little artifacts is either to toss them on the dump heap, or barely to mention them in a footnote, thinking that there is no information value in such scraps. And as long as you only look at one or two of them, that 2 ̆ 7 s true. I found, however, that the information value of these tidbits increases almost endlessly as you widen the context. It is rather like looking at a pointilliste painting by Van Gogh: if you get up very close, all you see is dots—lots of little dots that don 2 ̆ 7 t mean anything. But as you move farther away and get a broader view, you begin to see meaningful patterns in them. In just this way I learned I had to increase the context—increase it geographically, in time span, and in the scope of the questions...|$|E
5000|$|Monaghan Mill {{was founded}} by Lewis Wardlaw Parker (1865-1916) and his cousin, Thomas Fleming Parker (1860-1926). Lewis Parker was born in Abbeville, South Carolina, and {{graduated}} from the College of South Carolina in 1885, and from its law school two years later. After teaching in Columbia, he practiced law in Greenville and there {{became president of the}} Bank of Greer. Thomas Fleming Parker was born in Charleston and attended the College of Charleston before moving to Greenville, where his father held shares in a group of cotton mills. Because the Bank of Greer was the receiver for the Victor Manufacturing Company, in 1897, Lewis Parker reorganized it as well as the Whaley Mills of Columbia. In February 1900, Parker and his cousin Thomas organized Monaghan Mill and named it for County Monaghan, the birthplace of their grandfather Thomas Fleming. The Rhode Island firm of Lockwood, Greene & Co. built the mill, which opened in 1902 on 325 acres {{on the west side of}} Greenville near the Reedy River. The mill was capitalized at $450,000 and had 35,000 spindles. [...] Monaghan was successful from the beginning, producing “print <b>cloths,</b> <b>fancy</b> dress goods and shirtings,” and “shade cloth.” By 1907, Monaghan had increased its spindles to 60,000 and the capital in stock alone had increased to $700,000. The surge in textile manufacturing drew workers from other states and Europe to Greenville. For instance, Monaghan employed fifty Belgian immigrants, who lived at one of the mill’s boarding houses. In 1911, the Parker cousins merged the Victor and Whaley Mills, which they already owned, with the Olympia, Richland, Granby, and Capital City Mills of Columbia, and the Appalache Mills of Greer, to form the Parker Cotton Mills Company, which was capitalized at $15 million and operated over a million spindles, more than any other contemporary U.S. textile firm. The company collapsed in 1914 because of a lack of capital during a cotton panic that occurred at the outbreak of World War I. Lewis resigned the presidency of the company and practiced law until his death from cancer in 1916. Thomas eventually retired. The first successful cotton mill merger did not occur for another twenty years. In 1917, the former Parker mills were reorganized into the Victor-Monaghan Group, and were sold in 1946 to J. P. Stevens and Company.|$|R
