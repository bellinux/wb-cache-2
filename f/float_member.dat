40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} lumped parameter {{model of}} planetary gears is presented which accounts for planet position errors and simulates their contribution to the quasi-static and dynamic load sharing amongst the planets. A unique feature of the model is that instantaneous gear geometry is used which depends on the combination of deflections and errors. The numerical results compare well with experimental evidence from the literature thus validating the modelling methodology. Simulations are then extended to dynamic tooth loads and trajectories for both fixed and rotating carriers. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of <b>floating</b> <b>members</b> in high-speed planetary gears are illustrated and commented upon...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEccentricity {{errors are}} {{incorporated}} into a planetary gear lumped parameter model in which deflections, errors and gear geometry are coupled. In the presence of errors, rigid-body positions and motions are perturbed leading to initial separations between tooth flanks and inertial excitations caused by unsteady rotational speeds. The equations of motion are solved by combining a time-step scheme, a contact algorithm and a fixed-point method, which {{make it possible to}} determine and use mesh instantaneous characteristics in the calculations of tooth loads. A number of quasi-static and dynamic results are presented which show that eccentricities can be highly influential on planetary gear dynamic behaviour. Finally, the interest of <b>floating</b> <b>members</b> in equalizing planet dynamic loading is demonstrated and commented upon...|$|R

Another song from the album, [...] "Maybe He'll Know," [...] was rerecorded by Lauper on her second solo album, True Colors, in 1986.|$|R
50|$|Slides can be {{constructed}} with two sections or multiple sections. A slide with two sections can only extend approximately 3/4 of the total compressed slide length. A compound slide typically has three sections: fixed, <b>floating</b> intermediate <b>member,</b> and the section attached to the equipment. A compound slide can extend {{at least as far}} as the compressed slide length and typically a bit more. In the case of rack slides, this allows the equipment to extend completely out of the rack allowing access for service or connection of cables and such to the back of the equipment.|$|R

50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a <b>floating</b> <b>member</b> hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|R

50|$|In mid-2012, a {{proposal}} was <b>floated</b> by <b>members</b> of the editing community to fork their work at Wikitravel (forking {{in this context}} means to move editing activities and current content to a new host, {{in accordance with the}} site license) and re-merge with the travel website Wikivoyage—which had been a fork of German and Italian language Wikitravel some years before—and to then seek hosting of the merged sites by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Internet Brands opposed this move and sued one Wikitravel contributor and one Wikipedia contributor, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition and civil conspiracy. This move was opposed by individuals and by the Wikimedia Foundation as being an example of a SLAPP lawsuit—one undertaken without plausible legal grounds with a primary intent being to deter, overwhelm, or frustrate persons engaged in fully lawful actions.|$|R
50|$|Nagar Kirtan (ਨਗਰ ਕੀਰਤਨ) is a Sikh custom {{involving}} the processional singing of holy hymns throughout a community. While practiced at any time, it is customary {{in the month}} of Visakhi (or Vaisakhi). Traditionally, the procession is led by the saffron-robed Panj Piare (the five beloved of the Guru), who are followed by the Guru Granth Sahib, and the holy Sikh scripture—which is placed on a <b>float.</b> Commonly, <b>members</b> of the procession are unshod in deference to the displayed scripture. Likewise, many cover their heads and don the colour saffron or orange. The road before the procession is cleared by Sewadars. Bystanders bow their heads to the scripture. Food may be provided to them from floats that follow the Scripture or from stationary points near the vicinity of the procession. The procession concludes at the Gurudwara with Ardas (pray).|$|R
5000|$|Smith did {{not intend}} to become the lead vocalist of the group. Bowler and Dray note that the Obelisk had [...] "featured Dempsey and Ceccagno as guitarists and him Robert on piano as very much a {{background}} player." [...] As [...] "the group" [...] gradually became Malice and began regular rehearsals in January 1976, Smith was still one of several <b>floating</b> <b>members.</b> Of their first [...] "proper" [...] rehearsal at St Edwards Church, Robert said [...] I think it all came about because Marc Ceccagno wanted to be a guitar hero. Michael had a bass, I had got hold of a guitar and our first drummer, Graham, had a drum kit. His brother had an amp and a mic, so he sang. [...] By December 1976, Graham's brother had been replaced by vocalist Martin Creasy, a journalist with The Crawley Observer, whose brief tenure with the group was a live débâcle according to those involved. By January 1977 Malice had changed their name to Easy Cure, partly to distance themselves from these earlier shows. Both drummer Lol Tolhurst and bassist Mick Dempsey are also noted as having performed vocals with the group in the early years. Tolhurst also sang on a cover of [...] "Wild Thing" [...] at Malice's early shows, and Dempsey sang backing vocals on songs like [...] "Killing An Arab", and even recorded lead vocals on one track on the Cure's debut album, for their cover of Hendrix's [...] "Foxy Lady". During March 1977, a vocalist named Gary X came and went, and was replaced by Peter O'Toole, described as [...] "a demon footballer and Bowie fan" [...] who made his singing debut in April. O'Toole remained Easy Cure's steady front man for several months while the group played the local pub circuit, [...] "building up an enormous local following", and was even the singer on the home demo tapes that landed them their first recording contract with Hansa Records.|$|R

Following the hatch opening, the crew <b>members</b> <b>floated</b> aboard the ISS to greet the already-aboard Dan Burbank, Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoli Ivanishin. Together, the two crews formed the full group of Expedition 30 until March 2012.|$|R
50|$|Many floats, {{along with}} their drive train, include {{computer-controlled}} robotic mechanisms to animate the floats. Most float drivers can only see the ground below them. An observer communicates by intercom to the driver. Most observers are hidden within the float and have limited visibility. Each float has a Tournament <b>Member</b> (<b>Float</b> Liaison) assigned to it who shepherds the float from the float barn to the formation area and down the parade route. Most ride on motor scooters although some walk. The Float Liaisons communicate with the float's observer by hand signals.

5000|$|With {{less than}} 15 {{minutes to go}} until launch, the RX-M's crew {{are still in the}} midst of a leisurely press conference being held at a base building. From its launch pad, the RX-M blasts {{straight}} up, and once it leaves the Earth's atmosphere, the ship makes a hard 90-degree turn to place the RX-M into Earth orbit. Its speed at an altitude of 360 miles is stated to be 3400 mph; in fact at that height orbital velocity is 18783 mph (though escape velocity is approximately correctly stated to be 25000 mph). Simultaneously with that turn, the crew cabin rotates within the RX-M's hull, around its lateral axis, so the ship's cabin deck is always facing [...] "down", orienting the audience.
