He first asked Williams-Wynn {{whether there was a}} suitable local man for the appointment and he was told there was not. His next concern was whether his wife and infant daughter should be exposed to the rigours of the Indian climate, and also if his own health was adequate. After consultation with doctors and discussion with his family, Heber wrote to Williams-Wynn on 2 January 1823, refusing the post. Within days he had written again, regretting the refusal and asking [...] if the post was still available, at which Williams-Wynn quickly obtained the formal approval of King George IV to the appointment. Heber spent the next few months at Hodnet preparing for his departure; during this period he gave a farewell sermon at Oxford, after which the degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) was conferred on him. On 1 June 1823 Heber was formally consecrated as Bishop of Calcutta at Lambeth Palace, by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Two weeks later he departed for India with Amelia and his daughter Emily.|$|E

40|$|Sentences {{that begin}} with Why don’t you （I, we） or Why not are {{primarily}} interrogatives, and they normally take question marks. A {{large number of}} these instances are used with question marks, {{but some of them}} are not.

The instances without question marks can also <b>imply</b> suggestions, <b>offers</b> or requests.

The proposed reverse-engineered DCF model is operable by individual investors, {{as it does}} not require access to private information or sell-side analysts’ forecasts Applying the procedure to a sample of IPOs in three European countries (France, Italy, and Germany), we estimate the cash flow growth <b>implied</b> by <b>offer</b> prices and examine the bias of implied growth in comparison to the realized. We find that the estimated growth in cash flow is much higher than its actual realization, with the median IPO firm overvalued at the offering by 74 %. Estimation errors increase with IPO firms’ leverage and underpricing, while decrease with age, size, and book-to-market ratios. Further tests find that post-IPO returns are lower for issues whose implied growth is more upward biased. Initial Public Offerings, DCF model, valuation, growth rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{valuation}} of companies going public in Europe. We find {{that most of}} the IPOs in the period 1995 - 2001 were valued by underwriters using the Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) model and/or the multiples approach. We propose a methodology to infer the growth rates <b>implied</b> in <b>offer</b> prices. Reverse-engineering DCF valuations, we back out implied growth rates of free cash flow over five years. We find that forecasted cash flows are higher than actual realizations. By comparing the IPO prices to the fair values obtained substituting the actual ex-post cash flows in the DCF model, we find that the median IPO firm is overvalued at the offering by 74 %. The cross-sectional determinants of such forecast errors are market-to-book ratio, leverage at the IPO, net earnings, underpricing, and firm’s age and size (these latter negatively related). We also find evidence of a negative market reaction to post-IPO disclosure of cash flows lower than expectations...|$|R

40|$|The GARDNER's {{stability}} {{theory is}} vital for linear modeling and empirical design of the 2 nd and 3 rd order charge-pump phase locked loop (CP-PLL). This criterion is general to identify the stability boundary in the steady state. It has been particularly applied to the PLL with a conventional current switched charge-pump (CSCP). Ideally, the CSCP supplies symmetrical pump currents. In some applications a voltage switched charge-pump (VSCP) is <b>implied,</b> which <b>offers</b> design simplicity and low cost. The VSCP architecture delivers an unequal amount of pump currents to the loop filter (LF), which introduces an additional and curious non-linearity in the behavior. This peculiarity buried in the second order voltage switched CP-PLL may disqualify it in several serious applications, where a symmetrical pump current is suitable. In this paper GARDNER's stability boundary is investigated by making iterative transient simulations using the event-driven model of the second order voltage switched CP-PLL. The simulated results near fixed point from the second order voltage switched CP-PLL show that, the stability boundary is non-conservative in such system, eradicating the overloading from the current switched charge-pump...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study equilibrium in a labour market in which identical firms post wage-contracts and ex-ante identical workers search on the job. The main novelty {{of this paper is to}} generate dispersion in contract offers by allowing firms to condition their offers on workers' initial experience and employment status although these characteristics do not affect productivity. In this context I show that changes in firms' information set at the moment of recruiting can have strong effects on wage dispersion and turnover without changing the agents' payoffs. I construct an equilibrium in which firms compete in promotion contracts. Employed and more experience workers are offered better contracts with shorter time-to-promotion periods. This <b>implies</b> contract <b>offers</b> are disperse within and between experience levels. The earnings distribution within the firm is then such that workers who have acquired more "outside" firm experience and more tenure are higher in the earnings scale. This generates workers cohort effects within a firm that depend on the level of experience at which they where hired. ...|$|R

Applying this perspective to Islamic fundamentalism, Cahoone identifies its conflict with the West as representing the break between two of three historically distinctive forms of reason.

We build on previous work (Dey and Flinn (2008) and Guler, Guvenen and Violante (2011)) to propose a novel identification strategy of the risk aversion parameters and a specification test. We find that ignoring the household as unit of decision-making has relevant empirical consequences. In estimation, the individual search specification <b>implies</b> gender wage <b>offers</b> differentials 200 % larger than the household search specification. In the application, the individual search specification implies gender differentials in lifetime utility inequality 74 % larger.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the feedback ratios in a buck converter with pulse width modulation and an inert output filter, with {{the ultimate goal of}} minimizing the duration of the transient processes. Feedback ratios in buck converters with pulse width modulation are conveniently adjustable using linear approximation for the neighborhood of the steady-state operating conditions. In the presence of an inert output filter or large input ripple, however, a pulse width modulator operates in saturation mode for a prolonged period of time (with a duty cycle of 0 or 1), which leads to losses in the estimated performance and to slowing down the transient processes. The solution we <b>offer</b> <b>implies</b> introducing a ‘fictional under-frequency’ of a pulse width modulator in order to calculate the feedback ratios separately for the transient process and, upon completion of the transient process, using the feedback ratios calculated for the base pulse width modulator frequency of conversion...|$|R
