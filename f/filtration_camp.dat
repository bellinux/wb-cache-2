25|$|Moiseyevsky {{was posted}} to the Moscow Military District when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. At the {{beginning}} of September, he was appointed commander of the 303rd Rifle Division, part of the 24th Army. Moiseyevsky led the division during the Yelnya Offensive, after which the division defended its sector. After holding its position for 15 days, the division was encircled after {{the beginning of}} Operation Typhoon, the German attack on Moscow, on 5 October. Moiseyevsky and his division were encircled in the Spas-Demensk Pocket, only breaking out in December. After exiting the pocket he was screened in the Abinsky NKVD <b>filtration</b> <b>camp</b> to ensure his loyalty. In January 1942, Moiseyevsky became deputy commander of the 160th Rifle Division.|$|E
25|$|Saprykin {{became a}} platoon commander, a company commander, and a {{battalion}} commander. By October 1941 he was assistant {{chief of staff}} of the 845th Rifle Regiment of the 303rd Rifle Division. South of Yelnya in early October, the regiment was surrounded. Saprykin broke out and reached Soviet lines in December. He was sent to an NKVD <b>filtration</b> <b>camp.</b> On 15 June 1942 he was sentenced by the military tribunal of the 16th Rifle Division under Article 193 of the RSFSR Criminal Code to ten years imprisonment. Saprykin's sentence was suspended and he was sent to the front with a penal battalion. After being wounded, he was transferred to the 612th Rifle Regiment of the 144th Rifle Division in a month. From 17 July 1942 he became a company commander, {{assistant chief of staff}}, and later led the regiment's 2nd Rifle Battalion.|$|E
25|$|Moiseyevsky {{joined the}} Red Army in 1919 and {{fought in the}} Russian Civil War. Later, he became an officer and {{political}} commissar, fighting in the 1929 Sino-Soviet conflict. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Moiseyevsky took command of the 303rd Rifle Division in September 1941, leading it in the Yelnya Offensive and the Battle of Moscow, during which it was destroyed in the Spas-Demensk pocket. After reaching Soviet lines and being screened in a NKVD <b>filtration</b> <b>camp,</b> he became deputy commander of the 160th Rifle Division in January 1942.

50|$|Birze {{was born}} into {{the family of a}} {{municipal}} employee in Rūjiena. He completed primary school in 1933. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, Birze joined the Young Communist League. He was arrested in July 1941, after the Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany. He was first held in prison in Valmiera, then transferred to the Salaspils concentration camp. After this he was assigned to do forced labor in the construction of a hangar at the Spilve Airport in Riga. In July 1944 he was among 1,200 people transported to Germany and interned in the Buchenwald concentration camp. In April 1945, during the evacuation of the camp, Birze managed to escape. He tried to return home through Poland, where he was arrested and held from May until September in an NKVD <b>filtration</b> <b>camp</b> in Hrodna. The time he spent in these camps and prisons is reflected in his literary works, especially in his novel Yet Icebound Rivers Flow.|$|E

5000|$|NKVD {{screening}} and <b>filtration</b> <b>camps</b> (Проверочно-фильтрационные лагеря НКВД СССР), originally known as NKVD special-purpose camps / NKVD special camps (лагеря специального назначения НКВД СССР, спецлагеря НКВД), were camps for the {{screening of the}} Soviet soldiers returned from enemy imprisonment or encirclement. By the end of World War II they handled screening of all people from the Soviet territories occupied by Nazi Germany. The NKVD special-purpose camps were established by NKVD Order No. 001735 of December 28, 1941, titled [...] "О создании специальных лагерей для бывших военнослужащих Красной Армии, находившихся в плену и в окружении противника" [...] ("On the establishment of special camps for former soldiers of the Red Army who were in captivity, or were surrounded by the enemy").

2500|$|Multiple sources {{state that}} Soviet POWs, on {{their return to}} the Soviet Union, were treated as traitors (see Order No. 270). According to some sources, over 1.5 million {{surviving}} Red Army soldiers imprisoned by the Germans {{were sent to the}} Gulag. However, that is a confusion with two other types of camps. During and after World War II, freed POWs went to special [...] "filtration" [...] camps. Of these, by 1944, more than 90 percent were cleared, and about 8 percent were arrested or condemned to penal battalions. In 1944, they were sent directly to reserve military formations to be cleared by the NKVD. Further, in 1945, about 100 <b>filtration</b> <b>camps</b> were set for repatriated Ostarbeiter, POWs, and other displaced persons, which processed more than 4,000,000 people. By 1946, the major part of the population of these camps were cleared by NKVD and either sent home or conscripted (see table for details). 226,127 out of 1,539,475 POWs were transferred to the NKVD, i.e. the Gulag.|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis deals with two pore forming toxins, namely Arcanobacterium pyogenes pyolysin and Streptococcus agalactiae CAMP factor. Pyolysin (PLO) belongs to the homologous group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. In chapter 2, it is shown that PLO can form small oligomers in solution, without the requirement for any membranes or membrane lipids. These small oligomers may aggregate into larger ones on membranes; however, in solution, they apparently do not grow by addition of further monomers, as their size is virtually unaffected by variations of incubation time or toxin concentration. The small, solution-derived oligomers retain hemolytic activity. The membrane lesions observed by electron microscopy {{are similar to those}} that are formed by monomeric PLO, except that they are mostly incomplete and arc-shaped, as opposed to the predominantly ring-shaped ones formed by monomeric PLO when directly incubated with membranes. This structural difference corresponds to a detectable difference in functional pore size, as determined by marker release experiments. Thus, arc-shaped PLO oligomers may form functional pores of reduced size. In chapter 3, we show that liposomes that contain phosphatidylcholine and ceramide but no cholesterol or other sterol are susceptible to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pyolysin. Pyolysin, at a low rate, forms small oligomers in solution. The solution-derived oligomers are more effective on ceramide-containing liposomes than the monomeric toxin. In contrast, they have much lower activity on liposome membranes that contain cholesterol but no ceramide. Our findings therefore show that at least one member of the ‘cholesterol-dependent cytolysins’ is in fact not strictly dependent on the sterol. In addition, in conjunction with previous data, they suggest that the requirement for cholesterol involves early or intermediate stages of oligomer formation, rather than the final event of membrane insertion. Chapter 4 of this thesis concerns Streptococcus agalactiae CAMP factor. CAMP factor has previously been reported to bind the Fc fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and has therefore also been called ‘protein B’, in analogy to protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. We attempted to characterize the interaction of protein B with IgG in more detail. In contrast to protein A, CAMP factor does not inhibit the activation of complement by hemolysin antibodies bound to sheep red cell surfaces. IgG also failed to inhibit the cohemolytic activity of CAMP factor, which it displays on sphingomyelinase-treated sheep red cells; this is in disagreement with previous findings. After co-incubation, CAMP factor and IgG were cleanly separated by gel <b>filtration.</b> Therefore, <b>CAMP</b> factor does not detectably bind to IgG...|$|R
