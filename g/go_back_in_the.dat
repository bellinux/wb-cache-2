But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected what I was doing, I would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
500|$|According to McEntire, Clarkson was {{the first}} singer to pair up with her for the album [...] (2007). She also claimed that [...] "Because of You" [...] was not the {{original}} song {{to be included in}} the album; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson, titled [...] "A Lot Like You." [...] McEntire explained that it was Narvel, her husband, who convinced her to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and record [...] "Because of You" [...] after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song. She expressed, [...] "Narvel saw it. That wasn't one of the songs we had talked about recording – matter of fact, Kelly and I had already recorded a song, 'A Lot Like You,' for the duet project, and he said, 'You've got to do this one together,' so we did." [...] Musically, the song is different from the original version. Thom Jhurek of Allmusic described the duet version as [...] "a big, overblown power ballad" [...] which incorporates [...] "guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals." [...] The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet, giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed [...] "unnecessary" [...] by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics. The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15, 2007, as the lead single from the album. It was added to country radio playlists on May 28, 2007.|$|E

500|$|While Rochussen {{had been}} {{glad to see}} him <b>go,</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands van Hoëvell fared better politically. He was vindicated when the {{government}} canceled the acceptance of his forced resignation, and he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the events of May 1848. The publication of the Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië, which had stopped at his expulsion from Batavia, was resumed in 1849, now in a less repressive environment. For some pamphlets, he used the pseudonym Jeronymus. In September 1849, {{he was elected to the}} House of Representatives of the Netherlands for the Liberal party and he remained a member of parliament until 1862. He was one of only a handful of Dutch parliamentarians who had actually been to the East Indies, and often spoke eloquently on colonial matters in parliament. He became [...] "one of the most ferocious critics" [...] of the Cultivation System, the government-run system (already criticized by W.Bosch and others) that demanded that the local peasantry set aside a significant portion of their land to grow crops for the Dutch to export. Van Hoëvell was a proponent of private ownership, and argued that the system, besides being immoral, was also economically ineffective. His criticism of Dutch colonial practices extended to the Dutch West India Company; he was a supporter of abolitionism at a time when Dutch colonists owned tens of thousands of slaves, mainly on plantations in Surinam.|$|E
