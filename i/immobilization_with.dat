50|$|Once {{the process}} is recognized, it should be treated via the VIPs — {{vascular}} management, infection management and prevention, and pressure relief. Aggressively pursuing these three strategies will progress the healing trajectory of the wound. Pressure relief (off-loading) and <b>immobilization</b> <b>with</b> total contact casting (TCC) are critical to helping ward off further joint destruction.|$|E
50|$|Management {{depends on}} the {{severity}} of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. The cast is applied with the distal fragment in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation. A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require closed reduction. There is some evidence that <b>immobilization</b> <b>with</b> the wrist in dorsiflexion as opposed to palmarflexion results in less redisplacement and better functional status. Significant angulation and deformity may require an open reduction and internal fixation or external fixation. The volar forearm splint is best for temporary immobilization of forearm, wrist and hand fractures, including Colles' fracture.There are several established instability criteria:dorsal tilt >20°,comminuted fracture,abruption of the ulnar styloid process,intraarticular displacement >1mm,loss of radial height >2mm.|$|E

30|$|The {{new method}} of enzyme <b>immobilization</b> <b>with</b> GA using the silicalite-modified {{stainless}} steel electrodes (GOx-SME-GA) was {{compared with the}} traditional method of enzyme immobilization by cross-linking with GA, in which non-modified stainless steel electrodes were used (GOx-GA). The GOx-SME-GA biosensors were characterized by 4 – 5 times higher sensitivity than GOx-GA. The GOx-SME-GA biosensors demonstrated storage stability with only 29  % loss of activity after 18  days, satisfactory reproducibility of biosensor preparation (RSD— 18  %), and good signal reproducibility (RSD of glucose determination— 7  %). It was concluded that GA in complex with silicalite sufficiently enhances enzyme adsorption on stainless steel electrodes.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{prospective study}} was conducted to determine whether <b>immobilization</b> <b>with</b> the arm in external rotation would decrease the rate of recurrence after initial traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Forty patients with initial shoulder dislocations were assigned to (1) conventional immobilization in internal rotation (IR group, N = 20) or (2) a new method of immobilization in external rotation (ER group, N = 20). The recurrence rate was 30 % in the IR group and 0 % in the ER group at a mean 15. 5 months.
