50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>label</b> (ESL) {{system is}} used by {{retailers}} for displaying product pricing on shelves. Typically, electronic display modules {{are attached to the}} front edge of retail shelving. These modules use electronic paper (E-paper) or liquid-crystal display (LCD) to show the current product price to the customer. E-paper is currently trending in the ESL market as it provides crisp display and supports full graphic imaging. A communication network allows the price display to be automatically updated whenever a product price is changed. This communication network is the true differentiation and what really makes ESL a viable solution. The wireless communication must support reasonable range, speed, battery life, and reliability. The means of wireless communication can be based on radio, infrared or even visible light communication. Currently, the ESL market leans heavily towards radio frequency based ESL solutions.|$|E

40|$|We study item-pricing laws (which {{require that}} each item {{in a store}} be {{individually}} marked with a price sticker) and examine and quantify their costs and benefits. On the cost side, we argue that item-pricing laws increase the retailers' costs, forcing them to raise prices. We test this prediction using data on retail prices from large supermarket chains in the Tri-State area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The Tri-States offer a unique setting - a natural experiment - to study item-pricing laws because the states vary {{in their use of}} item-pricing laws, but otherwise offer similar markets and chains operating in a close proximity to each other in a relatively homogenous socioeconomic environment. We use two datasets, one emphasizing the breadth in coverage across products and the other across stores. We find consistent evidence across products, product categories, stores, chains, states, and sampling periods, that the prices at stores facing item-pricing laws are higher than the prices at stores not facing the item pricing laws by about 25 cents or 9. 6 percent per item. We also have data from supermarket chains that would be subject to item-pricing laws but are exempted from item pricing requirement because they use costly <b>electronic</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>label</b> systems. Using this data as a control, we find that the <b>electronic</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>label</b> store prices fall between the item-pricing law and non-item-pricing law store prices: they are lower than the item-pricing law store prices by about 15 cents per item on average, but are higher than the non-item-pricing law store prices by about 10 cents per item on average. On the benefit side, we study the frequency and the magnitude of supermarket pricing errors, which the item-pricing laws are supposed to prevent. We quantify the benefits of the IPLs by conservatively assuming that they successfully accomplish their mission of preventing all price mistakes. Comparing the costs of item-pricing laws to their benefits, we find that the item-pricing law costs are at least an order of magnitude higher than the benefits. ...|$|E

30|$|Most {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} battery-powered nodes and are limited to hundreds of nodes. Battery replacement is a very costly operation and {{a key factor in}} limiting successful large-scale deployments. The recent advances in both energy harvesters and low-power communication systems hold promise for deploying large-scale wireless green-powered sensor networks (WGSNs). This will enable new applications and will eliminate environmentally unfriendly battery disposal. This paper explores the use of energy harvesters to scavenge power for nodes in a WSN. The design and implementation of a generic energy-harvesting framework, suited for a WSN simulator as well as a real-life testbed, are proposed. These frameworks are used to evaluate whether a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme is sufficiently reliable for use in emerging large-scale energy harvesting <b>electronic</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>label</b> (EHESL) systems (i.e., 12000 labels in a star topology). Both the simulator and testbed experiments yielded an average success rate up to 92 %, with an arrival rate of 40 transceive cycles per second. We have demonstrated that our generic energy-harvesting framework is useful for WGSN research because the simulator allowed us to verify the achieved results on the real-life testbed and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) at Strathmore UniversityPrice display {{is an integral part}} of the shopping experience in retail stores in Kenya. It helps the customer make an informed purchase decision while in the product aisle without the need for involvement of retail store staff. Current paper based price displays on retail store shelves lack reliability, durability and accuracy required for the retail stores operations. They are susceptible to wear and tear, and can be tampered with. It is also very difficult to tell exactly what price is currently displayed for a specific product on a shelf without being physically at that location. They also act as a bottleneck to these operations where other systems from the store management to the point of sale systems are computerized. This research aimed to come up with an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Shelf</b> <b>Label</b> system that will allow for real-time price and advertisement information update and display on retail store shelves. It will be able to integrate with store management and point of sale systems seamlessly and facilitate instant price changes when necessary. Similar systems are already in use in developed countries with varied rates of adoption and success. The key differentiator for the architecture of the proposed model is that it also provides an advertising platform where retailers can charge vendors to advertise their products. This not only creates various cross-sell and up-sell opportunities for the vendors, but also provides an income generation avenue for the retailers, which overcomes the initial setup costs that have otherwise made retail stores particularly in Kenya shy away from such systems in the past. It will, in the long-term, also provide a platform for analytics for both retail stores and vendors to gauge correlation between customer purchase patterns and the prices of their products as well as competitors. The research is a form of applied research. The sample size was computed through convenience non-probability sampling. Most of the respondents recommended an automated system hence the reason for creating this prototype. The prototype was developed using v-process methodology since the clarity of the user requirements was high and the technical expertise needed was readily available. The prototype produced 98 % accuracy in real-time price information update and display with alerts for the non-successful updates generated by the prototype to inform the operator so that they resend the information...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an inkjet-printed electrochromic(EC) paper display {{integrated}} with passive UHF-RFID tag is introduced {{as a solution}} for passive <b>electronic</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>labels</b> (ESL). To address the system challenges of the limited power budget of passive UHF-RFID tags and the material aging of EC display, a feedback comparator integrated digital displaydriver is proposed based {{on the study of}} electrochromic, bi-stable and aging features of the EC display. Modularized baseband with different enableconditions and clock domains is implemented in the system design level. Moreover, to maintain the system functions when the input power is lower than the display refresh power, a duty-cycled power management unit (PMU) is activated to reduce the load current during energy scavenging and drive the display in short intervals, enabling the fast charging of the voltage rectifier and the correct output of the regulated supply for the core circuit. The design is fabricated in a 0. 18 -um CMOS process with an area of 2. 25 mm 2. Fed with EPC C 1 G 2 protocol write command, experiments demonstrate correct refresh of EC display with 4 cm 2 effective area. System sensitivity at the antenna reference point is basically immune to the display load. Further improvements can be achieved after careful chip-to-antenna impedance matching and PMU efficiency optimization. Qc 20130718 </p...|$|R
