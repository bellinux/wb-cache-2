50|$|As the {{installation}} of oil platforms continued in the North Sea, in areas with poor ground conditions such as soft clays, {{they were designed to}} survive even higher storm waves. These platforms were founded on a system of cylindrical skirts that were penetrated into the ground under combined gravity load and underpressure. The oil platform at the Gullfaks C field was equipped with 22 m long skirts.

50|$|The {{origins of}} the 1970s village lie during the {{expansion}} of the oil industry in the 1970s. Specific locations around the coast of Scotland were developed for the construction sites to build oil rig platforms. Portavadie and Polphail on the west coast of the Cowal peninsula, on Loch Fyne, was chosen as one such location. It provided a sheltered port, a geological feature in which to build a dry dock and a construction yard for the building of deep water oil <b>gravity</b> <b>platforms.</b> Land was purchased for the whole development by the Government for the construction yard and adjacent village that was built between 1975 and 1977, to house up to 500 workers. The impetus to build the yard was based on future forecasting and was to be operated by the people living in Pollphail village, but structural design issues of the oil <b>gravity</b> <b>platforms,</b> cost implications and inflexibility in the sector at the time led to no orders being placed at the yard.|$|R

40|$|Two-phase flows {{are present}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{applications}} for spacecraft thermal control systems design. Bubble formation and detachment is an integral part of the two-phase flow science. The authors objective is to experimentally investigate the effects of liquid cross velocity, gas velocity, and nozzle diameter on the bubble diameter at detachment under reduced and normal gravity and under relatively low gas flow rates. Results from ground (1 g) and reduced gravity experiments will be presented in this paper. For the 1 g experiment, a flow loop was designed and built to accommodate a range of liquid and gas flow rates. The reduced gravity experiment was conducted on the NASA DC- 9 reduced <b>gravity</b> <b>platform</b> using the two-phase flow loop qualified for operation on the low-gravity platform. Flow visualization is accomplished using a high speed 500 frames/s camera. The results suggest that the existence of buoyancy force contributes to the faster detachment of bubbles. Buoyancy helps the detachment process which results in smaller bubbles being formed. In reduced gravity, although drag force is present, the virtual non-existence of buoyant force results in larger bubbles and longer times for detachment. Theoretical predictions are also presented in this paper and seem to agree with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{performance}} of concrete offshore gravity platforms is investigated. Aspects of dynamic structural analysis are discussed with particular reference to offshore gravity platforms, including soil-structure and water-structure interaction. Results of a seismic hazard analysis using currently available information are presented, and appropriate acceleration response spectra for design purposes are suggested. Site response effects are examined {{to investigate whether}} seismic hazard analysis results could be adjusted in a rational manner {{to account for the}} response of flexible nonlinear foundation materials. Artificial earthquake records are discussed and a suite of artificial accelerograms are generated to match the suggested design acceleration response spectra for offshore platforms in New Zealand. An experimental testing programme was undertaken to examine the strength and ductility characteristics of circular hollow reinforced and partially prestressed concrete members. Six columns were tested, representing scale models of members which could be used in the critical regions of possible offshore concrete platform configurations. A companion theoretical study was carried out to examine the strength and ductility of circular hollow sections. Results are presented in a design chart form suitable for use by designers. Finally, preliminary design studies were carried out for two different concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>platform</b> types to assess their likely feasibility. Of particular interest was the required distribution of strength to resist moderate earthquake effects and the ductility demands during severe earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations {{have been conducted}} to examine the behaviour of small icebergs and bergy bits in unidirectional regular waves. A nonlinear time-domain method based on the equivalent motion concept and a corresponding computational algorithm are presented for predicting the motion and trajectory of small ice masses drifting in an open seaway and near a gravity base platform. The general equations of motion of a rigid body are applied, and the wave forces are determined as {{the sum of the}} resultant of wave-induced pressures integrated over the instantaneous wetted surface of the body (the Froude-Krylov forces) and the flow disturbance induced by the presence of the body as determined by the equivalent motion method. The algorithm is used to predict the motion and trajectories of free drifting and towed spherical models in small and large amplitude waves. The computed values are found to be in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements outside the heave resonance range where the motions are over-predicted. The motions of the ice mass are also simulated near a cylindrical <b>gravity</b> <b>platform</b> taking into account the effect of the waves diffracted by the structure. Large heave motions are predicted in close vicinity of the platform. In addition to instances where collisions were predicted, the ice drifted around or maintained a stationary position in front of the structure. It is concluded that the method can be applied to provide predictions of the kinematic parameters of motion of small bodies drifting in waves...|$|E
40|$|Flow boiling and {{condensation}} {{have been}} identified as two key mechanisms for heat transport that are vital for achieving weight and volume reduction as well as performance enhancement in future space systems. Since inertia driven flows are demanding on power usage, lower flows are desirable. However, in microgravity, lower flows are dominated by forces other than inertia (like the capillary force). It is of paramount interest to investigate limits of low flows beyond which the flow is inertial enough to be gravity independent. One of the objectives of the Flow Boiling and Condensation Flight Experiment sets to investigate these limits for flow boiling and condensation. A two-phase flow loop consisting of a Flow Boiling Module and two Condensation Modules has been developed to experimentally study flow boiling condensation heat transfer in the reduced gravity environment provided by the reduced <b>gravity</b> <b>platform.</b> This effort supports the development of a flow boiling and condensation facility for the International Space Station (ISS). The closed loop test facility is designed to deliver the test fluid, FC- 72 to the inlet of any one of the test modules at specified thermodynamic and flow conditions. The zero-g-aircraft tests will provide subcooled and saturated flow boiling critical heat flux and flow condensation heat transfer data over wide range of flow velocities. Additionally, these tests will verify the performance of all gravity sensitive components, such as evaporator, condenser and accumulator associated with the two-phase flow loop. We will present in this paper the breadboard development and testing results which consist of detailed performance evaluation of the heater and condenser combination in reduced and normal gravity. We will also present the design of the reduced gravity aircraft rack and the results of the ground flow boiling heat transfer testing performed with the Flow Boiling Module that is designed to investigate flow boiling heat transfer and Critical Heat Flux (CHF) phenomena...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} concepts {{regarding the}} development of an Altered <b>Gravity</b> <b>Platform</b> (AGP) that will serve as a research platform for human space exploration. Space flight causes a multitude of physiological problems, many of which are due to gravity level transitions. Going from Earth’s gravity to microgravity generates fluid shifts, space motion sickness, cardiovascular deconditioning among other changes, and returning to a gravity environment again puts the astronauts under similar stressors. A prolonged stay in microgravity provokes additional deleterious changes such as bone loss, muscle atrophy and loss of coordination or specific psychological stresses. To prepare for future manned space exploration missions, a ground-based research test bed for validating countermeasures against the deleterious effects of g-level transitions is needed. The proposed AGP is a large rotating facility (diameter > 150 m), where gravity levels ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 5 g are generated, covering short episodes or during prolonged stays of weeks or even months. On this platform, facilities are built where a crew of 6 to 8 humans can live autonomously. Adaptation from 1 g to higher g levels can be studied extensively and monitored continuously. Similarly, re-adaptation back to 1 g, after a prolonged period of altered g can also be investigated. Study of the physiological and psychological adaptation to changing g-levels will provide instrumental and predictive knowledge to better define the ultimate countermeasures that are needed for future successful manned space exploration missions to the Moon, Mars and elsewhere. The AGP initiative will allow scientific experts in Europe and worldwide to investigate the necessary scientific, operational, and engineering inputs required for such space missions. Because so many different physiological systems are involved in adaptation to gravity levels, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial. One of the final and crucial steps is to verify the AGP concept through a large scientific community through feedback from various scientific societies. This facility will also serve clinical research on Earth, because a multitude of health problems such as osteoporosis, frailty of the elderly, inactivity, sarcopenia, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, cardiovascular problems, connective tissue ageing and immune deficiency, among others stand to benefit from the fundamental insights into the effects of our ever-present terrestrial gravity gained with such a novel research platform...|$|E

The novelty of this work is the Proportional Integral Ramp Quadratic PIRQ controller, which is employed to counteract the aerodynamic forces impeding the vehicles constant acceleration during the maneuver.

40|$|The {{relatively}} young discipline of astronautics {{represents one of}} the scientifically most fascinating and technologically advanced achievements of our time. The human exploration in space does not offer only extraordinary research possibilities but also demands high requirements from man and technology. The space environment provides a lot of attractive experimental tools towards the understanding of fundamental mechanism in natural sciences. It has been shown that especially reduced gravity and elevated radiation, two distinctive factors in space, influence the behavior of biological systems significantly. For this reason one of the key objectives on board of an earth orbiting laboratory is the research in the field of life sciences, covering the broad range from botany, human physiology and crew health up to biotechnology. The Columbus Module is the only European low <b>gravity</b> <b>platform</b> that allows researchers to perform ambitious experiments in a continuous time frame up to several months. Biolab is part of the initial outfitting of the Columbus Laboratory; it is a multi-user facility supporting research in the field of biology, e. g. effect of microgravity and space radiation on cell cultures, micro-organisms, small plants and small invertebrates. The Biolab IEC are projects designed to work in the automatic part of Biolab. In this moment in the TO- 53 department of Airbus Defence & Space (formerly Astrium) there are two experiments that are in phase C/D of the development and they are the subject of this thesis: CELLRAD and CYTOSKELETON. They will be launched in soft configuration, that means packed inside a block of foam that has the task to reduce the launch loads on the payload. Until 10 years ago the payloads which were launched in soft configuration were supposed to be structural safe by themselves and a specific structural analysis could be waived on them; {{with the opening of the}} launchers market to private companies (that are not under the direct control of the international space agencies), the requirements on the verifications of payloads are changed and they have become much more conservative. In 2012 a new random environment has been introduced due to the new Space-X launch specification that results to be particularly challenging for the soft launched payloads. The last ESA specification requires to perform structural analysis on the payload for combined loads (random vibration, quasi-steady acceleration and pressure). The aim of this thesis is to create FEM models able to reproduce the launch configuration and to verify that all the margins of safety are positive and to show how they change because of the new Space-X random environment. In case the results are negative, improved design solution are implemented.

The experimental investigation of the model platform’s response under cyclic vertical loading in silt foundation {{has been carried out}} to simulate daily process of oil storage and oil discharge in real seabed conditions. Total stress and pore pressure at stress concentration points is monitored by transducers. Based on Mohr-Coulomb’s strength theory and by MATLAB programming, the model platform data can get back to the real response of prototype platform to determine whether the foundation soil is stable. What is more, rational numerical simulation is also achieved. Two capacity options are tested: 500 tons and 1000 tons. When the caisson’s oil capacity is assumed 500 tons, the foundation soil is unconditionally stable; while the number reaches 1000 tons, local instability occurs, despite whole stability under most circumstances. The conclusion is drawn that upper loadings should not be applied instantly after suction penetration. In consideration of vertical oil loading alone, 1000 tons is the ultimate capacity and 500 tons or more is appropriate. This paper presents the dimensions of the designed platform, numerical simulation, laboratory model simulation, and ultimately provides referential resources for future design and construction in silt.

Instead of being randomly dispersed in agarose in the traditional assay, cells are captured into an agarose microwell array by <b>gravity.</b> The <b>platform</b> also expands from the size of a standard microscope slide to a 96 -well format, enabling parallel processing. Here we describe the protocols of using the chip to evaluate DNA damage caused by known genotoxic agents and the cellular repair response followed after exposure.

50|$|The LC {{interior}} is {{split into two}} zones — the driver side has access to functionality, while the passenger side is shielded and much simpler. The center of the interior experience is the steering wheel, which has a varying circumference to accommodate for different driving styles. In order to allow for easier grip and improve the feel, the paddle shifters are made from magnesium alloy. The 8-inch Thin Film Transistor LCD circular dial embedded in the instrument panel is a direct descendent of the LFA design — it moves side-to-side as the driver moves through the various menus and settings, and the appearance will change depending on the selected drive mode. Also borrowed from the LFA is the Drive Mode Select control, which is placed {{to the side of}} the instrument panel.The LC is the first car to be developed on the new Lexus front-engine/rear-wheel drive platform, dubbed the Global Architecture - Luxury (GA-L) platform. The GA-L platform will serve as the starting point for all future rear-wheel drive Lexus vehicles of the future, and it’s meant to provide lower overall mass, improved front/rear weight distribution (54/46 front/rear balance for the gas model, 52/48 for the hybrid), and a low center of <b>gravity.</b> The <b>platform</b> design allowed engineers to push the wheels out further towards the corners of the vehicle, reducing the height of the hood while still accommodating the new multilink suspension.

This is a modification of the classical bouncing ball problem and describes the transport of particles by surface waves. Phase and velocity maps cannot be expressed in the explicit form due to implicit formulations, and no formal analytical analyses is possible. Numerical analysis shows that the transition to chaos is produced via a period doubling route which is a common property for classical bouncers. These numerical analysis have been carried out for the conservative and for the viscous cases and also for elastic and for inelastic collisions. The bouncing process can be sensitive to the initial conditions and can be useful for control techniques which can dramatically increase the effectiveness of particle transport in practical applications. Finally, we also consider the mechanical model of a particle sliding on a surface which is also important because it has important physical implications such as the transportation of thin films in biomedical applications, among others...|$|R

Platform Inertial Matrix Block Diagonal Dominant Definition and Description In the joint space dynamics model of Stewart <b>platform,</b> <b>gravity</b> can be compensated by a feed-forward manner. The centrifugal force and the force cannot be considered. Therefore, the coupling relation between platform 6 branches is mainly reflected by the inertia matrix () JM q. The site of platform geometric structure is symmetry. As Figure 1 (a) shows, for the structure characteristics of the platform, after careful analysis, in the working space, matrix is blocking diagonal dominant. The matrix element distribution are showed in Figure 1 (b). The elements ⊗ absolute value are bigger than elements ×. This means the inertia coupling of two branches is most intense in the ball hinge adjacent. The inertia matrix is divided into...|$|R
