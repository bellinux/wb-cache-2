40|$|The {{purpose of}} this DOE-funded effort is to develop {{continuous}} processes for solvent extraction of coal {{for the production of}} carbon products. These carbon products include materials used in metals smelting, especially in the aluminum and steel industries, as well as porous carbon structural material referred to as ''carbon foam'' and carbon fibers. Table 1 provides an overview of the major markets for carbon products. Current sources of materials for these processes generally rely on petroleum distillation products or coal tar distillates obtained as a byproduct of metcoke production facilities. In the former case, the American materials industry, just as the energy industry, is dependent upon foreign sources of petroleum. In the latter case, metcoke production is decreasing every year due to the combined difficulties associated with poor economics and a significant environmental burden. Thus, a significant need exists for an <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> <b>process</b> which can used domestically obtained raw materials and which can still be very competitive economically...|$|E
40|$|What motivates {{manufacturing}} companies to make costly investments in producing in an <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> manner? The traditional {{argument is that}} such behaviour is value reducing, and that therefore, firms must be forced by regulation to invest in 'green' production processes. A counter-argument is that firms {{have an incentive to}} make environmental investments in an attempt to attract 'green' consumers and investors, hence gaining competitive advantage over their rivals. In this paper, we employ a game-theoretic approach that demonstrates that competing firms' incentives to make voluntary investments in environmental 'clean-up' are affected {{by the size of the}} investment costs and the extent of consumer and investor 'green' awareness. We argue that an increase in green behaviour can be induced by a combination of governmental subsidies for firms that invest in <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> production <b>processes,</b> together with an education program that promotes 'green' awareness amongst consumers, investors and the managers themselves...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} work is to {{identify}} an <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> coating <b>process</b> that will present lower influence in the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V fatigue strength. Axial fatigue tests of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy TiN, CrN and WC:H (tungsten containing diamond-like carbon) Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coated was evaluated. Decrease in fatigue life was observed for coated specimens in comparison to base metal. Scanning Electron Microscopy technique was used to observe crack origin sites and coating thickness. DLC coating provides higher Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy PVD coated fatigue strength due to lower defects presence and the chromium interlayer, which acts {{as a barrier to}} fatigue crack propagation...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{machining}} with internally cooled smart {{cutting tools}} {{is a smart}} solution for industrial applications, which have stringent manufacturing requirements such as contamination free machining (CFM), high material removal rate, low tool wear and better surface integrity. The absence of cutting fluid in CFM causes the cutting tool and the workpiece subject to great thermal loads owing to higher friction and adhesion, {{and as a result}} may increase the levels of tool wear drastically. The increase in cutting temperature may influence the chip morphology which in return producing metal chips in unfavourable ribbon or snarl forms. CFM is difficult to be realized as contaminants can be in various forms in the machining operation and to avoid them totally requires a very tight controlled condition. However, the ecological, economical and technological demands compel the manufacturing practitioners to implement <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> machining <b>process</b> (ECMP).

40|$|Biomass {{represents}} a large potential feedstock resource for <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> <b>processes</b> that produce power or chemicals. It {{lends itself to}} both biological and thermal conversion processes and both options are currently being explored. Hydrogen can be produced {{in a variety of}} ways. The majority of the hydrogen produced in this country is produced through natural gas reforming and is used as chemical feedstock in refinery operations. In this report we will examine the production of hydrogen by gasification of biomass. Biomass is defined as organic matter that is available on a renewable basis through natural processes or as a by-product of processes that use renewable resources. The majority of biomass is used in combustion processes, in mills that use the renewable resources, to produce electricity for end-use product generation. This report will explore the use of hydrogen as a fuel derived from gasification of three candidate biomass feedstocks: bagasse, switchgrass, and a nutshell mix that consists of 40 % almond nutshell, 40 % almond prunings, and 20 % walnut shell. In this report, an assessment of the technical and economic potential of producing hydrogen from biomass gasification is analyzed. The resource base was assessed to determine a process scale from feedstock costs and availability. Solids handling systems were researched. A GTI proprietary gasifier model was used in combination with a Hysys(reg. sign) design and simulation program to determine the amount of hydrogen that can be produced from each candidate biomass feed. Cost estimations were developed and government programs and incentives were analyzed. Finally, the barriers to the production and commercialization of hydrogen from biomass were determined. The end-use of the hydrogen produced from this system is small PEM fuel cells for automobiles. Pyrolysis of biomass was also considered. Pyrolysis is a reaction in which biomass or coal is partially vaporized by heating. Gasification is a more general term, and includes heating as well as the injection of other ''ingredients'' such as oxygen and water. Pyrolysis alone is a useful first step in creating vapors from coal or biomass that can then be processed in subsequent steps to make liquid fuels. Such products are not the objective of this project. Therefore pyrolysis {{was not included in the}} process design or in the economic analysis. High-pressure, fluidized bed gasification is best known to GTI through 30 years of experience. Entrained flow, in contrast to fluidized bed, is a gasification technology applied at much larger unit sizes than employed here. Coal gasification and residual oil gasifiers in refineries are the places where such designs have found application, at sizes on the order of 5 to 10 times larger than what has been determined for this study. Atmospheric pressure gasification is also not discussed. Atmospheric gasification has been the choice of all power system pilot plants built for biomass to date, except for the Varnamo plant in Sweden, which used the Ahlstrom (now Foster Wheeler) pressurized gasifier. However, for fuel production, the disadvantage of the large volumetric flows at low pressure leads to the pressurized gasifier being more economical...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} coatings, Mg-Al hydrotalcite and aragonite (CaCO(3)), {{were produced}} on die-cast AZ 91 D Mg alloy (Mg- 9 wt. %Al- 1 wt. %Zn) through <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> methods. The corrosion resistance and human {{mesenchymal stem cell}} adhesion properties of the coatings on AZ 91 D were investigated. Results showed that through <b>environmentally</b> <b>clean</b> methods, both Mg-Al hydrotalcite and aragonite CaCO(3) surface coatings could be produced on AZ 91 D surfaces. These coatings increased the corrosion potential and polarization resistance and decreased the corrosion rate of AZ 91 D in simulated body fluid. Both surface coatings also improved stem cell spreading and interaction in culture. Further long-term animal testing is suggested before these surface coatings can be recommended for use in clinical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
