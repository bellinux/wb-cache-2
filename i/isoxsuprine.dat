50|$|<b>Isoxsuprine</b> and {{pentoxifylline}} are two {{commonly used}} vasodilators in equine medicine. <b>Isoxsuprine</b> {{has been shown}} to have vasodilatory and red blood cell deformability properties. Pentoxifylline {{has been shown to}} decrease blood viscosity, reduce platelet aggregation, and increase red blood cell deformability. These properties are thought to improve blood flow to the digit, and makes them popular drugs for treatment of navicular disease and laminitis. However, some studies have shown oral <b>isoxsuprine</b> and pentoxifylline to have little to no effect on digital blood flow. The lack of efficacy of <b>isoxsuprine</b> may be partially due to its poor oral bioavailability (2.2%) and high first pass effect. While pentoxyfylline has a better bioavailability after oral dosing, its absorption may decrease with repeated administration. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to reduce lameness in horses with experimentally induced laminitis and has inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), so it may be beneficial for laminitis treatment despite its uncertain effects on digital blood flow.|$|E

To investigate if veterinary treatment of cows could lead to residues of <b>isoxsuprine</b> in the hair of their newborn calves, an animal experiment was performed. Four cows, treated on veterinary indication with <b>isoxsuprine</b> lactate (Duphaspasmin) before a caesarian section, were included in the experiment. Hair samples from cows and from their calves were analyzed. The animals were shaved every week for 16 weeks and levels of <b>isoxsuprine</b> were measured in hair.

40|$|The {{maternal}} {{portion of}} the bovine placenta receives blood mainly from the uterine arteries (AUT) and the fetal portion from the umbilical arteries (AUM). Placental perfusion is crucial for fetal development and undergoes adaptive changes during pregnancy according to the fetal requirements. One goal {{of this study was}} to investigate changes in Doppler sonographic measurements of blood vessels that supply blood to the placenta in cows during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. Another goal was to examine how these measurements are affected by three drugs commonly used in cows at the time of parturition. Nine cows underwent Doppler sonographic examination of the AUT ipsilateral and contralateral to the pregnant horn and one AUM three times per week during the last 4 weeks of gestation. This was followed by the randomized administration of one of the three following experimental drugs per day: <b>isoxsuprine</b> (200 mg/cow, iv), xylazine (2 mg/ 100 kg, iv), and lidocaine for epidural anesthesia (100 mg/cow). Doppler sonographic examination was repeated 30 minutes after medication. Maternal pulse rate increased during the study period (P < 0. 001), and the diameter of the contralateral AUT was smaller in the last week before birth than in the two preceding weeks. The resistance index (RI) of the ipsilateral AUT was smaller in the last week than in the first 2 weeks of the study period.

40|$|The massive {{increase}} in {{size of the}} fetus and uterus in the last trimester is accompanied by an increasing demand for nutrients and oxygen, and {{it is assumed that}} this demand is met by increasing uterine and fetal perfusion. The goals of this study were to measure the perfusion of the uterine arteries and the placentomes in the last month of gestation and to investigate the effect of epidural anesthesia and <b>isoxsuprine</b> on perfusion. During the last month of gestation, eight Braunvieh cows underwent nine color Doppler sonographic examinations of the uterine arteries to determine diameter (DM), pulse rate (PR), resistance index, time-averaged maximum blood flow velocity (TAMV), and blood flow volume (BFV), and power-mode Doppler sonography was used to determine perfusion of placentomes. The PR increased (P < 0. 001), and the BFV and TAMV of the ipsilateral uterine artery decreased between 4. 5 and 0. 5 weeks prepartum (BFV, 236. 8 ± 65. 80 and 208 ± 41. 52 cm 3 /s, P < 0. 01; TAMV, 140. 0 ± 26. 53 cm/s and 125. 2 ± 18. 46 cm/s, P < 0. 05). After sonographic examination, the cows received epidural administration of local anesthetic (100 -mg lidocaine) in the sacrococcygeal space or <b>isoxsuprine</b> (200 mg/cow, iv), and the sonographic measurements were repeated 30 minutes later. After epidural anesthesia, the TAMV and BFV of the contralateral uterine artery increased by 5. 4 % (P < 0. 05) and 7. 9 % (P < 0. 01). In the placentomes of the gravid uterine horn, the relative placentome perfusion and the color pixel grading (Cp) increased by 10. 1 % (P < 0. 05) and 11. 5 % (P < 0. 01) after epidural anesthesia. After <b>isoxsuprine,</b> the DM, PR, and BFV increased by 4. 7 %, 49. 3 %, and 16. 9 % in the ipsilateral uterine artery and by 10. 8 %, 48. 7 %, and 22. 8 %, respectively in the contralateral uterine artery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{metastasis}} is {{the prime}} cause of death from malignancies, there is vibrant interest to discover options {{for the management of}} the different mechanistic steps of tumour spreading. Some approved pharmaceuticals exhibit activities against diseases they have not been developed for. In order to discover such activities that might attenuate lymph node metastasis, we investigated 225 drugs, which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: A three-dimensional cell co-culture assay was utilised measuring tumour cell-induced disintegrations of the lymphendothelial wall through which tumour emboli can intravasate as a limiting step in lymph node metastasis of ductal breast cancer. The disintegrated areas in the lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were induced by 12 (S) -HETE, which is secreted by MCF- 7 tumour cell spheroids, and are called 'circular chemorepellent induced defects' (CCIDs). The putative mechanisms by which active drugs prevented the formation of entry gates were investigated by western blotting, NF-κB activity assay and by the determination of 12 (S) -HETE synthesis. RESULTS: Acetohexamide, nifedipin, <b>isoxsuprine</b> and proadifen dose dependently inhibited the formation of CCIDs in LEC monolayers and inhibited markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and migration. The migration of LECs is a prerequisite of CCID formation, and these drugs either repressed paxillin levels or the activities of myosin light chain 2, or myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase. <b>Isoxsuprine</b> inhibited all three migration markers, and <b>isoxsuprine</b> and acetohexamide suppressed the synthesis of 12 (S) -HETE, whereas proadifen and nifedipin inhibited NF-κB activation. Both the signalling pathways independently cause CCID formation. CONCLUSION: The targeting of different mechanisms was most likely the reason for synergistic effects of different drug combinations on the inhibition of CCID formation. Furthermore, the treatment with drug combinations allowed also a several-fold reduction in drug concentrations. These results encourage further screening of approved drugs and their in vivo testing...|$|E

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that environmental factors early in life, particularly related to hygiene and infections, seem {{to be involved in the}} increase of asthma and allergic disease observed recently in developed countries. The possible effect of these factors also in utero have yet to be completely clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between infective and uterus related complications during pregnancy, as well as related drug factors, with atopic and nonatopic asthma in children. Methods: This was a case-controlled study enrolling 338 children with asthma and 467 controls, who had never suffered from wheeze or asthma. Fever episodes, flu episodes, threatened abortions and related drug factors were retrospectively assessed by parental report via a standardized questionnaire. Atopy was determined by skin-prick tests to 10 prevalent allergens at the time of examination. Results: Flu episodes during pregnancy were significantly associated with development of asthma in children [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1. 91; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 - 3. 2], mainly with nonatopic asthma. Fever episodes showed similar results (aOR 2. 16; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 9), but were associated with both atopic and nonatopic asthma. The effect seems mainly due to flu and fever episodes contracted in the third trimester. Exposure to <b>isoxsuprine</b> was significantly associated with asthma (aOR 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 08 - 2. 19) while threatened abortions were more frequent in the asthma group than in controls, although the difference was statistically significant only when such events occurred in the second trimester (aOR 2. 06; 95 % CI 1. 07 - 3. 94). Both threatened abortions and exposure to <b>isoxsuprine</b> were associated only with nonatopic asthma. Conclusions: This study confirms that prenatal infective complications may contribute to the development of asthma in children and show a possible role for a new risk factor for asthma, that is exposure to <b>isoxsuprine.</b> Therefore, larger prospective studies, capable of separating atopic and nonatopic asthma, would serve to confirm these results and to explain the possible mechanism through which these factors may act...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 12 {{sympathomimetic}} amines was studied on the guinea pid tracheal chain preparation. All of the compounds, except methoxamine, produced some relaxation {{of the normal}} tracheal chain preparation and this relaxation was blocked by propranolol. For those compounds which had no hydroxyl groups in their structure this relaxation was due to release of noradrenaline since it was absent on preparations from reserpinized animals. Compounds {{with two or three}} hydroxyl groups had potent activity directly on β-receptors. As the concentration of amine was increased contractions of the trachea were observed with all of the compounds except ethylnoradrenaline, corbasil, nylidrin and <b>isoxsuprine.</b> These contractions were antagonized by α-receptor blocking drugs. Another type of relaxation which was not blocked by propranolol was observed with most of the drugs at still higher concentrations. There was considerable overlap in the concentration ranges producing these three types of response. Ephedrine, methoxamine and methoxyphenamine were found to possess β-receptor blocking activity...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{accurate}} and highly sensitive spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} ritodrine hydrochloride (RTH), pentazocine hydrochloride (PZH), <b>isoxsuprine</b> hydrochloride (ISH) and amoxicillin (AMX) is described. The method {{is based on the}} oxidation of the studied drugs by a known excess of chloramine – T (CAT) in hydrochloric acid medium and subsequent determination of the unreacted oxidant by reacting it with iodide in the same acid medium liberates iodine, which subsequently react with starch to form a stable starch-iodine complex. The reacted oxidant corresponds to the drug content. The coloured complex exhibits a maximum absorption at 590 nm. The apparent molar absorptivity values and Sandell’s sensitivity values are in the range 6. 96 x 104 - 1. 43 x 105 L mol– 1 cm– 1 and 2. 45 - 4. 30 ng cm– 2, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the studied drugs in their dosage forms. The results are reproducible within ± 1 % and compare favorably with those of official methods of British Pharmacopoeia and the United States Pharmacopoeia...|$|E
40|$|Oxytocin, {{elevated}} estrogen-progesterone ratio, fetal corticosteroids, prostaglandins, catecholamines, {{and changes}} in uterine blood flow have all been implicated as triggers of labor. In approximately one-third of cases of threatened premature labor contractions stop spontaneously. Thus placebo-controlled randomized trials of any new drug for inhibition of premature labor are necessary, as the spontaneous cessation of contractions always favors the claimed therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol inhibits the release of endogenous oxytocin and has an additional direct effect on the myometrium. In one study alcohol was more effective than placebo in the postponement of delivery. <b>Isoxsuprine,</b> ritodrine, and terbutaline have {{also been shown to}} be better than placebo in the inhibition of premature labor, and the beta adrenergic agents appear to be more effective than alcohol. Prostaglandin inhibitors such as indomethacin are currently under investigation. Success is correlated with early administration of the therapy, which requires treating some patients whose contractions might have stopped spontaneoulsy. As different factors may be involved in triggering premature labor, if one therapeutic approach fails another should be initiated promptly...|$|E
40|$|Background- Pregnancy {{represents}} a special physiological state {{during which the}} use of drug is of growing concern due to risk of teratogenicity with drugs. Most studies recently have reported increase in drug use in pregnancy. Objective- To study and to evaluate the pattern of drug use in women attending the antenatal clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology department at a tertiary care hospital Results- Out of 734 women, 94 % were 20 - 35 years of age. Common complaints were abdominal pain (13. 8 %), vomiting (12. 4 %), fever (7. 5 %) and others. Average number of drugs prescribed was 3. 01 and 86 % of women were prescribed 2 or more drugs. Iron preparations (78 %) and calcium carbonate (77 %), were the most frequently prescribed drugs followed by folic acid (46 %), <b>isoxsuprine</b> (24. 4 %) and others. Antibiotics were prescribed to 11. 2 %. The drugs belonging to essential drugs list were 59 % and 22 % of the drugs were prescribed by generic name. Out of 2208 drugs prescribed, 77. 5 % were FDA drug ris...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study the effect of critical formulation parameters affecting release of <b>isoxsuprine</b> hydrochloride from matrix tablets using combination of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and dicalcium phosphate (DCP). The powder blend consisting of drug and excipients was analyzed for angle of repose, Carr’s index and Hausner’s ratio. The tablets were prepared by direct compression method. To assess the compressional behavior of the drug-excipient blend, the tablets were analyzed for friability and crushing strength. The in vitro drug release study {{was carried out in}} distilled water. The powder blend exhibited satisfactorily flow as measured by angle of repose, Carr’s index and Hausner’s ratio. The formulation ingredients showed satisfactory tableting properties (friability < 1 %, crushing strength ≥ 4 kgf). The drug release was modified on addition of PEO and DCP. Addition of 5 to 25 % DCP in the formulation of matrix tablets caused apparent difference in the drug dissolution in distilled water. However, the difference was insignificant as analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) an...|$|E
40|$|An 800 [*]kg Swiss cow, eighth months gravid, was {{presented}} for anaesthesia to repair metacarpal fracture. The cow was premedicated with intravenous <b>isoxsuprine,</b> butorphanol, ketoprofen, and xylazine IM and induced with ketamine and diazepam IV. In lateral recumbency, the trachea was intubated, and isoflurane in oxygen and air was administered. Despite a ring block with lidocaine, purposeful movement happened, and xylazine 0. 02 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 and ketamine 0. 6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 constant rate infusion was started. During anaesthesia, slight hypercapnia and hypoxaemia developed. Total time of xylazine and ketamine infusion was 3. 5 hours. Total anaesthesia time was 4. 5 hours. For recovery of anaesthesia, isoflurane was discontinued, and in sternal recumbency, the trachea was extubated when the cow swallowed. Paralysis {{of the left}} radial nerve occurred, and the cow was supported to stand up after 2 hours. The radial nerve paralysis resolved within three days. A healthy calf was born at term. This is the first paper that describes the successful use of adjunctive xylazine and ketamine infusion to isoflurane anaesthesia in a late-term gravid cow undergoing fracture repair during 4. 5 hours...|$|E
