5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying <b>import</b> <b>duties.</b> Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1775, the British had imposed {{taxes and}} <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> on the American colonies, {{to which the}} {{inhabitants}} objected since they lacked British Parliamentary representation. In response to the Boston Tea Party and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops {{under the command of}} General Thomas Gage were sent to occupy Boston and to pacify the restive Province of Massachusetts Bay. Parliament authorized Gage, among other actions, to disband the local provincial government (led by John Hancock and Samuel Adams). It was reformed into the Provincial Congress, and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies. Under the terms of the Boston Port Act, Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, Taiwan’s exports will be {{severely}} disadvantaged {{in regard to}} tariffs (Chinese National Federation of Industries 2015). Approximately 35 % of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector export products are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> in TPP member economies, with products liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> of more than 5 % representing approximately 13 % of Taiwan’s total exports. In the Chilean, Australian and Vietnamese markets, more than 60 % of Taiwan’s export product items are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty,</b> in most cases {{at a rate of}} 5 % or higher.

5|$|In {{the interim}} between the <b>Import</b> <b>Duties</b> Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt.|$|E
5|$|Molwyn Joseph is an Antiguan {{politician}} and Chairman of the Antigua Labour Party (ALP). First entering politics in 1984 {{when he was}} made a Minister without Portfolio {{in the government of}} Vere Bird, Joseph became Minister of Finance seven years later, renegotiating the Antiguan national debt and introducing fiscal reforms. After a 1996 scandal in which it was discovered he had used his position to import a 1930s Rolls Royce for a friend, bypassing normal <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and taxes, he was dismissed from the Bird administration, returning 14 months later to serve as Minister for Planning, Implementation and the Environment. Following the 1999 general election he became Minister of Heath and Social Improvement before being made Minister of Tourism and the Environment a few months later. As Minister, Joseph attempted to improve the perception of Antigua as a tourist destination and invest in the industry, spending 2 million US dollars increasing the number of hotel rooms on the island and providing money for both Air Jamaica and Air Luxor to provide flights to the island.|$|E

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct preshipment inspections of imports, generating independent data on the value and tariff classification of incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.

25|$|Another factor which {{continues}} to {{play a significant role}} in the sales of Proton cars is the National Automotive Policy (NAP), enforced by the Malaysian government in the interests of Proton, Perodua, Naza and foreign brands with manufacturing plants in Malaysia. Under the NAP, imported vehicles are subjected to varying degrees of import and excise duties depending on the vehicle's origin of manufacture and engine displacement, with excise duty imposed at 60 to 105 percent being the highest component in the duty structure. Vehicles imported from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are subject to the least <b>import</b> <b>duties,</b> whereas those from Europe suffer the worst. However, imported hybrid vehicles and cars purchased in duty-free Langkawi are exempted from the import and excise duties. The NAP ensures the survival of Proton and other Malaysian-made vehicles under a biased playing field in the Malaysian market. Nonetheless, the <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> of the NAP have been progressively revised and reduced in line with the eventual liberation of the market, but excise duties, the larger component of tariffs, continues to be high and opaquely applied, with non-tariff barriers effectively reducing the rate for Malaysian made vehicles. In March 2013, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia) announced that vehicles manufactured in Australia and Japan will face a gradual reduction of <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> in stages to zero by 2016. Proton however responded positively to the announcement, citing their recent positive developments such as the 5-star ANCAP safety recognition of the Proton Prevé as part of its commitment to progress.|$|E
