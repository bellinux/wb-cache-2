Maeser also participated in the Utah {{constitutional}} convention after Abraham Smoot's death in 1895. He proposed an article to support prohibition, but later backed down.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time, Dunderdale {{was named}} the best fiscal {{performer}} of Canada's premiers by the Fraser Institute. The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E

During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> period, Osborn {{may or may not}} have been responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|The British Antarctic Survey {{deployed}} a small team of four (Dr Andrew Smith, Gabriel Chevailler, Ashly Fusiarski, Ian Hey) {{during the}} 2011-12 summer field season {{to carry out}} a series of seismic and radar surveys on PIG. They also installed a series of overwintering GPS stations. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> field season, a separate BAS team (Dr Mark Clilverd, Tom Stroud) was inputted to the field parties location and they installed an overwintering autonomous VLF station. This was followed by a radar traverse upstream using skidoos. This survey linked previous radar lines.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
50|$|Travis Ian Fox {{was born}} June 27, 1979 in Washington D.C. to working class parents. He has two older sisters. In his parents spare time they started and played in several bands which {{performed}} top 40 music. His {{mother was the}} lead singer and his father the manager. It was at this time TFOX was exposed to several genres of music. Before he could read or write, TFOX learned to play drums and {{by the age of}} 7, he would fill in <b>during</b> rehearsals. At <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time the advent of MTV swept the nation and groups like A-Ha, Human League, Spandau Ballet, and The Clash curiously caught TFOX’s attention.|$|R

5|$|Three days later, on 15 August, the Japanese Emperor Hirohito {{publicly}} announced Japan's unconditional surrender, effectively {{bringing about}} {{an end to}} the war. On 18 August, in the southern sector of the island the Japanese commander, General Masatane Kanda, dispatched an envoy across the flood swollen Mivo River to begin negotiations with the Australians for the surrender of the over 23,000 Japanese soldiers left on the island, bringing about {{an end to the}} campaign. Throughout the course of the fighting on Bougainville from November 1944 to August 1945, 526 Australians were killed, while a further 1,572 were wounded. Approximately 8,500 Japanese were killed in action and a further 9,800 died from disease <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> period.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

500|$|When {{completed}} in 1915, Fusō had two [...] and two [...] rangefinders in her forward superstructure, a [...] rangefinder {{on the roof}} of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5. In late 1917 a fire-control director was installed on a platform on the foremast. The 4.5-meter rangefinders were replaced by [...] instruments in 1923. During the ship's first modernization, four directors for the 12.7mm AA guns were added, one each {{on each side of the}} fore and aft superstructures, and an eight-meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast. This was replaced by a [...] rangefinder <b>during</b> 1938. At <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time, the two 3.5-meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25mm AA guns.

40|$|Delayed graft {{function}} (DGF) in kidney transplantation {{is associated}} with an increased risk of acute rejection. Myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in graft rejection, whereas plasmacytoid DCs {{may play a role in}} inducing tolerance. We evaluated the presence and phenotype of the DCs in renal graft biopsies of 15 patients with DGF collected before and 7 - 15 days after transplantation. Biopsies taken from normal patients and from transplant recipients with acute calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) nephrotoxicity served as a control group. Specific markers of myeloid, plasmacytoid, and mature DCs were imaged by confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. In normal kidneys and pre-transplant biopsies, sparse niches of myeloid and plasmacytoid cells were found but these were significantly increased with few mature cells <b>during</b> DGF. <b>This</b> <b>same</b> pattern was seen in acute rejection but with overall higher cell numbers. In CNI nephrotoxicity, myeloid cells were slightly increased but plasmacytoid cells were significantly higher than in DGF. Using a pig model, we found that a short period of warm ischemia followed by reperfusion led to myeloid cell infiltration of the kidney. Our data suggest that ischemia-reperfusion injury may cause an imbalance between intragraft myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs, which might be related to DGF and acute rejection...|$|R
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Poitous {{developed}} in the French Poitou region, possibly from donkeys introduced to the area by the Romans. They {{may have been a}} status symbol during the Middle Ages, and by the early 18th century, their physical characteristics had been established. A studbook for the breed was established in France in 1884, and the 19th and early 20th centuries saw them being used for the production of mules throughout Europe. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time, Poitou bloodlines were also used to develop other donkey breeds, including the American Mammoth Jack in the United States. Increasing mechanization in the mid-20th century saw a decline in the need for, and hence population of, the breed, and by 1977, a survey found only 44 members worldwide. Conservation efforts were begun by a number of public and private breeders and organizations, and by 2005 there were 450 purebred Poitou donkeys.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{cultivation}} {{spread to}} Japan around 300 CE, and, by 522 CE, the Byzantines managed to obtain silkworm eggs {{and were able}} to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>same</b> time. As a result of the spread of sericulture, Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market. The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing. During the 16th century France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.|$|E
