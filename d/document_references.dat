Though the report listed students as the largest portion of the arrests, individuals such as university professors,journalists and physicians were also detained. The methods for torture included the subject being stripped naked and either subjected to darkness, sound-based, temperature or electrical torture and other methods like hanging the subject by their arms and legs. Though the <b>document</b> <b>references</b> trials by military tribunals and arrests made {{by members of the}} military, the document also makes note of the use of the Brazilian police in the interrogation and torture process. Individuals labeled as hardened terrorists or known radical subversives usually faced an expedited execution process. A common practice for executions was to utilize a technique known as “the shootout technique”, in which the executed subject was deemed to have died in a “shootout” with the police.|$|E

5000|$|The Kairos {{document}} {{is a call}} from Palestinian Christian leaders for peaceful co-existence in the Holy Land, beginning with a re-negotiation of rights in Jerusalem for “two peoples” and “three religions.” The document’s theology begins with an insistence on God’s love for all people and for Christian love for others, which sometimes requires strong action. The Kairos Document argues against theologians who use the Bible to justify a religious state in the Holy Land, where Palestinian Christians and Muslims have a “natural right” to live. The authors place their hope for peace in God rather than political action, saying “resistance with love” is “a right and a duty for the Christian.” The <b>document</b> <b>references</b> the Apostle Paul’s statement to not resist evil with evil, but it stops short of condemning terrorism, calling instead for a removal of the “roots of ‘terrorism’” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{temporal}} locality characteristics {{present in}} document referencing behavior at Web proxies, {{and the impact}} of this temporal locality on document caching. First, drift measures are developed to characterize how the popularity profile of "hot" documents changes on a day-to-day basis. Experiments show that although there is considerable "hot set" drift, there is also a significant number of documents that have long-term popularity. Second, a measure of short-term temporal locality is developed that characterizes the relationship between recent past and near future <b>document</b> <b>references.</b> Using this measure, it is established that temporal locality arising out of the correlations between <b>document</b> <b>references</b> in the recent past and near future does exist for popular documents. Another objective {{of this paper is to}} determine whether or not Web <b>document</b> <b>references</b> at proxy caches can be modeled as independent and identically distributed random events.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We did {{formative}} {{evaluations of}} several variations to the computation of related articles for non-bibliographic {{resources in the}} medical domain. METHODS: A binary model and several variations of the vector space model were used to measure similarity between documents. Two corpora were studied, using a human expert as the gold standard. RESULTS: Variations in term weights and stopword choices made little difference to performance. Performance was worse when documents were characterized by title words alone or by MeSH terms extracted from <b>document</b> <b>references.</b> DISCUSSION: Further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate these methods in medical information retrieval systems...|$|E
