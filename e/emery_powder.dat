60|$|I {{examined}} it once {{more at the}} light with the lens. A longitudinal groove, apparently ground into {{one side of the}} needle, lengthwise, by means of a small grinding-stone and <b>emery</b> <b>powder,</b> ran for a quarter of an inch above the point. This groove seemed to me to have been produced by an amateur, though he must have been one accustomed to delicate microscopic manipulation; for the edges under the lens showed slightly rough, like the surface of a file on a small scale: not smooth and polished, as a needle-maker would have left them. I said so to Hilda.|$|E
5000|$|By way of example, a {{piece of}} lead {{may be used as}} the lap, charged with emery, and used to cut {{a piece of}} {{hardened}} steel. The small plate shown in the first picture is a hand lapping plate. That particular plate is made of cast iron. In use, a slurry of <b>emery</b> <b>powder</b> would be spread on the plate and the workpiece simply rubbed against the plate, usually in a [...] "figure-eight" [...] pattern.|$|E
5000|$|We see for {{the first}} time in al-Jazari's work several {{concepts}} important for both design and construction: the lamination of timber to minimize warping, the static balancing of wheels, the use of wooden templates (a kind of pattern), the use of paper models to establish designs, the calibration of orifices, the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with <b>emery</b> <b>powder</b> to obtain a watertight fit, and the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand.|$|E
50|$|Philadelphia's University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology {{displays}} {{the third largest}} crystal ball as the central object in its Chinese Rotunda. Weighing 55 pounds, the sphere is made of quartz crystal from Burma and was shaped through years of constant rotation in a semi-cylindrical container filled with <b>emery,</b> garnet <b>powder,</b> and water. The ornamental treasure was purportedly made for the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) during the Qing dynasty in the 19th century, but no evidence as to its actual origins exists. In 1988, the crystal ball and an ancient Egyptian statuette, which depicted the god Osiris were stolen from the Penn Museum, but were recovered three years later with no damage done to either object.|$|R
50|$|One popular design—a tomato with a {{strawberry}} attached—was most likely introduced during the Victorian Era. According to folklore, placing a tomato {{on the mantel}} of a new house guaranteed prosperity and repelled evil spirits. If tomatoes were out of season, families improvised by using a round ball of red fabric filled with sand or sawdust. The good-luck symbol also served a practical purpose—a place to store pins. Typically, the tomato was filled with cotton, wool, horsehair, or sawdust and the strawberry with <b>emery</b> <b>powder,</b> an abrasive to clean and sharpen the pins.|$|E
5000|$|Glass {{engraving}} {{encompasses a}} variety of techniques. One notable form is intaglio work, with images and inscriptions cut into {{the surface of the}} glass through abrasion. Glass engraving tools are therefore small abrasive wheels and drills, with small lathes often used. Engraving wheels are traditionally made of copper, with a linseed oil and fine <b>emery</b> <b>powder</b> mixture used as an abrasive.Other forms of engraving are [...] "stipple" [...] and [...] "drypoint" [...] in which the surface of the glass is abraded with the use of small diamond tipped burrs. The scratches and small dots made in this method can, {{in the hands of a}} skilled artist, be used to produce images of astonishing clarity and detail. Notable practitioners of this form are James Dennison Pender and the late Lawrence Whistler who began a revival in England.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} with the purpose to explore a {{certain aspects of the}} metabolism of bacteria by cell-free extracts. First of all a series of experiments have been carried out in order to obtain cell-free extracts of B. typhosa, S(57) S, that have respiratory activity; and the following results have been obtained. 1. Cell-free extracts prepared by ultrasonic and freezing-thawing method have been found to possess low respiratory activity on one or two substrates. 2, No set rules of destruction can be derived from the study of electron-micrographs of B. typhosa, S(57) S, destroyed by ultrasonic radiation and freezing-thawing processes. 3. Cell free extract of B. typhosa prepared by grinding with <b>emery</b> <b>powder</b> has been found to possess strong respiratory activity on lactate, succinate and fumarate...|$|E
40|$|With {{very few}} {{additional}} assumptions the wave equations for First Sound and Second Sound in liquid helium admit of simultaneous {{solution for the}} motion of both superfluid and normal fluid {{in the presence of}} a large viscous force on the normal fluid. If these fluids are set in motion by the presence of heat energy their consequent motion, through a viscous medium, is a mixture of two modes - a diffusive heat flow and a wave heat flow. These experiments aim at seeking each of these modes and examining them. It was found that the only observable heat was transmitted diffusively although a very high degree of experimental sensitivity to waves was reached. The investigation includes heat transmission by both pulses and monochromatic waves and the viscous medium varies from coarse <b>emery</b> <b>powder</b> to very tightly packed rouge. The measurements were carried out at temperatures from 1. 3 °K to the lambda point. The consequences of the absence of waves are analyzed. ...|$|E

40|$|Following up the {{previous}} experiments, {{with the use}} of extracts and acetone powder prepared from several strains of B. dysenteriae such as SM-resistant strain and SM-susceptible strain of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, this study has been conducted in order to consider some aspects of their metabolism. The results are as follows: 1. It has been possible to obtain cell-free extracts from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ by grinding with <b>emery</b> <b>powder,</b> the extracts containing oxidases of lactate, succinate, and glycine; and also the same three oxidases have been obtained from the acetone-powder prepared from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ. Moreover, the characteristics of those oxidases obtained by the above two methods are exactly the same. 2. No marked difference can be observed in the properties of these three oxidases contained in extract from SM-resistant strain or in those from SM-susceptible strain, of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, but there is a quantitative difference in oxygen uptake: namely, in SM-resistant strain oxygen uptake on three substrates per hour per mg of N is greater than the same in the case of SM-susceptible strain. 3. It has been confirmed that the properties of three oxidases of this bacillus, namely, oxidases of lactate, succinate, and glycine, are quite similar to the properties of those oxidases found in animals, plants, and bacteria. 4. Glycine oxidase has been extractable only from animal tissues and from and from a few kinds of bacteria, and the one that has been extracted from this bacillus possesses somewhat similar properties as those of animal tissues and other bacteria in that it is not affected by inhibitory agents of the cytochrome system and possesses a relatively narrow pH range of activity. It has been proven that glycine oxidase prepared from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ is a flavoprotein which produces glyoxylic acid and NH(3) by oxidative deamination of glycine. 5. Inhibitory action of malonate can not at all be seen on succinoxidase in resting cells of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, while this inhibitory action is observable {{in the case of the}} acetone powder and cell-free extracts of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ. This phenomena seem to be possibly brought about by permeability of the cell membrane...|$|E
