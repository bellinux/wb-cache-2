5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne <b>départment</b> <b>that</b> were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo {{proposed}} {{a measure that}} would require every Maryland police <b>department</b> <b>that</b> operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including where {{and when it was}} deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{opposed the}} {{building}} of the hydrogen bomb and the rearmament of Germany, which were policies encouraged by the assumptions of NSC-68. During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating in the State <b>Department</b> <b>that</b> plans were being made to advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson's goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, an {{official}} from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities {{believed that it}} would have compromised a larger investigation.

5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship to operate with his division. Specifically, Rodman requested the ship be New Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding. Although there was some grumbling at the Navy <b>Department</b> <b>that</b> a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|As far as {{the killing}} of Jewish women and {{children}} is concerned, Meyszner's direct involvement is less clear. According to Moll, Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner. Manoschek accepts Schäfer's assertion, stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command, over which Meyszner had very limited control. Despite this, as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates, including the Gestapo <b>department</b> <b>that</b> killed the Jewish women and children. He was also responsible for carrying out policies that saw 70,000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers, 4,000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway. The Holocaust in Serbia played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946. On 22 December, {{he was sentenced to}} death, along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time. On 24 January 1947, Meyszner was executed by hanging.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} season since Big Brother 6, {{the program was}} filmed at CBS Studios in Studio City, California. The {{production}} team was located in the second story of the House which included the story department, audio department and the switchers and shaders. The House was equipped with 52 cameras and 80 microphones to record the participants. The art <b>department</b> <b>that</b> created the competitions for the program was located outside the House. The House theme was eco-friendly and modern California living was released on June 29 during media day, where select {{members of the press}} were invited to spend 12 hours inside the House. Official pictures of the House interior were released by CBS on the same day, showing the living room, bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, lounge room and backyard. The living room featured chipboard walls with fake plants along the side.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice <b>Department,</b> <b>that</b> the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire {{is home to}} {{the public}} Adlai E. Stevenson High School and to the schools that compose the {{elementary}} Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. It serves as the headquarters for corporations including the global outsourcing company Aon Hewitt, and was the base of operations for the Newman/Haas Racing team. The village of Lincolnshire hosts several annual festivals (including one mirroring the Taste of Chicago) in either commercial establishments such as City Park or the Village Green, or in one of its nine public parks. The village maintains a police <b>department</b> <b>that</b> closely collaborates with its local school districts. Lincolnshire manages a public works system at the direct expense of the village; it retrieves all of its water from the city of Highland Park, which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan. The village has a council–manager government and is a home-rule municipality. The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth J. Brandt.|$|E
5|$|Three bills {{directing}} {{that the}} battleships be sold were {{introduced into the}} Argentine National Congress {{in the summer of}} 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State <b>Department</b> <b>that</b> Britain's Royal Navy was going to take over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country (as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany). Italy, the Ottomans, and Greece were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro. The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign competitor, put diplomatic pressure on Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was named}} Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The {{appointment}} {{was made by}} the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal <b>department</b> <b>that</b> was part of the royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office controlled access to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter Rolls in 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs de cursu. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.|$|E
