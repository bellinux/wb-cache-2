5|$|The diet of the pelagic {{stingray}} consists of free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{is an active}} hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and {{has been known to}} take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short gestation period of 24 months, females may bear two litters of 413 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> near the equator, {{with the exception of the}} Mediterranean Sea, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by fishery workers, the {{pelagic stingray}} can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks). Along with the pelagic stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as of Least Concern.|$|E

25|$|Wool may be spun {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause felting. When done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> with dish-soap.|$|E

25|$|Anadromous salmon are Northern Hemisphere {{fish that}} spend their ocean phase {{in either the}} Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean. They do not thrive <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water.</b> There is only one species of salmon found in the Atlantic, {{commonly}} called the Atlantic salmon. These salmon run up rivers {{on both sides of}} the ocean. Seven different species of salmon inhabit the Pacific (see table), and these are collectively referred to as Pacific salmon. Five of these species run up rivers {{on both sides of the}} Pacific, but two species are found only on the Asian side. In the early 19th century, Chinook salmon were successfully established in the Southern Hemisphere, far from their native range, in New Zealand rivers. Attempts to establish anadromous salmon elsewhere have not succeeded.|$|E
25|$|Veneralia (April 1) {{was held}} in honour of Venus Verticordia ("Venus the Changer of Hearts"), and Fortuna Virilis (Virile or strong Good Fortune), whose cult was {{probably}} by far the older of the two. Venus Verticordia was invented in 220 BC, in response to advice from a Sibylline oracle during Rome's Punic Wars, when a series of prodigies was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three Vestal Virgins. Her statue was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most pudica (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of Fortuna Virilis, perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC Venus Verticordia was given her own temple. She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and morality known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For Ovid, Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented {{a change of heart}} in the goddess herself.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} effects of ocean warming on marine predators are largely unknown, though {{the impact on}} the distribution of prey in vertical space may have far reaching impacts on diving predators such as southern elephant seals. We used data from satellite-tracked southern elephant seals from Marion Island to investigate the relationship between their dive characteristics (dive depths, dive durations and time-at-depth index values) and environmental variables (temperature at depth, depth of maximum temperature below 100 m, frontal zone and bathymetry) as well as other demographic and behavioural variables (migration stage, age-class, track day and vertical diel strategy). While other variables, such as bathymetry and vertical diel strategy also influenced dive depth, our results consistently indicated a significant influence of temperature at depth on dive depths. This relationship was positive for all groups of animals, indicating that seals dived to deeper depths when foraging <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>waters.</b> Female seals adjusted their dive depths proportionally more than males <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>water.</b> Dive durations were also influenced by temperature at depth, though to a lesser extent. Results from time-at-depth indices showed that both male and female seals spent less time at targeted dive depths <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>water,</b> and were presumably less successful foragers when diving <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>water.</b> Continued <b>warming</b> of the Southern Ocean may result in the distribution of prey for southern elephant seals shifting either poleward and/or to increasing depths. Marion Island elephant seals are expected to adapt their ranging and diving behaviour accordingly, though such changes may result in greater physiological costs associated with foraging...|$|R
2500|$|Cement sets when {{mixed with}} water {{by way of}} a complex series of {{chemical}} reactions still only partly understood.

2500|$|With {{the entire}} island {{south of the}} Tropic of Cancer, the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The {{temperature}} is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is [...] in January and [...] in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea {{and the fact that}} Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes. These are most common in September and October.|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast {{first in a}} dried or [...] "inactive" [...] state and is [...] reactivated <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> or diluted grape juice prior to being added to the must. To thrive and be active in fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus as well as access to various vitamins and minerals. These components are naturally present in the grape must but their amount may be corrected by adding nutrients to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for the yeast. Newly formulated time-release nutrients, specifically manufactured for wine fermentations, offer the most advantageous conditions for yeast. Oxygen is needed as well, but in wine making, the risk of oxidation {{and the lack of}} alcohol production from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at a minimum.|$|E

2500|$|Urea {{was first}} noticed by Hermann Boerhaave {{in the early}} 18th century from evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle {{obtained}} crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term [...] "urea." [...] Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> and barium carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and evaporated, leaving pure urea.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Cancer Institute, the {{aluminium}} acetates {{are used}} topically in humans as antiseptic agents, which also cause body tissues to shrink. [...] Its astringency property {{is also used}} for treating Mortellaro disease in hoofed animals such as cattle. [...] Aluminium acetate promotes healing of infected skin and also assists with inflammation, itching, and stinging. [...] The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for use for [...] "temporary relief of minor skin irritations due to ... 'poison ivy,' 'poison oak,' 'poison sumac,' 'insect bites,' 'athlete's foot,' or 'rashes caused by soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry.'" [...] For these applications, over-the-counter preparations such as Burow's solution are typically used, while diluted forms are used as gargles for conditions like aphthous ulcers of the mouth, including with amino acid additives to improve palatability and taste. [...] The most common use of Burow's solution is in treating ear infections including otomycosis, though it is generally not as effective as clotrimazole in these fungal infections. [...] Topical astringent powder Domeboro contains aluminium sulfate tetradecahydrate, , and calcium acetate monohydrate, , and forms an aluminium acetate solution similar to Burow's solution when dissolved. [...] Domeboro solutions <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> {{can be used in}} cases of ingrown toenails, to reduce irritation and contain any infection which might be present.|$|E
2500|$|Semi-dry {{suits are}} {{effectively}} a thick wetsuit with nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used {{where the water}} temperature is between [...] The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals [...] Two-piece sets {{tend to be a}} one piece full length suit, sometimes described as [...] "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.|$|E
