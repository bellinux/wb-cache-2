50|$|Cyanide, a {{substance}} of sanitary concern, is only due {{to use and}} discharge of the industrial sector. Cyanide has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following cyanide exposure depends {{in part on the}} form of cyanide, such as hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas</b> or <b>cyanide</b> salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high. Cyanide has been a major component of metal-plating solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.|$|R

50|$|Since {{sterilant}} gases {{are selected}} {{to destroy a}} wide range of biological life forms, any gas which is suitable for sterilization will present a hazard to personnel exposed to it. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health values (IDLH) for the three sterilant gases above are 800 ppm, 75 ppm and 5 ppm for ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide and ozone respectively. For comparison, the IDLH of <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas</b> (hydrogen <b>cyanide)</b> is 50 ppm.

50|$|The most {{hazardous}} compound is hydrogen cyanide, {{which is}} a gas at ambient temperatures and pressure and can therefore be inhaled. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide.

40|$|We {{describe}} an inexpensive paper-based sensor for rapid detection of low concentrations (ppm) of hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas.</b> A piece of filter paper pre-spotted with a dilute monocyanocobinamide [CN(H 2 O) Cbi] solution {{was placed on}} the end of a bifurcated optical fiber and the reflectance spectrum of the CN(H 2 O) Cbi was monitored during exposure to 1. 0 - 10. 0 ppm hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas.</b> Formation of dicyanocobinamide yielded a peak at 583 nm with a simultaneous decrease in reflectance from 450 - 500 nm. Spectral changes were monitored as a function of time at several relative humidity values: 25, 50, and 85 % relative humidity. With either cellulose or glass fiber papers, spectral changes occurred within 10 s of exposure to 5. 0 ppm hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas</b> (NIOSH recommended short-term exposure limit). We conclude that this sensor could provide a real-time end-of-service-life alert to a respirator user.

500|$|Assessing {{the hazard}} {{associated}} with an acid or base may require a knowledge of pKa values. For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic <b>gas,</b> because the <b>cyanide</b> ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a pKa of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is [...] "fully dissociated" [...] so the hazard due to the hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>gas</b> is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.|$|R
