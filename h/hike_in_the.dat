5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ticket prices or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Nav Nirman agitation– {{a protest}} against a 20% <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad– snowballed into a {{movement}} to remove Chimanbhai Patel, then chief minister of Gujarat. In the 1980s, a reservation policy {{was introduced in the}} country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes. The city suffered some {{of the impact of the}} 2001 Gujarat earthquake; up to 50 multi-storey buildings collapsed, killing 752 people and causing much damage. The following year, a three-day period of violence between Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots, spread to Ahmedabad; refugee camps were set up around the city.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a <b>hike</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|In 1953 the LSSP {{took the}} lead in organising the Hartal.

Jayawardena was the finance minister of the country. Maintaining the price of rice at 25 cent had been an electoral promise given by UNP in the 1952 elections, and when the new rates were introduced to the public there was a massive anger against it. Other harsh ingredients of the 1953 budget included suspension of the meals given to schoolchildren and hikes in rail ticket fares and postal fees.|$|E

500|$|There are 24 named waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park in the U.S. {{state of}} Pennsylvania along Kitchen Creek as it flows in three steep, narrow valleys, or glens. They range in height from 9feet (2.7m) to the 94-foot (29m) Ganoga Falls. Ricketts Glen State Park {{is named for}} R. Bruce Ricketts, a colonel in the American Civil War who owned over 80,000acres (32,000ha) {{in the area in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but spared the old-growth forests in the glens from clearcutting. The park, which opened in 1944, is {{administered}} by the Bureau of State Parks of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR). Nearly all of the waterfalls are visible from the Falls Trail, which Ricketts had built from 1889 to 1893 and which the state park rebuilt in the 1940s and late 1990s.

500|$|In 1969 the Glens Natural Area {{was named}} a National Natural Landmark, {{and it became a}} Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which {{guarantees}} it [...] "will be protected and maintained in a natural state". In 1996 heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped 36-foot (11m) poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997. In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time. That same year local fire companies trained to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them treacherous. In 1998 a four-year project to [...] "repair and improve the Falls Trail" [...] began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, reduce erosion, and repair some bridges.
