40|$|Abstract—Testing {{security}} systems is challenging because a system’s authors {{have to play}} the double role of attackers and defenders. Red Team/Blue Team exercises are an invaluable mechanism for security testing. They partition researchers into two competing teams of attackers and defenders, enabling them to create challenging and realistic test scenarios. While such exercises provide valuable insight into the vulnerabilities of {{security systems}}, they are very expensive and thus rarely performed. In this paper, we describe a Red Team/Blue Team <b>exercise,</b> <b>sponsored</b> by DARPA’s FTN program, and performed October 2002 to May 2003. The goal of the exercise was to evaluate a collaborative DDoS defense, comprised of a distributed system, COSSACK, and a stand-alone defense, D-WARD. The role of the Blue Team was played by developers of the tested systems from USC/ISI and UCLA, the Red Team included researchers from Sandia National Laboratories, and all of the coordination, experiment execution, result collection, and analysis were performed by the White Team from BBN Technologies. This exercise was of immense value to all involved—it uncovered significant vulnerabilities in tested systems, pointed out desirable characteristics in DDoS defense systems (e. g., avoiding reliance on timing mechanisms), and taught us many lessons about testing of DDoS defenses.

The articles published in December 2011 look at the future of homeland security and suggest a new method for assessing past effectiveness. Rapid advances in technology have created a highly disruptive environment for homeland security, empowering small groups or individuals in new and unpredictable ways. Responding to the power of these “few,” argues Rodrigo Nieto-Gómez, requires new organizational approaches. One such approach may be to divide the homeland security enterprise into two distinct missions: the current systemic mission and a separate, disruptive (future shock) mission modeled on the efforts of DARPA.

40|$|International audienceA {{simple and}} rapid method has been {{developed}} to determine methylmercury in sediments. The procedure {{is based on the}} quantitative microwave-assisted leaching of methylmercury from sediments with an acidic extradant. Sample preparation is achieved in an open focused microwave field by heating about 1 g of dry sediment suspended into 10 ml of 2 mol l- 1 HNO 3 during 3 - 4 min at a power of 40 - 60 W. The extracted mercury compounds are ethylated, cryogenically trapped in a chromatographic phase, successively eluted and detected in an electrothermally heated quartz furnace by CV AAS. The method has been validated by the analysis of the certified IAEA- 356 and CRM 580 reference materials and one sediment sample, BCR S 19, from an intercomparison study within the framework of a certification <b>exercise</b> <b>sponsored</b> by the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) of the European Commission. The detection limit of the procedure is 0. 5 ng of methylmercury per gram of dry sediment. After analysis of the sediments mentioned above (methylmercury ranging from 5 to 80 ng g- 1), a mean methylmercury recovery of 97 % and an RSD of 7 % were obtained. Under optimum conditions, sample throughput is restricted by the instrumental analysis time (about 20 min per sample), rather than by the sample preparation step. In addition, the methylmercury extraction efficiency of four different acids, nitric, hydrochloric, sulfuric and acetic acid, has been investigated for comparison. Results on the behaviour and stability of methylmercury in a microwave field are also provided...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{underground}} repositories to storage high level radioactive waste {{is based on}} the multi barrier concept that consists of placing natural and artificial barriers around the radioactive material for isolation. The artificial barrier is commonly made of expansive clay (e. g. bentonite) that is subjected to heating and hydration resulting in Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) coupled phenomena. Experimental evidence has shown an important reduction in the hydration rate of the clay at advanced stages of infiltration tests under non-isothermal conditions. Traditional models have had problems to properly reproduce the hydraulic behavior observed in some experiments, overestimating the hydration rate and underestimating the time required to reach fully saturation conditions. This thesis presents THM modeling of the FEBEX bentonite based on a mathematical framework suitable for problems in low permeability media. In addition, phenomena not included in traditional models like the threshold hydraulic gradient, thermo-osmosis and double structure are incorporated in the proposed framework to explain the reduction in the hydration rate. In order to assess the performance of the models, infiltration laboratory tests performed under isothermal and non isothermal conditions and the mock-up large scale test carried out by CIEMAT, are presented. Additionally, a synthetic in-situ <b>exercise</b> <b>sponsored</b> by the eFEBEX project to study the THM evolution of a full scale bentonite buffer under typical repository conditions is also discussed. All numerical simulations were carried out with the finite element program CODE_BRIGHT and divided into four cases: a reference case, (based on the standard THM formulation) and the other three correspond to advance model incorporating the following phenomena: the threshold hydraulic gradient, thermo-osmosis and double structure effects. The models incorporated in the existing THM formulation enable the improvement of numerical predictions of the experimental data obtained from the infiltration tests and mock-up experiment by reproducing the reduction in the hydration rate inside the bentonite. It has been observed that the double structure model that considers the two dominant pore levels and material fabric changes in the FEBEX bentonite provided a more satisfactory reproduction of the long-term experimental results...|$|R
