5|$|The 1990s {{brought the}} {{beginnings}} of an economic turnaround for the city. Many renovations and building additions <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> revitalize downtown.

5|$|Many {{improvements}} <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the Route 3 freeway. In the 1970s, the interchanges with Route 17, the New Jersey Turnpike western spur, and Route 120 were {{improved with}} the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in the area. The bridge over the Berrys Creek, originally built in 1948, was reconstructed in the mid-1990s and Route 3 was widened to eight lanes in the area near the bridge. In 2003, the interchange with Route 495 and the intersection with U.S. Route 1/9 was improved at a cost of $16 million.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

5|$|Since 1953, {{many changes}} <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed {{on the road}} had been either {{modified}} or replaced by at-grade intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an at-grade intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, {{was replaced by the}} 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|E

25|$|SR 514 was {{designated}} on its present Danville–Shreve alignment in 1936. At {{the time of}} its designation, the entire route was paved with gravel. By 1955, its entire length was asphalt-paved. Since then, no changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the routing.|$|E

25|$|State Highway 128 first {{appears on}} the 1957 edition of the {{official}} Oklahoma state highway map. The route {{has always been a}} paved highway. Initially, it did not connect to Highway 28 upon crossing the Arkansas state line. The route was realigned to directly connect to Highway 28 by 1961. No further changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the highway since that time.|$|E
25|$|The current State Highway 1 was {{designated}} on February 5, 1968. The portion of highway between Haileyville and Talihina was made solely part of SH-1. This left SH-63 in two discontinuous sections, one between Kiowa and Haileyville {{and one from}} Talihina to the Arkansas line. This situation would persist for fifteen years. On July 7, 1983, SH-63 was restored between the two segments, forming the SH-1/63 concurrency. No further changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the highway since.|$|E

The King Street Metro station opened about three blocks from {{the memorial}} in November 1983. Storm windows on the exterior of building were also replaced about this time, {{at a cost of}} $75,000. Microwave transmission antennas were added {{to the top of the}} memorial in 1990 to help the City of Alexandria improve police radio transmissions in the area.|$|E
25|$|SR 729 {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1937 between {{what was then}} US 35 near Octa and Milledgevile (now the eastern terminus of SR 435) and its present northern terminus. In 1940, the route was extended south on a new alignment to Sabina and took over SR 350 from SR 73 to Sabina (SR 350 at that time ran east of SR 350 instead of ending in New Vienna as it does today). No major changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the routing since then.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E

25|$|Medieval writers often {{assumed that}} paganus as a {{religious}} term {{was a result of}} the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Romans during Early Christianity. Third, unlike words such as , paganus had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.|$|E
25|$|SR 651 {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1939, but was much longer {{at that time}} that its present routing. The 1939 route included all of the modern-day SR 651, but the route then headed east and later northeast out of Baltic on Tuscarawas County Road 52 to Ragersville. The route then followed County Road 52 east to what was then US 21 just southwest of New Philadelphia. The route between New Bedford and Baltic was a gravel road at its inception into the state highway system while most of the route between Baltic and New Philadelphia was paved. By 1942, the Baltic-New Philadelphia segment was downgraded to county roads leaving the current New Bedford-Baltic segment the only section of SR 651. No major changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the route since then.|$|E
25|$|Though {{within the}} same area of SR 212's current {{southern}} terminus, SR 212 was first designated in 1923 along a different route than where it travels today. The original 1923 route ran from the community of Station 15 (within Monroe Township, Harrison County) at SR 13 (modern-day US 250) to SR 151 in Bowerston. At this time, the only portion of modern-day SR 212 {{that was part of}} the state highway system was between Sherrodsville and Bowerston; this segment was signed as the westernmost portion of SR 151. In 1928, SR 151 and SR 212 switched routes, SR 212 now ran from Sherrodsville and Bowerston and SR 151 traveled west to Station 15. In 1939, SR 212 was extended north and west to Beach City along county routes and replacing all of SR 352 between Bolivar and US 250. Since then, no major changes <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the routing of SR 212.|$|E
