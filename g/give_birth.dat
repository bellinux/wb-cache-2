5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their birthing process.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to a litter {{of three or four}} kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|After women <b>give</b> <b>birth,</b> about 5% develop {{postpartum}} thyroiditis {{which can}} occur up {{to nine months}} afterwards. This {{is characterized by a}} short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20–40% remain permanently hypothyroid.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, three female {{chimpanzee}} {{arrived from}} Taronga Zoo, 11-year-old Cara, 9-year-old Samantha and 7-year-old Sally. Jodie <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to a son, Gombe, in 1993. In 1994, Cara <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to a daughter Chima, while Samantha <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to a son, Temba. In 1996, Sally <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> a son, Mahinga. In 1998, Samantha <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to a daughter Keza, while Cara <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> to a son, Alexis.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, {{making use of}} shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b> This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|Late in the {{dry season}} (around April) of each year, females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains {{attached}} to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.|$|E
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> {{to more than}} one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E

Animals that have <b>given</b> <b>birth</b> once are described as [...] "primiparous"; those that have <b>given</b> <b>birth</b> more than once are described as [...] "pluriparous".

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat is the {{smallest}} species of bat and arguably the world's smallest mammal. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, {{with an average of}} 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> annually to a single offspring.|$|E

5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> {{to up to}} four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} is aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained by a yolk sac until birth. In northern areas, females use bays and sloughs as nursery areas, while {{to the south}} they <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> in more open areas. Known breeding grounds {{along the coast of}} California include Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, San Francisco Bay, Elkhorn Slough, Morro Bay, Santa Monica Bay (Los Angeles), Catalina Harbor (Santa Catalina Island), and San Diego Bay.|$|E
