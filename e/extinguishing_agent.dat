40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} ecotoxicity of selected fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> concentrated on surface-active agents (surfactants) contained in foam fire extinguishers. Tested substances were solid humectants TS TURBO and TS ECO. In this bachelor thesis the ecotoxicological effects were assessed through aquatic ecotoxicity tests with an aquatic plant Lemna minor and a crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus. They are fresh-water organisms {{on which the}} water contamination can be quickly and quite easily assessed. Also these fire extinguishers were tested for acute ecotoxicity of soil organisms by ecotoxicological contact tests with Eisenia fetida and seeds of Lactuca sativa. Finally, the biodegradation of both fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> was tested, observing the change between 24 hour exposition and one month exposition of tested agents.

Based on experimental results of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> the value of LC 50 and IC 50 was calculated and the ecotoxicity was compared...|$|R
25|$|Potassium {{chloride}} {{was once}} {{used as a}} fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent,</b> used in portable and wheeled fire extinguishers. Known as Super-K dry chemical, it was more effective than sodium bicarbonate-based dry chemicals and was compatible with protein foam. This agent fell out of favor {{with the introduction of}} potassium bicarbonate (Purple-K) dry chemical in the late 1960s, which was much less corrosive and more effective. It is rated for B and C fires.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Germany {{invented the}} liquid {{chlorobromomethane}} (CBM) {{for use in}} aircraft. It was more effective and slightly less toxic than carbon tetrachloride and was used until 1969. Methyl bromide was discovered as an <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in the 1920s and was used extensively in Europe. It is a low-pressure gas that works by inhibiting the chain reaction of the fire and is the most toxic of the vaporizing liquids, used until the 1960s. The vapor and combustion by-products of all vaporizing liquids were highly toxic, and could cause death in confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance inspection: All {{types of}} {{extinguishers}} should be inspected {{at least once}} a year. The extinguisher is checked that it has the correct volume and pressure of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent,</b> that it is within the required hydrotest and internal maintenance intervals, that it is in good condition, and that all external parts are still serviceable. Dry chemical and dry powder types may also be hit on the bottom with a rubber mallet to make sure the powder is free-flowing. After inspection, the tech will attach a new tamper seal and yearly service tag around the pin.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent.</b> This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, dry chemical (classes ABC and B.C.), and dry powder (class D) types {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|Sodium forms {{flammable}} {{hydrogen and}} caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes {{in the presence}} of an oxidizer such as water. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. [...] An effective <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{the principal}} <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in fire extinguishers (Met-L-X, Super D) used on combustible metal fires such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, and NaK alloys (Class D). Thermoplastic powder {{is added to the}} mixture, along with waterproofing (metal stearates) and anti-caking materials (tricalcium phosphate) to form the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent.</b> When it is applied to the fire, the salt acts like a heat sink, dissipating heat from the fire, and also forms an oxygen-excluding crust to smother the fire. The plastic additive melts and helps the crust maintain its integrity until the burning metal cools below its ignition temperature. This type of extinguisher was invented in the late 1940s as a cartridge-operated unit, although stored pressure versions are now popular. Common sizes are [...] portable and [...] wheeled.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, as the Graviner Manufacturing Company in Gosport, it {{made the}} Graviner Extinguisher, an explosion-suppression system, which {{operated}} to prevent fuel from catching fire in an aircraft crash.

2500|$|According to the {{standard}} BS EN 3, fire extinguishers in the United Kingdom as all throughout Europe are red RAL 3000, and a band or circle of a second color covering between 5–10% of the surface area of the extinguisher indicates the contents.

2500|$|Fire {{extinguishing}} {{capacity is}} rated {{in accordance with}} ANSI/UL 711: Rating and Fire Testing of Fire Extinguishers. [...] The ratings are described using numbers preceding the class letter, such as 1-A:10-B:C. The number preceding the A multiplied by 1.25 gives the equivalent extinguishing capability in gallons of water. [...] The number preceding the B indicates the size of fire in square feet that an ordinary user {{should be able to}} extinguish. There is no additional rating for class C, as it only indicates that the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> will not conduct electricity, and an extinguisher will never have a rating of just C.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, another common fire {{extinguisher}} was a single-use, sealed glass globe known as a [...] "fire grenade," [...] filled with either carbon tetrachloride or salt water. The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire. [...] The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a solder-based restraint. [...] When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> to be automatically dispersed into the fire. [...] A well-known brand was the [...] "Red Comet," [...] which was variously manufactured with other fire-fighting equipment in the Denver, Colorado area by the Red Comet Manufacturing Company from its founding in 1919 until manufacturing operations were closed in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Most fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> pose a {{corrosion}} {{hazard to}} aircraft. The extinguishing effect of Halon is through interference of the thermal {{balance of the}} flame, and to a small extent by interfering with the chemical reaction of the fire. Halons are chlorofluorocarbons which cause damage to the ozone layer. It is being phased out for environmentally friendlier alternatives. However, most of these alternatives will not fit in an aircraft engine.|$|R

2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a portable fire extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the squeeze of a lever. A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|E

50|$|Brominated haloalkanes {{were first}} used during World War II as fire {{extinguisher}} for aircraft and tanks. Bromochlorodifluoromethane was introduced {{as an effective}} gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid 1960s for use around highly valuable materials {{in places such as}} museums, mainframe rooms and telecommunication switching centers. They were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.|$|E

Tire fi res can last months {{and in some cases}} years pol lut ing the air, soil, and water. There are several issues that make outdoor storage of tires prob lem at ic. The fi rst issue is the volume of tires that are generated every year — about 300 million na tion al ly. California’s com-muter culture generates 33. 3 million alone. With 280 million tires already stored in sites across Amer i ca, outdoor storage of scrap tires appears to be a waste management issue that the fi re service will be dealing with for a while. The second issue that adds to the tire storage problem is the tire’s geometry.
