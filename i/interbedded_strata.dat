40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of urban construction, the shield construction {{technology has been}} greatly developed. Shield tunneling method generally adapts to relatively uniform soil, soft rock and sand rock strata, and the shield tunnel construction has been more mature for the homogeneous strata. However, for the soft and hard <b>interbedded</b> <b>strata,</b> how {{to solve the problems}} of breaking the hard rock, increasing the tunneling efficiency and reducing the construction costs, are difficult problems in the shield tunnel construction. In this paper, based on a great deal of theoretical analyses and engineering practices, the effective methods of improving the efficiency of tunneling, reducing cutter wearing and decreasing the construction costs in the process of the shield tunneling construction in hard rock and gravel layer are proposed...|$|E
40|$|The National Coal Mining Museum in West Yorkshire affords a rare {{opportunity}} {{for the public to}} visit a former colliery (Caphouse) and experience at first hand the geology of a mine. The geology at the museum can be seen via the public tour, limited surface outcrop and an inclined ventilation drift, which provides the best geological exposure and information. The strata encountered at the site are c. 100 m thick and are of latest Langsettian (Pennsylvanian) age. The ventilation drift intersects several coal seams (Flockton Thick, Flockton Thin, Old Hards, Green Lane and New Hards) and their associated roof rocks and seatearths. In addition to exposures of bedrock, recent mineral precipitates of calcium carbonates, manganese carbonates and oxides, and iron oxyhydroxides can be observed along the drift, and there is a surface exposure of Flockton Thick Coal and overlying roof strata. The coals and <b>interbedded</b> <b>strata</b> were deposited in the Pennine Basin in a fluvio-lacustrine setting in an embayment distant from the open ocean with limited marine influence. A lacustrine origin for mudstone roof rocks of several of the seams is supported by the incidence of non-marine bivalves and fossilized fish remains whilst {{the upper part of the}} Flockton Thick Coal consists of subaqueously deposited cannel coal. The mudstones overlying the Flockton Thick containing abundant non-marine bivalves are of great lateral extent, indicating a basin-wide rise of base level following coal deposition that may be compared with a non-marine flooding surface...|$|E
40|$|The active {{plate margin}} of South America is {{characterized}} by a frequent occurrence of large and devastating subduction earthquakes. Here we focus on marine sedimentary records off Southern Chile that are archiving the regional paleoseismic history over the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. The investigated records - Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1232 and SONNE core 50 SL - are located at ~ 40 °S and ~ 38 °S, within the Perú-Chile trench, and are characterized by frequent <b>interbedded</b> <b>strata</b> of turbiditic and hemipelagic origin. On the basis of the sedimentological characteristics and the association with the active margin of Southern Chile, we assume that the turbidites are mainly seismically triggered, and may be considered as paleo-megaearthquake indicators. However, the long-term changes in turbidite recurrence times appear to be strongly influenced by climate and sea level changes as well. During sea level highstands in the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, recurrence times of turbiditic layers are substantially higher, primarily reflecting a climate-induced reduction of sediment availability and enhanced slope stability. In addition, segmented tectonic uplift changes and related drainage inversions likely influenced the postglacial decrease in turbidite frequencies. Glacial turbidite recurrence times (including MIS 2, MIS 3, cold substages of MIS 5, and MIS 6), on the other hand, are within the same order of magnitude as earthquake recurrence times derived from the historical record and other terrestrial paleoseismic archives of the region. Only during these cold stages sediment availability and slope instability were high enough to enable recording of the complete sequence of large earthquakes in Southern Chile. Our data thus suggest that earthquake recurrence times on the order of 100 to 200 years are a persistent feature at least during the last glacial period...|$|E

40|$|A 100 m high {{gravity dam}} (Castrovido dam, Burgos, Spain) {{is founded on}} a soft Weald red {{siltstone}} with <b>interbedded</b> sandstone <b>strata.</b> Dam stability is essentially controlled by the available shear strength of sedimentation planes. Block samples were recovered for {{the different types of}} contact identified. They were tested in high capacity shear box machine (30 x 30 cm) and in large scale shear tests. The roughness of the sheared plane was determined after each one of the tests. Additional information includes the results of residual strength tests performed on clay fillings on a ring shear apparatus. The results of all the tests performed are compared in the paper showing the effect of field surface roughness. The paper also discusses the procedure followed to select an appropriate strength envelope for design purposes on the basis of all the available information. The case points out the difficulty to select unambiguously a suitable design strength for the critical sedimentation surfaces despite the efforts displayed in the field and in the laboratory.

40|$|We present new geochemical and sedimentological {{data from}} {{marginal}} marine strata of Penarth Bay, south Wales (UK) to elucidate {{the origin of}} widespread but enigmatic concentrations of vertebrate hard parts (bonebeds) in marine successions of Rhaetian age (late Triassic). Sedimentological evidence shows that the phosphatic constituents of the bonebeds were subjected to intense phosphatization in shallow current-dominated settings and subsequently reworked and transported basinward by storms. <b>Interbedded</b> organic-rich <b>strata</b> deposited under quiescent and poorly oxygenated conditions record enhanced phosphorus regeneration from sedimentary organic matter into the water column and probably provided {{the main source of}} phosphate required for heavy bonebed clast phosphatization. The stratigraphically limited interval showing evidence for oxygen depletion and accelerated P-cycling coincides with a negative 4 % organic carbon isotope excursion, which possibly reflects supra-regional changes in carbon cycling and clearly predates the 'initial isotope excursion' characterizing many Triassic-Jurassic boundary strata. our data indicate that Rhaetian bonebeds are the lithological signature of profound, climatically driven changes in carbon cycling and redox conditions and support the idea of a multi-pulsed environmental crisis {{at the end of the}} Triassic, possibly linked to successive episodes of igneous activity in the central Atlantic Magmatic Province...|$|R
40|$|The lignite deposit at Pontokomi (Sector 6) in the Ptolemaida Basin of Greece was studied petrographically so {{that the}} {{conditions}} that prevailed in the paleo-environment could be analyzed. The above deposit is situated in the northwestern part of the broader basin of Ptolemaida in Macedonia, Greece. It consists of alternating beds of lignite and <b>interbedded</b> <b>strata.</b> The interburden is made of clay marls, occasionally enriched in sand. Thirty-seven samples of lignite were taken for analysis from two representative coreholes (Delta 3 and Delta 5) located in {{the central part of}} the lignite deposit. The study showed that macerals of the huminite group were dominant, followed by inertinite macerals. Liptinites made up a small percentage of the total population. Densinite, attrinite, eu-ulminite, corpohuminite and detrogelinite were the most abundant huminite group macerals, respectively. Inertodetrinite and fusinite were the dominant inertinite macerals, while sporinite and resinite were the predominant litpinite macerals. Mineral matter consisted mainly of clays, carbonates and pyrite. Detailed maceral analysis allowed us to obtain indices related to the wetness in the peat swamp (GI), degree of vegetation growth (VI), level of water table (GWI), and preservation of plant tissues (TPI). By comparing ratios of these indices and correlating them to ternary diagrams developed by different authors, we were able to obtain valuable information as to the conditions that dominated in the original peat swamp. The ratio of VI/GWI provided data on the hydrology and nutrient supply in the peat-forming environment, whereas the ratio of TPI/GI was used to interpret the paleo-environment in relation to the water table. Evaluation of the data showed that the environment that hosted the parent flora was limnic (open water) dominated by grasses and sedges under rheotrophic to mesotrophic nutrient supply conditions...|$|E
40|$|South Africa’s coal {{reserves}} {{have been}} significantly reduced since 2003 and a re-assessment {{based on the}} complete statistical history of production from southern Africa has indicated that the present remaining reserve for the entire subcontinent comprises only about 15 billion tonnes or gigatonnes (Gt). South African coal geologists should therefore be mindful of experience in Britain, where reserves were grossly overestimated by conventional techniques and remained a large multiple of future production until very shortly before the effective collapse of the industry in the 1980 s. The southern African historical analysis has shown that an impressive leap in coal production occurred between 1975 and 1985, from about 69 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr) to 179 Mt/yr. By 1989, the cumulative production had reached 4 Gt. Despite this doubling since to just over 8 Gt, the underlying pattern {{has been one of}} faltering growth. Hubbertarian analysis predicts a peak in production rate of about 284 Mt/yr in 2020, at which stage approximately half (12 Gt) of the total resource (23 Gt) will be exhausted. The Waterberg Coalfield (Ellisras Basin) in South Africa may be a remaining large resource, but structural complexity, finely <b>interbedded</b> coal-shale <b>strata</b> at large depths, low grades, high ash content and water scarcity are likely to inhibit its major development. Given South Africa’s heavy dependence on coal for power generation and electricity supply, an anticipated peak production in 2020 will cause problems for future economic growth...|$|R
40|$|Sandstones that overlie or {{that are}} {{interbedded}} with evaporitic or other ductile strata commonly contain numerous localized domains of fractures, each covering {{an area of}} a few square miles. Fractures within the Entrada Sandstone at the Salt Valley Anticline are associated with salt mobility within the underlying Paradox Formation. The fracture relationships observed at Salt Valley (along with examples from Paleozoic strata at {{the southern edge of}} the Holbrook basin in northeastern Arizona, and sandstones of the Frontier Formation along {{the western edge of the}} Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming), show that although each fracture domain may contain consistently oriented fractures, the orientations and patterns of the fractures vary considerably from domain to domain. Most of the fracture patterns in the brittle sandstones are related to local stresses created by subtle, irregular flexures resulting from mobility of the associated, <b>interbedded</b> ductile <b>strata</b> (halite or shale). Sequential episodes of evaporite dissolution and/or mobility in different directions can result in multiple, superimposed fracture sets in the associated sandstones. Multiple sets of superimposed fractures create reservoir-quality fracture interconnectivity within restricted localities of a formation. However, it is difficult to predict the orientations and characteristics of this type of fracturing in the subsurface. This is primarily because the orientations and characteristics of these fractures typically have little relationship to the regional tectonic stresses that might be used to predict fracture characteristics prior to drilling. Nevertheless, the high probability of numerous, intersecting fractures in such settings attests to the importance of determining fracture orientations in these types of fractured reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} revised lithostratigraphy for the Voltaian Supergroup of Ghana, {{based on a}} review of {{existing}} literature, interpretations of remotely sensed data and reconnaissance field survey of the Volta Basin. These strata thicken eastwards, to a maximum of between 5 and 6 km adjacent to the Pan-African Dahomeyide orogen. They began to accumulate some time after about 1000 Ma, along the margin of an epicontinental sea. Initial sedimentation, comprising the age-equivalent Kwahu and Bombouaka Groups, shows a cyclical mode of deposition controlled by eustatic changes in sea-level that produced a range of nearshore marine, littoral and terrestrial environments. A major erosional interval was followed by deposition of the 3 – 4 km thick Oti-Pendjari Group. Basal tillites and associated sandy diamictons are correlated with the Marinoan (end-Cryogenian) glaciation, indicating a maximum depositional age of about 635 Ma. The overlying cap carbonates and tuffs were deposited within a shallow epeiric sea bordered by a volcanically active rift system. The main part of the group records the transition from a rifted passive margin to a fully developed foreland basin receiving marine flysch in the form of argillaceous <b>strata</b> <b>interbedded</b> with highly immature wacke-type sandstones and conglomerates. Maximum accommodation space was developed within a foredeep adjacent to the Dahomeyide belt. Towards the end of the orogenic phase, the foredeep succession became partially inverted and then was buried under coarse terrestrial, red-bed molasse of the Obosum Group. ...|$|R
40|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} (SSD) {{is widely}} {{described in the}} literature, {{but there is no}} clear consensus regarding its origin and significance. Existing models for SSD in fluvial sediments do not clearly demonstrate a relationship between the structures, preserved facies expression, and larger-scale depositional architecture. In this study several types of SSD structures are recorded in Cambrian fluvial deposits and these occur <b>interbedded</b> with undeformed <b>strata</b> throughout the entire stratigraphic interval. The random distribution of these features in relation to primary facies types and fluvial forms indicates that they have neither a direct nor indirect relationship with any depositional processes or bedform type. We propose that the relationship of SSD at the bed-set-scale to larger-scale depositional architecture, combined with tectono-stratigraphic analysis allows the determination of both short-term fluvial hydraulic conditions in ancient stream systems, such as the nature of the flow regime responsible for depositing ancient fluvial stream successions, and the long-term subsidence rates, in the form of mean recurrence interval of the seismic events responsible for triggering the generation of SSD in tectonically active basins.

40|$|The gas {{reserves}} and well spacing {{units in the}} Horseshoe Canyon-Belly River Formation coal measures in Alberta are assigned based on gas-in-place determined by canister desorption tests of coal following ERCB (2010) guidelines. However, substantial gas, which is not measured by desorption tests, also occurs {{in the free state}} within the coals as well as adsorbed and in the free state within adjacent fine-grained strata (referred to here as shales) interbedded with the coals. A series of laboratory experiments (matrix flux, volumetric strain, rock mechanics) were conducted to quantify the reservoir properties of the coals and shales and were integrated with the results from field tests (well logs, pressure build-up) to be used as model inputs for a reservoir simulator. The purpose of the modeling was to address two main ques-tions: 1) do variations in the amount of free gas within the matrix porosity of the coal seams affect production; and 2) to what extent is the gas stored within the <b>strata</b> <b>interbedded</b> with the coal seams co-produced? The free gas stored within a coal seam with an effective matrix porosity of 8 % is shown to comprise on the order of 25 % of the total original gas-in-place. The modeling results show that in high permeability coals (150 mD), an increase in production equivalent to the additional gas-in-place resulting from the free gas occurs after 25 years. Even very low permeability reservoirs (0. 3 mD) are modeled to experience an approximately 2 % increase in cumulative gas after 50 years of production...|$|R
40|$|Important {{controlling}} {{factors of}} mass movements are generally soil water and geometric-topographic terrain {{factors such as}} inclination, curvature type and degree, and the relative position of unstable slopes and embankments. In addition, various geologic parameters that have a direct or indirect connection to soil-mechanical properties of slide masses are also of importance. Some studies also emphasise tectonic parameters {{in the context of}} susceptibility to mass movements. This study considers the relevance of tectonic and structural parameters in bedrock formations for landslides in periglacial hillslope sediments on top of the bedrock. The research area is part of the southern Solling anticline, a saddle structure in the Middle Bunter Sandstone formation in northern Hesse and southern Lower Saxony (Germany). In this geologic formation, sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone are <b>interbedded</b> with impermeable <b>strata.</b> Uplift of the Solling anticline, in particular during the Quaternary, resulted in a partially intensive dissection of the Bunter Sandstone plateau into separate blocks with disrupted, tilted, and partially rotated layers. The structural conditions have an indirect impact upon landslides in the superposed hillslope sediments. Water flow along strata and joints above water impermeable strata cause water infiltration and moistening of the periglacial hillslope sediments on top of the bedrock. Mass movements are frequently linked to sites of outcrop springs and occur after long periods of rainfall. A GIS-based analysis was used to statistically evaluate possible factors controlling landslides. Factors were weighted and included in an empiric-statistical model that allows spatial description of hazard potentials due to mass movements. In addition to morphologic parameters, the structural parameters of the bedrock are of utmost importance for the occurrence of landslides...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{occurrence of}} organic-carbon-rich strata (‘black shales’) in certain portions of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenozoic sequences has been well-documented from Deep Sea Drilling Project {{sites in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and from sequences, now exposed on land, originally deposited in the Tethyan ocean. These ancient black shales usually have been explained by analogy with examples of modern deep-sea sediments in which organic matter locally is preserved by (1) increasing the supply of organic matter, (2) increasing the rate of sedimentation, and/or (3) decreasing the oxygen content of the bottom water. However, detailed examination of many black shales reveals characteristics that cannot be explained by simple local models, including: their approximate coincidence in time globally; their occurrence {{in a variety of}} different environments, including open oxygenated oceans, restricted basins, deep and shallow water; their <b>interbedding</b> with organic-carbonpoor <b>strata</b> which often dominate a so-called black shale sequence; their deposition by pelagic, hemipelagic, turbiditic and other processes; and the variations in type and amount of organic matter that occur even within the same sequence. A more complex model for the origin of black shales therefore appears most appropriate, in which the cyclic preservation of organic matter depends on the interplay of the three main variables, namely supply of organic matter, sedimentation rate, and deep-water oxygenation, each of which varies independently to some extent. The variation and relative importance of these parameters in individual basins and widespread black shale deposition in general are linked globally and temporally by changes in global sea-level, climate and related changes in oceanic circulation. An important and often overlooked factor for the supply of organic matter to deep-basin sediments is the frequency and magnitude of redepositional processes. The interplay of these variables is discussed in relation to the middle Cretaceous and Cenozoic organic-carbon-rich strata, in particular, which show marked differences in the relative importance of the different variables...|$|R
40|$|Current basin {{models for}} the Western Irish Namurian Basin (WINB) {{envisage}} an elongate trough {{along the line of}} the present-day Shannon Estuary that was infilled with clastic sediments derived from a hinterland that lay to the W or NW. This paper argues for an alternative basin configuration with source areas to the SW supplying sediment to a basin where deepest water conditions were in northern County Clare. Rapid subsidence along the present-day Shannon Estuary ponded sediment in this area throughout the early Namurian and, only with the rapid increase of sedimentation rates within the mid-Namurian (Kinderscoutian Stage), were substantial amounts of sediment able to prograde to the NE of the basin. This alternative model better explains the overwhelming predominance of NE-directed palaeocurrents in the Namurian infill, but requires fundamental revisions to most aspects of current depositional models. Deep-water black shales (Clare Shale Formation) initially accumulated throughout the region and were progressively downlapped by an unconfined turbidite system (Ross Formation) prograding to the NE. This in turn was succeeded by an unstable, siltstone-dominated slope system (Gull Island Formation) characterized by large-scale soft-sediment deformation, which also prograded to the NE. In the northern-most basin outcrops, in northern County Clare, this early phase of basin infill was developed as a condensed succession of radiolarian-rich black shales, minor turbiditic sandstones and undisturbed siltstones. The new basin model envisages the northern exposures of County Clare to be a distal, basin floor succession whereas the traditional model considers it a relatively shallow, winnowed, basin margin succession. Later stages of basin infill consist of a series of deltaic cycles that culminate in major, erosive-based sandstone bodies (e. g. Tullig Sandstone) interpreted either as axial, deltaic feeder channels or incised valley fills genetically unrelated to the underlying deltaic facies. Within the context of the new basin model the former alternative is most likely and estimated channel depths within the Tullig Sandstone indicate that the basal erosive surface could have been generated by intrinsic fluvial scour without recourse to base-level fall. The northerly flowing Tullig channels pass down-dip into isolated channel sandbodies <b>interbedded</b> with wave-dominated <b>strata</b> that suggest the deltas of the WINB were considerably more wave-influenced than hitherto proposed. The retreat of the Tullig delta during sea-level rise saw the rapid southerly retrogradation of parasequences, as may be expected if the basin margin lay to the SW of the present-day outcrops. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{are very}} pleased with the attention, long overdue, that the Triassic–Jurassic {{boundary}} and associated events, such as the CAMP, are receiving. This can only lead to greater specificity of hypotheses and greater understanding in the long run, and it is worth emphasizing some broad areas of agreement. Marzoli et al. (2008 -this volume) points out the closeness in time of CAMP and Tr–J extinctions, and on this we all agree. We also agree that the systematic differences among different isotopic systems used for dating is a challenge to determining the relative timing of events dated with different techniques. This problem, however, seem to be fading as high-precision single-crystal U–Pb dates (206 Pb/ 238 U) are available from a variety of tuffs <b>interbedded</b> with marine <b>strata</b> as well as the North Mountain Basalt of Nova Scotia, which lies above the palynological Triassic–Jurassic extinction event in Nova Scotia. Schoene et al. (2006) obtained an age of 201. 27 ± 0. 03 Ma from this basalt, which is very close to an age of 201. 5 Ma for a tuff 1 m above the last local occurrence of the topmost Triassic guide-fossil, the ammonite Choristoceras in a marine section in Peru (Schaltegger et al., 2007), presumably very close to the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. Schaltegger et al. (2007) also obtained an age of 199. 5 Ma for the Hettangian–Sinemurian boundary from the latter section. Consistent with these ages, Pálfy and Mundil (2006) obtained ages of 200. 6 ± 0. 3 Ma for an ash layer in ammonite-bearing Middle Hettangian marine sediments in, Alaska, and 198. 0 ± 0. 6 Ma for a tuff layer in Early Sinemurian sediments in Hungary. These dates are not compatible with the multi-crystal age for the Triassic–Jurassic boundary of 199. 6 ± 0. 3 Ma of Pálfy and Mundil (2006), a fact recognized by Pálfy and Mundil (2006). Thus, we are in complete agreement that the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event is extremely close in time to the onset of the CAMP. The question is, "are any of the known flows of the CAMP actually at or before this extinction event?". That is the key issue dealt with by Whiteside et al. (2007), and it is a possibility that we recognize as completely plausible, but not yet demonstrated. It is in that spirit of general agreement that we reply to Marzoli et al. 's, comment. We note, however, that their comment touches on far too many points to adequately address in this reply, and we chose to focus our response on their most substantive issues, recalling that our paper was focusing on the testable aspects of their overall hypothesis. We deal with their criticisms in the order they present them...|$|R
40|$|Stratigraphic, sedimentologic and {{compositional}} {{data collected from}} the Triassic Moenkopi Formation adjacent to the Castle Valley salt anticline, Paradox Basin, Utah indicate passive diapirism of the salt wall with well-developed topography and exposed salt during the Early Triassic. Moenkopi strata thin to 150 m on to the Castle Valley salt anticline and thicken to an estimated 275 m away from it, indicating control of sedimentation by salt-generated topography. The distribution of nine terrestrial facies assemblages within Moenkopi Formation strata {{on the margins of}} Castle Valley Salt Wall, in combination with identification of three halokinetic sequences interpreted from stratal architecture adjacent to the salt wall, further support this assertion. ^ Nine terrestrial facies were recognized within the Moenkopi Formation in the study area: 1) channel-form sandstone and organized conglomerate (axial fluvial), 2) thinly-interbedded siltstone and fine-grained sandstone (fluvial overbank), 3) tabular-lenticular siltstone and sandstone sheets (unconfined channels and sheet floods), 4) structureless to weakly-bedded sandstone (distal wadi fan), 5) disorganized conglomerate (debris flow from exposed diapir), 6) well-sorted, well-rounded sandstone (eolian sand sheets), 7) gypsic sandstone (eolian sand), 8) gypsic paleosols and 9) calcic paleosols. ^ The location and distribution of axial channel facies, in addition to paleocurrents that are generally parallel to the northwest trending long axis of the salt wall, suggest that large drainage systems were controlled by salt diapir topography. At the northwest termination of Castle Valley, the salt wall bends abruptly to the north, where paleocurrents also shifted to the north. ^ Local gypsum sheet sandstones and thin debris-flow beds containing reworked clasts of gypsum and carbonate “caprock” derived from the diapiric Paradox Formation of Pennsylvanian age provide evidence for significant topography and exposed evaporite during Moenkopi deposition. The salt diapir itself is therefore interpreted to have provided the sulfate source for both gypsic paleosols and gypsic sandstone sheets in the Moenkopi. The world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest documented gypsic paleosols are found in overbank <b>strata</b> <b>interbedded</b> with high width/depth ratio sandstone bodies deposited by ephemeral rivers. In combination, these features indicate arid to semi-arid, wadi environments for the lower three Moenkopi Formation members (Tenderfoot, Ali Baba and Sewemup). The uppermost Pariott Member lacks gypsum and contains calcic paleosols, indicating a change to a semi-arid climate. This data in combination with facies differences between the uppermost member and the lower three members suggest that the Pariott Member should not be assigned to the Moenkopi Formation and should either be included in the Chinle Formation strata or reassigned to formation status. ^ Each member is characterized by distinct facies associations, facies-association distributions and stratal geometries. As such, each of the four members represents a stage of salt-sediment deposition with corresponding wedge and hook halokinetic sequences (HS) identified. The HS comprise three composite halokinetic sequences (CHS) : a 1) northeast flank of wedge HS that build into a tapered CHS, 2) a western Red Hills series of wedge HS that build into a tapered CHS and 3) an eastern Red Hills series of hook HS that build into tabular CHS. Wedge HS indicate that sediment accumulation rates were greater than diapiric rise rates to the northeast and to the west-southwest of the salt wall. The hook HS {{on the east side of}} the weld, where abrupt facies changes occur and strata thickens away significantly, indicates the area experienced higher diapiric rise rate than sediment accumulation, most likely due to deflation related to a sharp bend in the salt wall.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Presentation date: 1987 - 10 - 16 Eight Tertiary {{sedimentary}} and volcanic units crop out in {{the thesis}} area. From oldest to youngest they are the: Sager Creek formation (informal); Pittsburg Bluff Formation; Northrup Creek formation (informal); Smuggler Cove formation (informal); Wickiup Mountain and Cannon Beach members (both informal) of the Astoria Formation; the Grande Ronde Basalt, and Frenchman Springs Member of the Wanapum Basalt, both of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Also, areally limited, unnamed sedimentary <b>strata</b> <b>interbedded</b> between flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group crop {{out in the}} study area. Quaternary deposits consist of alluvium, colluvium, and landslide debris. Rhythmically-bedded, foram-bearing, carbonaceous to micaceous mudstone and graded, fine-grained, feldspathic turbidite sandstone are the dominant lithologies of the upper Eocene (Refugian) Sager Creek formation. Plane-laminae and climbing ripple-laminae typical of Bouma b,c, and d intervals are common in the thin turbidite sandstone beds. Contemporaneous, rare, thick, sandstones may represent submarine feeder channels that supplied the more widespread, thinly-bedded overbank turbidite sandstones. Foraminiferal paleobathymetry indicates that deposition was in bathyal water depths. Sager Creek deposition {{was followed by a}} regression or offlap of the late Eocene to early Oligocene (Refugian) sea as indicated by the molluscan fossils and thick, bioturbated sandstone of the predominantly shallow-marine Pittsburg Bluff Formation. The lower part of the formation consists of outer shelf, glauconitic, fossiliferous sandstone and subordinate mudstone. Higher in the section are middle-shelf, fine-grained, bioturbated, tuffaceous, arkosic sandstones. These sandstones contain minor glauconite, wave- and storm-generated molluscan shell hash beds, carbonized wood fragments, and calcareous concretions. Deposition occurred in 20 - 50 m open-marine shelf water depths; however, the depositional environment may have shallowed to a bay-like setting (Moore, 1982, written communication). The upper part of the unit consists of thin- to medium-bedded, carbonaceous siltstone and mudstone with minor ashfall tuffs. Therefore, deposition of the Pittsburg Bluff Formation occurred as a shallowing-upward, then deepening depositional episode, punctuated by contemporaneous, intermittent eruption of nearby calc-alkaline western Cascade volcanoes. The deep-marine Oligocene to lower Miocene (Zemorrian to Saucesian) Northrup Creek formation is predominantly composed of thinly-laminated mudstone interbedded with thin, very fine-grained, graded, micaceous arkosic sandstone. Bouma c-d-e and a-b-e sequences are common in the turbidite sandstone; Bouma a-e intervals occur locally in sandstone/mudstone couplets. Paleocurrent indicators suggest that the predominant transport direction of these turbidite deposits was northeast to southwest. Abraded, carbonaceous plant debris and mica are abundant in the sandstone laminations. The upper part of the formation consists of thick, mollusk-bearing, moderately- to well-sorted, arkosic sandstone and minor polymict grit beds. A shallowing-upward, high-energy, shallow-marine shelf environment of deposition is indicated for {{the upper part of the}} formation. Contemporaneous with shelf and slope deposition of the Sager Creek, Pittsburg Bluff and Northrup Creek formations, the deep-water late Eocene to early Miocene Smuggler Cove formation was deposited as a distal or lateral correlative in a low-energy, outer shelf to slope setting. This foram-bearing unit consists of thick, bioturbated, bathyal, tuffaceous mudstone and siltstone with minor thin- to thick-bedded ashfall and current-reworked tuff. A marine onlap is indicated by the conformable relationship between the upper sandstone unit of the Northrup Creek formation and the overlying Smuggler Cove formation in the eastern part of the thesis area. The overlying lower to middle Miocene Astoria Formation contains two members in the thesis area: a high-energy, shallow shelf, fine- to medium-grained, fossiliferous, micaceous arkosic sandstone (Wickiup Mountain member), and an overlying, thinly-laminated, deepmarine mudstone (Cannon Beach member). Diatom floras indicate that a thermal "oceanographic irregularity" (water warmer than normal) may have occurred during deposition of the Cannon Beach member. At least six, and possibly eight, flows of the middle Miocene Grande Ronde Basalt (Columbia River Basalt Group) are present in the thesis area. Individual flows have been ascribed to the (N 1 ?), R 2, and N 2 magnetozones. Geochemically, the flows consist of low MgO high Ti 02, low MgO low Ti 02, and high MgO subtypes. These subaerial to submarine flows are correlated to Mangan and others (1986) chemical subtypes 2 D, 5 C, 5 A, and 4 A of the Columbia Plateau-derived Grande Ronde Basalt of eastern Washington and eastern Oregon. The correlations are based on similarity of age, major element chemistry, stratigraphic position, and magnetic polarity. Field evidence suggests that thick, submarine pillow and breccia complexes generated sufficient pressure to autoinvasively inject into the Eocene to middle Miocene sedimentary strata of the Plympton/Porter ridge and Elk Mountain areas. This process apparently formed many randomly-oriented dike- and sill-like intrusions in the western part of the thesis area. However, in the eastern and central parts of the thesis area, three sub-parallel dikes (the Northrup, Beneke, and Fishhawk Falls dikes) extend along linear trends for tens of kilometers. This suggests that their emplacement was, in part, influenced by earlier or contemporaneous regional tectonism. At least two, and as many as five, flows of the Frenchman Springs Member of the Wanapum Basalt occur in the thesis area: one to two abundantly plagioclase-phyric Basalt of Ginkgo flow(s), and one to three Basalt of Sand Hollow flows (terminology after Beeson and Tolan, 1985). These flows consist of subaqueous pillow palagonite breccia and vesicular, columnar-jointed, subaerial basalt. No Frenchman Springs flows are invasive in the thesis area. Local middle Miocene sedimentary interbeds between flows of Grande Ronde and Frenchman Springs Basalt are lithologically and sedimentologically diverse. Common lithologies are fine- to mediumgrained, arkosic sandstone, coarse-grained basaltic sandstone, and structureless mudstone. Depositional environments represented by these strata are fluvial, marginal-marine, and shallow-marine. Thicknesses of individual interbeds range from 0. 2 to 50 m. The thesis area is located on the northwest flank of the Oregon Coast Range anticline, adjacent to the Nehalem Arch. Large-scale northeast-trending oblique to strike-slip left-lateral faults coupled with northwest-trending oblique to strike-slip right-lateral faults dominate the structure of the area. These faults may have formed as conjugate shears (Riedel shear) caused by north-south compressive stress related to the oblique subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate. Five episodes of deformation are suggested by faults, dike orientations, unconformities, and other geological relationships within the thesis area: a late Eocene north-south compressional episode, an early Oligocene to early Miocene uplift, a middle Miocene northwest-southeast extensional episode, a post-middle Miocene to Pliocene (?) north-south compressional episode, and a north-south extensional event that occurred between the post-middle Miocene and Recent. Although crushed rock (for road and revetment construction) is currently the primary mineral resource within the thesis area, several potential fault traps on this northwest flank of the Nehalem Arch may contain significant reserves of natural gas. This conclusion is based upon field, laboratory, and subsurface (well) data. The Clark and Wilson sandstone of the middle to late Eocene Cowlitz Formation, the producing unit at the nearby Mist gas field, represents the most attractive target horizon. Additionally, the porous and permeable upper sandstone unit of the Northrup Creek formation could contain shallow hydrocarbon reserves beneath the northern part of the area...|$|R
