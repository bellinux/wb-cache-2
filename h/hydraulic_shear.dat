50|$|Banana powder {{is formed}} by using banana pulp, which is {{mechanically}} chopped and then processed with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shear</b> using a colloid mill, {{turning it into}} a paste. Sodium metabisulfite is then used to brighten the yellow color of the paste. The paste is then dried by either spray- or drum-drying, although the latter is more common because none of the paste is lost while drying. The drum-drying also produces about 2% more powder and also dries it more thoroughly. Regardless of the drying process banana powder can generally only stay fresh on the shelf for about a year before passing its expiration date.|$|E

Colloid mills work on the rotor-stator principle: a rotor turns at high speeds (2000 - 18000 RPM). The resulting high levels of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shear</b> applied to the process liquid disrupt structures in the fluid.

50|$|The {{three-dimensional}} lateral confinement of CCS {{along with}} anchoring techniques ensures the long-term stability of slopes using vegetated topsoil, aggregate or concrete surfacing (if exposed to severe mechanical and hydraulic pressures).

The baseline technology used at LANL for removal of glove box legs is a reciprocating saw. Legs on glove boxes are typically either 3 -inch diameter pipe or unistrut.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, hydraulic stimulation is {{the most}} commonly used technique for improving the permeability of a geothermal reservoir. Some of the world's EGS projects can extract geothermal energy from naturally fractured reservoirs, such as Northwest Geysers, Landau, Insheim, Urach, Bruchsal, Soultz-sous-Fôrets, Fjällbacka, Hijiori, Rosemanowes, Falkenberg and Newberry. The pre-existing naturally fractured networks can be stimulated by low pressure that is just above the critical pressure of <b>shear</b> failure (<b>hydraulic</b> <b>shearing).</b> However, the process of hydraulic fracturing, which uses injected water at high pressure to crack the rocks, is also frequently used especially in granite. Compared with hydraulic fracturing with high injection pressure, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shearing</b> can easily crack rocks with low pressure and keep the fractures open without requiring a propping agent. Chemical stimulation, which is most applicable in carbonate rocks or used to dissolve carbonate cement in sandstone formations, along with thermal stimulation has also proved to be effective in some cases. However, there is relatively little literature concerning the application of chemical and thermal stimulation technologies in EGS projects.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA coupled fluid-solid {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented. The solid phase {{consists of a}} granular assembly where dynamics of each solid particle is described with the discrete element method. In the inter-particle space the fluid flow is solved with the lattice Boltzmann method. Interactions between the solid phase and the fluid phase result from the integration, over the solid particle boundary, of the momentum exchange between solid and fluid phases. Consequently, assumptions about fluid-solid interactions are very limited with such a coupling. To illustrate abilities and limits of the coupled method {{in the framework of}} internal soil erosion, a two-dimensional model of piping erosion is considered (inspired from the hole erosion test). Direct simulations of erosion of a cohesive- frictional granular matter have been performed for different values of water pressure gradient and inter-particle cohesion. As classically found experimentally, the mass rate of erosion follows a relation of the kind of Shield's law, with a linear dependency on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shear</b> stress. A critical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shear</b> stress, below which detachment of particles does not occur, can be identified and {{is directly related to the}} inter-particle cohesion.

40|$|Granules are large, {{self-supporting}} biofilms {{that form}} naturally in high-rate anaerobic treatment systems and are {{extremely important to}} reactor functionality. Granules exhibit functional and phylogenetic layering, interesting to both scientists and technologists. Until now, it has only been possible to analyze layering through sectioning and microscopic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization, or to analyze the whole granule through DNA extraction and microbial community profiling methods. This means different functional and spatial layers cannot be analyzed separately, including next generation sequencing techniques, such as pyrotag sequencing. In this work, we describe a method to remove microbes selectively from successive spatial layers through <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shearing</b> and demonstrate its application on anaerobic granules of three different types (VFA-, carbohydrate-, protein-fed) in size ranges 0. 6 - 2 mm.
