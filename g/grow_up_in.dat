5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, {{and there are some}} grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E

25|$|Early {{intervention}} programs, such as school-based {{programs to}} prevent dating violence are also effective. Children who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> violent homes may {{be led to}} believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.|$|E
25|$|Bull sharks have {{an unusual}} migratory pattern in {{comparison}} to other sharks. They are found in rivers all over the world. They give birth in the fresh water of rivers.

25|$|Under normal conditions, {{language}} {{seems to}} develop {{in a similar way}} among all children but when children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a radically different environment their language is significantly different. A number of examples including wild children show that certain elements of the early environment are essential for language learning. Amala and Kamala and Genie never managed to fully progress to learning language. While these examples are extreme, they show that consumer’s language is affected by their environment. This is especially true of marketing activities across geographical borders.|$|E

25|$|In a study {{performed}} at Örebro University, mothers {{of young children}} were interviewed to study attitudes on swedishness, multiculturalism and segregation. It concluded that while many expressed values as ethnic diversity being an enriching factor, but when in practice it came to choosing schools or choosing district to move to, ensuring the children had a access to a school with robust Swedish majority as they don't wanted their children to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a school as a minority and getting a good Swedish language learning environment.|$|E
25|$|Preservationist {{movements}} have begun in some ranch house neighborhoods, {{as well as}} renewed interest in the style from a younger generation who did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> ranch-style houses. This renewed interest in the style {{has been compared to}} that which other house styles such as the bungalow and Queen Anne experienced in the 20th century, initial dominance of the market, replacement as the desired housing style, decay and lack of interest coupled with many teardowns, then renewed interest and modernization of the surviving houses.|$|E
25|$|Kravitz {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York, {{the only child of}} actress Roxie Roker (1929–1995) and NBC {{television}} news producer Sy Kravitz. His father was from a Jewish family (with origins from Ukraine; see the Kravits surname). His mother was of Bahamian and African-American descent, and was from a Christian family. Kravitz is the cousin (once removed) of television weather presenter Al Roker. During his early years, Kravitz did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a religious environment. After a spiritual experience when he was 13, he started attending church, becoming a non-denominational Christian.|$|E
50|$|There is {{consensus}} in the literature about {{the negative consequences of}} <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single-parent homes on educational attainment and success. Children <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single-parent homes are more likely to not finish school and generally obtain fewer years of schooling than those in two-parent homes. Specifically, boys <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> homes with only their mothers are more likely to receive poorer grades and display behavioral problems.|$|R

25|$|With all {{the focus}} on veterans, the {{children}} are left to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one might think {{that there would be}} inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances of growing up in his book (later a movie), The Great Santini.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{especially}} vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy {{physical and mental health}} of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self-worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has {{experienced}} a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes {{information on how to}} hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.|$|E

25|$|A {{review study}} {{suggested}} that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed {{and are more likely}} to be open to homoerotic relationships, partly due to genetic (80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in the US are not adopted and most are the result of heterosexual marriages)) and family socialization processes (children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist), even though majority of children raised by same-sex couples identify as heterosexual. A 2005 review by Charlotte J. Patterson for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents. One study suggested that children of gay and lesbian parents were more likely to adopt non-heterosexual identities, especially daughters of lesbian parents (inter-generational transfer was not significant in some analyses for sons).|$|E
25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, as best she could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not even have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E
