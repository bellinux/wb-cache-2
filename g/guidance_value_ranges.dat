40|$|Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) {{are defined}} as the {{concentration}} or range of concentrations of a chemical or its metabolite in a biological medium (blood, urine, or other medium) {{that is consistent with}} an existing health-based exposure guideline such as a reference dose (RfD) or tolerable daily intake (TDI). BE values {{can be used as a}} screening tool for the evaluation of population-based biomonitoring data in the context of existing risk assessments. This study reviews available health based risk assessments and exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> for di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) from Health Canada, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Controlled dosing data reporting the urinary excretion fractions of major DINP metabolites following administration of labeled DINP are reviewed, and BE values corresponding to the available exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> are derived assuming chronic, steady-state intake and excretion at those exposure values.

40|$|AbstractSince 2007, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) {{has been}} {{collecting}} biomonitoring {{data from the}} general Canadian population and has provided, to date, nationally representative concentrations for hundreds of environmental biomarkers in blood or urine. Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) have been developed as tools to help interpret biomonitoring data in a health risk context at a population level. In this paper, BEs are used to relate biomonitoring data from the CHMS (2007 – 2011) to existing exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> developed by Health Canada and other government agencies. Chemical-specific hazard quotients (HQs) and/or cancer risk estimates are calculated using existing BEs corresponding to environmental chemicals analyzed in the CHMS. For the majority of environmental chemicals, calculated HQ values are less than 1 indicating exposure is below published exposure <b>guidance</b> <b>values.</b> Individual biomonitoring data for two biomarkers of metal exposure (inorganic arsenic and cadmium) resulted in HQ values exceeding 1 suggesting that exposure may be above existing <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> {{for a portion of}} the population, at least intermittently.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} {{charged with}} the protection of public health, such as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), must have a reference, or comparison value, upon which to base an evaluation of potential health threat posed by any substance or chemical. The basis, or starting points, for such evaluations may have different names or acronyms, but represent {{more or less the}} same thing. These values for non-carcinogenic endpoints are called oral Reference Doses (RIDs) and inhalation Reference Concentrations (RfCs) by the USEPA, Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) by the FDA, and oral and inhalation Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) by the ATSDR. Too often, however, RIDs, Rfes, MRLs, and ADIs are construed as rigid, threshold limits, above which toxicity is likely to occur. The truth, however, is that these values actually represent levels of a potential toxicant that are highly unlikely to represent any threat to human health over a particular/specified duration of daily exposures. The more frequently these levels are exceeded and the greater the exceedance, the more likely some toxic manifestation is to occur. These guidance/reference values are most definitely not threshold values for the onset of toxicity in any exposed popu lation. Health <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> must be thought of in the context of their intended role as mere screening or trigger values, in which they serve as a tool for assisting in the determination of whether further evaluation of a given potential exposure scenario is warranted.

Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects in the age group of 19 - 35 years, free from temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and occlusal disharmony, with healthy dentition participated in the study. Hanau H 2 (non-arcon type) and Hanau Wide-Vue (arcon type) articulators were programmed for sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> using the same protrusive record made in polysiloxane bite registration material with edge to edge degree of protrusion. The resultant values for both the articulators on either side were compared with values obtained from tracing of digital lateral cephalogram using Kodak Dental imaging Window software 6. 6. 3. 0 -C program. The tabulated data were subjected to statistical analysis, ANOVA (Fishers ′F′ test) for group comparison, Tukey′s HSD test for inter-comparison, student′s unpaired ′t′ test for intra-group comparison, and level of significance (P) was calculated using the same. Results: The mean sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> of the three different groups were found to be very highly significant (P= 0. 001) and highly significant (P= 0. 002) on the right and left sides respectively. There was a very highly significant difference (P= 0. 001) and highly significant difference (P= 0. 003) between the arcon and non-arcon group on the right and left side respectively. No significant difference was found between the arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 284 right, P= 0. 853 left) and a statistically significant difference was found between the non-arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 049 right, P= 0. 015 left). On intragroup comparison there was no statistically significant difference in sagittal condylar values on the right and left sides. Conclusion: The mean difference in the sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> obtained from non-arcon and arcon articulators shows a low level of reproducibility, and no significant difference found in mean sagittal condylar values obtained from arcon articulator and cephalometric tracings indicates replication of sagittal condylar <b>guidance</b> <b>value</b> from image of articular eminence...|$|R

To reduce the health risks, <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> for technically unavoidable PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these <b>guidance</b> <b>values</b> and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products.

According to the knowledge currently available, the BfR must assume that defective products are still being marketed. Such products do not comply with good manufacturing practice and constitute a risk for human health. In general, manufacturers should reduce PAH concentrations in their products as much as possible since no threshold values can be given for some PAHs below which health risks can be excluded. In order to protect consumers from health risks, BfR proposes the setting of statutory limit values for PAHs and BaP.

40|$|Number of pages: 81 The {{focus of}} this report is to {{introduce}} Static Single-Assignment (SSA) Form and <b>Value</b> <b>Range</b> Propagation for Uppaal [BDL 04]. <b>Value</b> <b>Range</b> Propagation uses the SSA form to conduct its analysis.

In this report I show how <b>Value</b> <b>Range</b> Propagation can be used in the context of Uppaal, possibly improving the performance of the tool. Using automated <b>value</b> <b>range</b> propagation in Uppaal will eliminate the need for users to manually optimize the ranges of their defined variables. Moreover, it allows less experienced users of Uppaal, which unknowingly may design models, containing unnecessary large amounts of unbound integer variables, to concentrate about modeling instead of tightening every variable bound. The <b>Value</b> <b>Range</b> Propagation is done by analyzing the control-flow of a model, in order to generate the SSA form.

The development of reliable and ecofriendly processes for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is an important step in the field of application of nanotechnology. In this study, we address the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Leucas aspera leaf extract, and evaluate its lethal concentration (LC 50 and LC 90) values against first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of the mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. The nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis. Larvae and pupae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extracts of synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. The maximum mortality was observed from synthesized AgNPs, with LC 50 values for I-IV instars and pupae ranging from 13. 06 to 25. 54, and LC 90 <b>values</b> <b>ranging</b> from 24. 11 to 47. 34 for A. aegypti; for A. stephensi, the corresponding LC 50 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 12. 45 to 22. 26, and the LC 90 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 23. 50 to 42. 95. With methanol leaf extract of L. aspera against A. aegypti, the LC 50 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 174. 89 to 462. 96 and the LC 90 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 488. 16 to 963. 74; for A. stephensi, the corresponding LC 50 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 148. 93 to 417. 07 and the LC 90 <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 449. 72 to 912. 94. The study suggests that nanoparticles could be a preferred alternative to the most hazardous existing chemical pesticides, contributing to a more healthy environment by providing an ideal ecological and user-friendly vector control strategy for managing malaria and dengue, and contributing to their eventual elimination in the near future...|$|R
