5|$|Soon after, {{physicists}} were {{rocked by}} the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This inspired Ward to consider particle physics again. Along with many others, he consider how gauge theory {{could be applied to}} Fermi's theory of beta decay. Ward became {{one of the authors of}} the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. Ward wrote a note to Abdus, informing him that Albert Einstein would be spinning <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave,</b> presumably clockwise.|$|E

The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when it turns out to be the wrong body <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bent upon making others suffer as he had, Justinian had an {{expedition}} sent against the Exarchate of Ravenna, for reasons which elude historians today— though sheer madness cannot be ruled out. Upon arriving there the expedition led by Theodore sacked the city whilst his men deceptively invited the officials to a banquet {{where they were}} seized and sent to Constantinople. Upon arrival they were met by Justinian, who had them all executed except the Archbishop, who nonetheless suffered a blinding and the usual exile— {{not being able to}} return until Justinian was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave.</b> It was this execution that led to Ravenna being looted by Theodore and his men.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave</b> on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E
500|$|Ranulf died on 5 September 1128. He {{was buried}} in his chapter house in Durham, where his tomb was opened in 1874.

While he was efficient in collecting the royal revenues, he was generous to his own men, and later in life gave liberally to the poor. His crozier and signet ring were found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave,</b> and they were rather plain.

Enraged that Kratos {{had failed}} to rescue him sooner and stating he will never forgive him, Deimos attacks and overpowers Kratos. However, Thanatos {{intervenes}} and takes a protesting Deimos to Suicide Bluffs (the site of Kratos' suicide attempt), where Kratos saves Deimos from falling to his death. A grateful Deimos then aids his brother in battling the god with the Arms of Sparta. Thanatos, however, kills Deimos but is destroyed, in turn, by Kratos. Remarking that his brother is finally free, Kratos places Deimos <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave</b> (leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker), while the gravedigger states that Kratos has become [...] "Death... the Destroyer of Worlds."

500|$|The {{procession}} {{left the}} town hall and slowly went the [...] via Hope Street to an iron-lined grave in St James Cemetery, accompanied by muffled church bells. Iron rails were erected {{along the length of}} the funeral procession to hold back the crowd of around 50,000 people who lined the route. Emily Huskisson, devastated by grief, did not attend the funeral. Despite her objection to gun salutes a 32-pounder cannon was fired to mark the departure of the coffin from {{the town hall}} and a 6-pounder was fired to mark the body's arrival at the cemetery, and smaller guns were fired as the procession passed. On arrival at the cemetery a short 15 minute service was held, after which Huskisson's close mourners moved to the graveside and Huskisson was placed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave,</b> to the accompaniment of weeping from his brothers. Shortly before 1.00pm another cannon shot marked the end of the service, and the crowd dispersed; pubs and restaurants throughout Liverpool remained shut for the rest of the day.|$|E
500|$|The myth of Actaeon {{is known}} to have been narrated in the Catalogue by virtue of a {{paraphrase}} found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses. According to the dictionary, the Catalogue included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife, thus angering Zeus, who had designs upon the woman. Before this testimonium appeared, another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel, who tentatively attributed the text to the Catalogue. As the fragment opens, Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs, and a goddess—Athena or, less likely, Artemis—arrives at Chiron's cave. She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis, after which they will return to stay with Chiron. At this point the papyrus is damaged, {{but it is clear that}} the dogs are delivered from a [...] "madness" [...] ( [...] , lussa, line 15) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus. Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment, the latter calling it an [...] "incoherent epic pastiche" [...] which would cause the author of the Catalogue to [...] "turn <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave</b> if he knew that it had been attributed to him." [...] According to Glenn Most, some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic, but it is demonstrably archaic, and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the Catalogue.|$|E

500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>grave,</b> but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E
