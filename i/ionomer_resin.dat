40|$|Background: Scuba diving {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing sports in the world. The {{objective}} of this study was to evaluate the effect of pressure variations to which divers are exposed on the pull out strength of glass fiber post luted with different cements. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, 120 extracted, single-rooted lower premolars were endodontically treated. They were randomly divided into six groups and restored using the glass fiber post (Ivoclar Vivadent AG) and the following luting agents: Zinc phosphate, conventional glass <b>ionomer,</b> <b>resin</b> reinforced glass <b>ionomer,</b> <b>resin</b> cement with etch-and-rinse adhesive, resin cement with self-etching adhesive, and self-adhesive resin cement. Each group was randomly divided into two equal subgroups, one as a control, and the other to be used experimentally. After 7 days of storage, experimental groups were pressure cycled. The force required to dislodge each post was recorded in Newton (N) on Universal testing machine (Star Testing System) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Data were statistically analyzed using the ANOVA and Student′s t-test (P < 0. 001). Results: The pull out strength of posts cemented with zinc phosphate and conventional glass ionomer in pressure cycle group was significantly less than their control group. Although, no significant difference was found between pressure cycle and control group using resin reinforced glass ionomer cement and resin cements. Conclusion: Dentist should consider using resin reinforced glass ionomer or resin cement, for the cementation of glass fiber post, for the patients such as divers, who are likely to be exposed to pressure cycling...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Use {{of glass}} ionomer cement as pit and fissure sealant, has added benefit by its fluoride-releasing property. The {{efficacy}} of using invasive and non-invasive techniques {{was assessed by}} microleakage of Glass ionomer (Triage, G C Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Resin based sealants (Concise, 3 M Dental Products, USA). Methods and Materials: In this in vitro experimental study, 80 sound premolars were divided into four groups of 20. In groups 1 and 2, Triage and in groups 3 and 4, Concise was used. In groups 1 and 3, fissures leaved intact (Noninvasive technique). In groups 2 and 4, fissures were prepared with tapered diamond bur (Invasive technique). The teeth were thermocycled at 5 o- 55 oc for 250 cycles and immersed in 5 % methylene blue solution for 24 hours. Sectioned samples were observed for the extent of dye penetration, and scores were based on established scoring criteria. 0 - Without dye penetration. 1 - Dye penetration restricted to the outer half of the sealant. 2 - Dye penetration restricted to the inner half of the sealant. 3 - Dye penetration into the underlying fissure. The {{data were analyzed using}} Kruskall-Wallis and Man-Whitney tests. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between invasive and noninvasive techniques; but microleakage of Triage was statistically more than Concise. Conclusion: Because {{there was no difference between}} the two techniques, invasive technique is not recommended. Considering the recent controversies, it can be said that Triage cannot be a viable alternative for resin based sealants.

40|$|Background: Newer {{available}} {{composite resin}} adhesives have chromatic agents that change their color during setting from pink to colorless. It has an advantage of easy flash removal thus {{reducing the amount}} of plaque accumulation and helping patients to maintain better hygiene. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare shear bond strengths of light-cure orthodontic bonding agents, namely glass ionomer (FujiOrthoLC, GC Orthodontics), conventional composite resin (Transbond XT, 3 M Unitek), and color-changing composite resin (Transbond Plus, 3 M Unitek) with conventional etch and self-etch primer (Transbond PlusSEP, 3 M Unitek). Materials and Methods: Maxillary premolars (n= 300) were bonded on the facial surface in five groups. The INSTRON machine was used for shear bond strength testing. Statistical Analysis: Comparison of the mean rank among the groups was done by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the mean difference among groups, the Mann-Whitney test with Bon Ferroni adjustment was applied. Observations: It was observed that light-cure conventional composite resin with the conventional etchant group had the highest and glass <b>ionomer</b> <b>resin</b> adhesive had the lowest shear bond strength. There was no statistically significant difference between conventional composite used with conventional etchant and color-changing composite resin used with conventional etchant or with self-etch primer.

Ketac Nano, Vitremer, Ketac Molar Easymix and Fuji IX were analyzed using the following tests: a) agar plate diffusion test to evaluate the inhibitory activity of cements against S. mutans (n= 8); b) S. mutans adherence test by counting colony-forming units after 2 h of material/bacteria exposure (n= 10); c) biofilm wet weight after seven days of bacterial accumulation on material disks, with growth medium renewed every 48 h (n= 10); d) pH and fluoride measurements from the medium aspired at 48 h intervals during the 7 -day biofilm development (n= 10). Data from the a, b and c tests were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests and the fluoride-release and pH data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests (a= 5 %). Vitremer followed by Ketac Nano showed the greatest inhibitory zone against S. mutans than the conventional ionomers. Vitremer also showed higher pH values than Ketac Nano and Fuji IX in the first 48 h and released higher fluoride amount than Ketac Nano e Ketac Molar Easymix throughout the experimental period. The chemical composition of restorative glass ionomer materials influenced the antibacterial properties.

40|$|Objectives: To {{measure and}} compare the {{retention}} of serrated root canal posts cemented with glass <b>ionomer,</b> <b>resin</b> and resin-modified glass ionomer (hybrid) cements. Methods: Fifty single-rooted human teeth were decoronated, treated endodontically and then embedded in resin blocks. Standard post-holes, 10 mm long, were prepared to receive 1. 5 mm serrated stainless steel posts. Five equal-sized groups of roots had posts cemented using either a glass ionomer cement, one of two resin cements or one of two resin-modified glass ionomer luting cements. The cements were prepared and used according to the manufacturers' instructions. The tensile force required to dislodge the cemented posts in a testing machine was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and Mann–Whitney U-tests at the 99. 9 % confidence level. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that posts cemented with resin A were significantly better retained (340. 06 N± 23. 13 N) than those cemented with resin B (212. 56 N± 67. 62 N), or {{either of the two}} resin-modified glass ionomer cements (53. 90 N± 28. 42 N, 25. 97 N± 14. 70 N), but not statistically better than posts cemented with the glass ionomer cement (286. 16 N± 38. 71 N). The retention of posts cemented with either resin B or the glass ionomer cement was significantly better than with either hybrid cement. There {{was no significant difference in}} retention between the hybrid cements.

The {{mechanical properties}} evaluated were; flexural strength, microhardness, shear bond strength, fracture resistance and marginal integrity. The biaxial flexural strength and hardness of Turkom-Cera compared to two other allceramic systems (In-Ceram and Vitadur-N) were investigated. The Turkom-Cera exhibited significantly higher flexural strength (506. 8 MPa) than In-Ceram (347. 4 MPa) and Vitadur-N (128. 7 MPa) ceramic materials. However, In-Ceram core has significantly higher hardness (1116. 2 VHN) than Turkom-Cera (1002. 1 VHN) and Vitadur-N (812. 8 VHN) all-ceramic materials. In {{order to find}} the optimal choice of luting cement and surface treatment for Turkom- Cera all-ceramic material, the shear bond strength of four different luting cements (zinc phosphate, glass <b>ionomer,</b> <b>resin</b> modified glass ionomer and resin cement) to the Turkom-Cera all-ceramic discs was evaluated. In addition, the effect of surface treatments (no treatment as control, sandblasting, silane application and combinations of these treatments) on the shear bond strength of resin cement to Turkom-Cera was also investigated. The shear bond strength increased significantly from zinc phosphate (0. 92 MPa), glass ionomer (2. 04 MPa), resin modified glass ionoer (4. 37 MPa) to resin cement (16. 42 MPa). Sandblasting followed by silanization of the Turkom-Cera specimens provided the highest bond strength value (19. 13 MPa). The control group exhibited significantly lower shear bond strength (10. 83 MPa) than the other three groups. However, {{there were no significant}} differences in the shear bond strength of the sandblasting (16. 42 MPa), silane (16. 18 MPa) and sandblasting + silane (19. 13 MPa) groups. iii The occlusal fracture resistance of Turkom-Cera all-ceramic copings compared to Procera AllCeram and In-Ceram all-ceramic copings was evaluated using metal dies and natural teeth as a supporting structure. In both cases, using metal dies or natural teeth as a supporting structure, the mean load at fracture of Turkom-Cera (2184 N / 1341. 9 N) was significantly more than Procera (1953. 5 N / 975. 0 N) (P 0. 05). The effect of zinc phosphate, glass ionomer and resin cements on the occlusal fracture strength of Turkom-Cera all-ceramic copings were also assessed. The mean load at fracture of Turkom-Cera copings cemented with zinc phosphate, glass ionomer and resin cements were 1537. 4 N, 1294. 4 N, and 2183. 6 N, respectively. There was a significant difference in the mean load at fracture between the three luting cements used (P 0. 05). iv A preliminary prospective study to evaluate the clinical performance of Turkom-Cera crowns was conducted.

40|$|Minimal {{intervention}} {{techniques are}} generally considered {{in relation to}} initial carious lesions. However, it appears logical to apply the same principles to extensive cavities {{as well as to}} the replacement of failed existing restorations. As the cavity becomes larger, there is an increasing need to consider protection of remaining cusps because they become seriously weakened by loss of the central core of the crown and therefore become subject to the development of splits at the base. However, it is possible to develop a protective cavity design without undue sacrifice of remaining tooth structure, at the same time that maintenance of occlusal anatomy and correct contact with the opposing arch are ensured. For larger cavities, special consideration needs to be given to the strength of the restorative material. Glass ionomer is relatively brittle and should not be exposed to undue occlusal load. Resin composites cannot be regarded as universal in their physical properties, and placement is time-consuming. A lamination technique is often useful, combining the advantages of both glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> composite. Amalgam should not be entirely discarded as an option because it has greater strength than both glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> composite and is still useful for the restoration of extensive cavities and for protection and retention of weakened cusps.

The purpose of this study was determination and comparison of the mean retentive strength of cast posts with zinc phosphate, poly carboxylate, glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> cements. Methods and materials: Forty recently extracted human teeth were endodontically treated. Fore groups of 10 specimens formed. Post pattern made with acrylic resin and casting was fabricated using base metal alloy. Each group was cemented with 1 of 4 cements: Zinc phosphate, ploy carboxylate, glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> cement. Then, specimens mounted in acryl and tensile bond strength of them measured with a universal testing machine. The data analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Turkey test. Results: A significant difference between mean retentive strength of the cemented cast posts with these cements was shown (p value = 0. 06); after final assessment of Turkey test, it was appeared that the retention of posts cemented with poly carboxylate was significantly better than posts cemented with Zinc phosphate (p value = 0. 010).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{determine}} whether the vicinity of root dentine that had been restored with fluoride-releasing materials was at reduced risk for erosive/abrasive wear compared to root dentine restored with a non-fluoride-containing material. According to a randomized complete block design, standardized cavities prepared on the surface of 150 bovine root dentine slabs were restored with glass-ionomer cement, resin-modified glass <b>ionomer,</b> polyacid-modified <b>resin</b> composite, fluoride-containing or conventional composite. Specimens were coated with two layers of an acid-resistant nail varnish exposing half of the dentine surface and half of the restoration. Subsequently, specimens were either eroded in an acidic drink or left uneroded, then exposed to artificial saliva and abraded in a toothbrushing machine. Wear depth in the vicinity of restorations was quantified by a stylus profilometer, based on the nonabraded areas surrounding the erosion/abrasion region. Two-way ANOVA did not demonstrate significant interaction between restoratives and eroded-uneroded dentine (p = 0. 5549) nor significant difference among restorative materials (p = 0. 8639). Tukey`s test ascertained that the wear depth was higher for eroded than for uneroded groups. Fluoride-releasing materials seemed to negligibly inhibit wear in the vicinity of restored root dentine subjected to erosive/abrasive challenges...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjectivesImpedance {{spectroscopy}} is a non-destructive, quantitative method, {{commonly used}} nowadays for industrial research on cement and concrete. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the interest of impedance spectroscopy in the characterization of setting process of dental cements. MethodsTwo types of dental cements are used in this experiment: a new Calcium Silicate cement Biodentine™ (Septodont, Saint Maur-des Fossés, France) and a glass <b>ionomer</b> cement <b>resin</b> modified or not (Fuji II® LC Improved Capsules and Fuji IX® GP Fast set Capsules, GC Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The conductivity of the dental cements was determined by impedance spectroscopy measurements carried out on dental cement samples immersed in a 0. 1 M potassium chloride solution (KCl) in a “like-permeation” cell connected to a potentiostat and a Frequency Response Analyzer. The temperature of the solution is 37 °C. From the moment of mixing of powder and liquid, the experiments lasted 2 weeks. ResultsThe results obtained for each material are relevant of the setting process. For GIC, impedance values are stabilized after 5 days while at least 14 days are necessary for the calcium silicate based cement. SignificanceIn accordance with the literature regarding studies of cements and concrete, impedance spectroscopy can characterize ion mobility, porosity and hardening process of dental hydrogel materials...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the high}} {{velocity}} impact {{behavior of a}} dual-plate multifunctional panel composed by a carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminate and an <b>ionomer</b> thermoplastic <b>resin</b> plate is investigated experimentally. A unique characteristic of this panel {{is the ability to}} auto-repair holes generated by impacts, which is possible due to the ionomer layer. This panel is also a structural element since it includes a CFRP laminate layer. In the experimental campaign spherical aluminum projectiles with a diameter ranging from 2. 3 to 4. 5 mm were impacted against the multifunctional panel at impact velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 5 km/s and all impacts were normal to the target. Impacts occurring on the CFRP and ionomer side were investigated. The impact response of the panels discussed in this work concerns the following characteristics: debris cloud shape, damage on the witness plate, momentum transferred to the witness plate and self-healing. It was observed that when the ionomer was located on {{the back side of the}} panel it hindered the debris cloud expansion. This configuration also resulted in lower momentum transfer to the witness plate. The layers disposition had a minor effect on fragment velocity at the debris cloud tip for impact energies above 200 J. Complete self-healing of the hole occurred in all impact cases up to the projectile diameter of 3. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|Two maxillary first molars and two central incisor typhodont {{teeth were}} {{prepared}} with 0. 8 mm chamfer, 2. 0 mm occlusal reduction, and 6 degree taper. The prepared teeth were duplicated 9 times to obtain 36 die stone models and {{divided into three}} groups (n = 12). Luting agents tested were zinc phosphate, glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> cement. Procera®AllCeram 0. 6 mm coping was fixed with a calibrated finger force of 50 N. The absolute marginal discrepancy was measured using the scanning electron microscope on four axial walls with 4 measurements on each wall to obtain a total of 16 readings for one tooth. Mann Whitney U test was applied to find significant differences between luting cements and Kruskal Wallis tests among groups. Results The absolute marginal discrepancies of cements were in reducing order zinc phosphate (AZ) 53 μm; resin (AR) 44. 5 μm, glass ionomer (AG) 29 μm. There {{was a significant difference}} among luting cements AG V/s AZ (p = 0. 001) and AR V/s AG (p = 0. 003), except AR V/s AZ (p = 0. 213). All axial surfaces except mesial showed a significant difference. Conclusion The study concluded that different luting media have a definite effect over the final fit of AllCeram coping. Absolute marginal discrepancy was within the accepted level of 100 μm. Distal axial surface demonstrated a wider gap among all the luting agents...|$|R

40|$|An 8 -year-old female patient {{reported}} to the dental clinic seeking a help to save her traumatized maxillary left central incisor. The tooth had been treated with a temporary filling by a general dentist. The coronal tooth structure was intact, discolored, and a temporary filling {{was placed on the}} access opening. She gave a history of trauma about 3 years back. An intraoral periapical radiograph revealed an open apex and dentin bridge {{in the middle of the}} root canal. The root canal and the access opening were filled with very poor filling. The tooth was managed successfully by conservative means using intracanal calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament, followed by mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) filling. The access opening was filled with glass <b>ionomer</b> and composite <b>resin</b> restoration. One year and 6 -month follow-up demonstrated a clinically asymptomatic and adequately functional tooth, with radiological signs of apical regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} of zirconia-based ceramic posts (CosmoPost system) luted with glass <b>ionomer</b> and <b>resin</b> cements was evaluated. Thirty-two extracted, caries-free, unrestored teeth were selected {{and stored in}} chlorhexidine and water solution. The teeth were endodontically treated and randomly assigned to two groups (n= 16). Each tooth was decoronated and prepared {{to a depth of}} 10. 0 mm from root surface to receive a 1. 4 mm diameter zirconium dioxide post. Each group had posts cemented with either glass ionomer cement (Fuji I) or resin cement (Variolink II). The post/teeth specimens were embedded in resin blocks and subjected to tensile testing. The tensile force required to dislodge the cemented posts in a tensile testing machine was recorded. The mean stress values of both groups were analyzed for statistical differences using ANOVA and Student's t-test. Significance level was set at 5 %. Mean peak forces at failure (N) and standard deviation for the tested cements were the following: Fuji I = 121. 8 (± 17. 4) and Variolink II = 228. 1 (± 36. 8). Posts luted with the resin cement presented statistically significant higher tensile bond strength than those retained with glass ionomer (p< 0. 05). It may be concluded that zirconia posts cemented with resin-based cement (Variolink II) failed at statistically significant higher values compared to those cemented with glass ionomer cement (Fuji I). Regardless of the cement type, the posts failed adhesively at the cement/post interface when subjected to a tensile force...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the tensile strength of crowns cemented on metallic substrate with four different types of luting agents. Twenty human maxillary molars with similar diameters were selected and prepared to receive metallic core castings (Cu-Al). After cementation and preparation the cores were measured and the area of crown's portion was calculated. The teeth were divided into four groups based on the luting agent used to cement the crowns: zinc phosphate cement; glass <b>ionomer</b> cement; <b>resin</b> cement Rely X; and resin cement Panavia F. The teeth with the crowns cemented were subjected to thermocycling and later to the tensile strength test using universal testing machine with a load cell of 200 kgf and a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The load required to dislodge the crowns was recorded and converted to MPa/mm 2. Data were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis analysis with a significance level of 1 %. Panavia F showed significantly higher retention in core casts (3. 067 MPa/mm 2), when compared with the other cements. Rely X showed a mean retention value of 1. 877 MPa/mm 2 and the zinc phosphate cement with 1. 155 MPa/mm 2. Glass ionomer cement (0. 884 MPa/mm 2) exhibited the lowest tensile strength value. Crowns cemented with Panavia F on cast metallic posts and cores presented higher tensile strength. The glass ionomer cement showed the lowest tensile strength among all the cements studied...|$|R
