40|$|Ageing and dejuvenization of {{the working}} {{population}} urge us to pay directed attention to sustainable employability policy as being part of Strategic HRM. In this shortened version of my inaugural lecture, a positive psychological approach is used {{to deal with the}} possibilities both employees and working organizations have to stimulate employees to develop healthy, prosperous, challenging, and productive careers until retirement age or even after that. The strength of seniority will explicitly be focused on. Moreover, this manuscript will deal with possible threats and shortcomings that ageing workers may encounter. Given the enormous diversity in perceptions people may have towards life and career success a non-normative framework has been used. In consideration of the more pluriform working population, this contribution is structured around four career-related questions: how long do I have to go on for; <b>how</b> long <b>will</b> <b>I</b> be able to; <b>how</b> long <b>will</b> <b>I</b> be allowed to; and how long do I want to go on for...|$|R
