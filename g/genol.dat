5000|$|This {{segment is}} {{particularly}} {{involved with the}} sale of heating oil. Besides, other fuels and lubricating oils are also traded. This is the third largest portion of BayWa’s revenue and generates about 25% of the total revenue. The main articles of concern are heating oil, diesel and Otto fuels , lubricants and solid fuel generally as wood pellets. Main sales areas are Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, the new German federal states and Austria. There are sales offices at several locations. There are about 275 fuel stations {{owned and operated by}} BayWa in Germany under the name of BayWa and AVIA. Sales in Austria are done through a group holding <b>GENOL,</b> which supplies fuel to around 500 stations. The major business activities are supplying of local authorities, commerce and mineral oil trade.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the frequency and}} degree of lidocaine interference in both the first- and second-generation Kodak Ektachem 700 single-slidem thods forquantifringcreati-nine (<b>genOl</b> and genO 2) and compared these results with creatinine results from the Beckman Astra 8. The initial Kodak report had not recognized any significant interfer-ence despiteextensive studies (1). However, laterstudies showed that a lidocaine metabolite, N-ethylglycine, inter-fered in <b>genOl</b> (2). For the geno 2 method, the reaction was modified, and a purer enzyme was used. Creatinine <b>genOl</b> and gen 02 resultswere {{not significantly different from}} theAstra results for 84 critical-care patients (126 samples) who had not received lidocaine, but did differ (P < 0. 005) for 28 lidocaine-treated patients (53 samples). Figure IA illustrates the discrepancy between <b>genOl</b> an...|$|E
40|$|The  aim of this {{research}} was to know the effect phosphate dosage on a regosol soil to peanut variety growth and yield.   The research was conducted in peanut field.   It used a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) ordered faktorially and consisted of two faktor with three replication. The first faktor was the fertilizer dosage of phosphorus of 0, 125, 250 and 325 kg ha - 1 of SP 36 respectively.   The second faktor was the peanut variety of <b>genol</b> and bima variety.   The result showed that amount of phosphorus influence to growth of peanut variety, especially:  the amount of branches and leaves (8, 11 weeks after planting), dry matter (dm) of leaves, branch and all plant, dry matter of pod per plant. The phosphate dosage of 325 kg ha - 1 of SP 36 result the best of growth and yield (dm of pod per plant) peanut.  The <b>genol</b> variety of peanut have the best of amount of branch, leaves, dm leaves, branch and all plant, percentase of  flowers to pod, weigth of 100 seeds. The bima variety is only the best to amount of seed per pod and per plant...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{deterioration}} of organic and inorganic objects is a compIex process involving a relevant number of microbi al species. Particularly. fungi é 1 nd bacteria, wide spread in biosphere environments, {{are the main}} microorganisms related to the biodeterioration o[cultural property. Moreover, complex microbial communities can relcase, in indoor environments, metabolic products or other airborne particles that may be detrimenral for human health, In order lo identify the components of microbial populations colonizing surfaces of works o[art and/ or dispersed in thc aerosol of confìned/semi-confined environments, a molecular approach was laken. Samples were collected by non-destructive techniques (sterile swab, nylon membrane fragments) from surfaces of works or art and by Sartorius ponable sampler (MD 8, equipped with gelaLin sterile fìlters) from bioaerosol. :vlicrobial panicles were directly collected [rom the nylon or gelatin filters and <b>genOl</b> 11 ic microbial DN i extracted. In order to genotype the largest number o[bacteria and fungi, PCR and oligonuc 1 eotide microarray protocols were used. The target sequences, specific for prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. were 16 S rRNA. internaI transcribed spacer (ITS) and beta-tubulin gene. Thc goal was {{to set up and}} improve DNA-based proLOcols in order to identify works of art deteriogens and aerosol colonizing microorganjsms, with potential negative impact on buman health (workers/visitors) in indoor environments...|$|E
