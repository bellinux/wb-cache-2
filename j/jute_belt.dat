40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} separator for soybeans {{was developed for}} small-scale farmers in Uganda, to clean the seeds from foreign material, chaff, broken beans etc. as demanded by local and world markets. It will help to avoid losses during post-harvest time and to reduce human drudgery of cleaning the seeds manually. The principle is a <b>jute</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor of a simple construction that can be fabricated locally. For soybeans the capacity is up to 360 kg/h and separation is very good if {{the angle of the}} conveyor is about 20 degrees and the conveyor speed is about 0. 5 m/s. The separator could be used for other seeds...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{vegetative}} phase, yield components, and general {{quality of a}} variety of bast fibre crops indicates that under similar conditions these crops show differences in growth and quality parameters. Knowledge of these differences may be useful in proper selection, breeding, and improvement of any fibre crop and may also help in selecting a particular fibre crop to suit a multiple cropping programme. Some newer fibre crops have been described which may prove useful as a source of fibre outside the <b>jute</b> <b>belt.</b> Admixture of suitable bast fibres with jute may be experimented to meet the shortfall in raw jute for the industry...|$|E
