5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E
5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major <b>difference,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The Soviets did {{not simply}} {{replicate}} the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and {{was designed to}} carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. A major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 had higher turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the DT tank machine gun, {{as opposed to the}} rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun. The front part of the hull was also slightly modified.|$|E
50|$|Procedures {{resemble}} {{functions in}} <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> named program units <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> invoked repeatedly. The primary <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> functions can <b>be</b> {{used in a}} SQL statement whereas procedures cannot. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the procedure can return multiple values whereas a function should only return a single value.|$|R
2500|$|... where t denotes time. Two key <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the virial theorem relates summed {{rather than}} {{individual}} averages to each other, {{and it does}} not connect them to the temperature T. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over phase space.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sporting}} crest {{is supposed}} to be almost an exact replica of the Sporting CP but not completely. One notable <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> on Sporting Portugal's crest it says [...] "Sporting Portugal" [...] while Sporting Goa's does not. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Sporting Portugal's crest is coloured in mostly dark green and yellow while the Sporting Goa crest is darkish green and white.|$|R
5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were {{considerably}} larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very similar {{to one of the}} other types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> larger rice noodles is used instead, {{similar to}} nan gyi thoke.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> StarOffice only {{supports}} 12 languages, {{compared to}} over 110 for OpenOffice.org.|$|R
50|$|The most {{attractive}} feature of finite <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{very easy to}} implement.|$|R
5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following {{a short period}} of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule which had the unintended consequence of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Holkar {{was offered}} terms {{similar to those}} offered to Shinde; the only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Holkar {{accepted}} and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, {{an official of the}} Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware {{of the power of the}} British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past. Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> late army doctrine (and practice) {{aimed at}} avoiding open {{battle with the}} enemy if possible, unlike the early doctrine from the Principate of seeking to bring the enemy to battle as often and as quickly as possible. The main motivation was likely not a reduced ability to win such encounters. The late army continued to win {{the great majority of}} its battles with barbarians. Rather, the primary concern seemed to be the need to minimise casualties. Pitched battles generally resulted in heavy losses of high-grade comitatenses troops, which could not be easily replaced. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the late army had greater difficulty than the Principate in finding sufficient recruits, and especially high-quality recruits. The late army preferred to attack the enemy by stealth or stratagem: ambushes, surprise attacks, harassment and manoeuvres to corner the enemy in zones where they could not access supplies and from which they could not escape (e.g. by blocking mountain passes or river crossings).|$|E

5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow {{had a couple of}} months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the charioteers themselves, the aurigae, {{were considered}} to be the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and probably some money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity driver was Scorpus, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old. The most famous of all was Gaius Appuleius Diocles who won 1,462 out of 4,257 races. When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24-year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35,863,120 sesterces ($US 15 billion), making him the highest paid sports star in history. The horses, too, could become celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses.|$|E

5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying to run up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E

25|$|SuperStation WTBS {{launched}} Night Tracks on June 3, 1983, {{with up to}} 14 {{hours of}} music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985.

25|$|Bellone had 34 guns, {{including}} 24 long 8-pounder guns, {{and though}} she had more guns, her broadside was inferior to that on Lord Nelson. What made the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bellone had a crew of 260 men, versus the 102 men, exclusive of passengers, on Lord Nelson. However, Bellone also had on board some 56 prisoners from various captures.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy {{is similar}} to {{radiography}} and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) in that it generates images using X-rays. The original <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> radiography fixed still images on film whereas fluoroscopy provided live moving pictures that were not stored. However, today radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are all digital imaging modes with image analysis software and data storage and retrieval.|$|E
