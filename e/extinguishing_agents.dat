25|$|Due to poor {{visibility}} {{in the heavy}} rain, the flight crew did not see that construction equipment, including two excavators, two vibrating rollers, one small bulldozer, and one air compressor, had been parked on runway 05R. In addition, the runway contained concrete Jersey barriers and pits. About 41 seconds later, the aircraft collided with the machinery and broke into 3 major pieces. The fuselage was torn in two, and the engines and landing gear separated. A crane tore the left wing from the aircraft, forcing the jet back onto the ground. The nose struck a scoop loader. A large fire followed, destroying the forward section of the fuselage and the wings. 79 of 159 passengers and 4 of 20 crew members died in the accident. Many of the dead were seated in the middle section of the aircraft; the fuel stored in the wings exploded and sent balls of flame through that section. At 23:17:36, the emergency bell sounded and 41 fire fighting vehicles, 58 ambulances, 9 lighting units, and 436 personnel were dispatched to assist survivors and extinguish the fire. Chemical <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> rained on the aircraft at about three minutes after the impact. At 23:35, roughly 10 minutes after the impact, the fire was brought under control. At 23:40, non-airport ambulances and emergency vehicles from other agencies congregated at the north gate. At 00:00 Taipei time on 1 November, the fire was mostly extinguished and the front part of the aircraft was destroyed. Authorities established a temporary command centre.|$|E

50|$|Brominated haloalkanes {{were first}} used during World War II as fire {{extinguisher}} for aircraft and tanks. Bromochlorodifluoromethane was introduced {{as an effective}} gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid 1960s for use around highly valuable materials {{in places such as}} museums, mainframe rooms and telecommunication switching centers. They were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.|$|R

40|$|AbstractNacelle fire {{is seen as}} one of {{the most}} {{difficult}} to put out. To clarify the characteristics of fire spread in nacelle and determine the minimum usage of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent,</b> a numerical study is conducted to investigate fire activity in helicopter nacelle by analyzing the distribution of heat release rate, velocity vector field, temperature field and the distribution of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> concentration with FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator). Full scale experiment is implemented and three fire sources are set in the nacelle away from front fire wall of 1 / 4 position, 1 / 2 position and 3 / 4 position, respectively. Fire extinguishing system is designed by the results of fire spread. The distribution of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> concentration is investigated from 6 s to 10 s. Ten scenarios are studied, which are established by changing mass flow rate or injection time. The results indicate that the fire spread in nacelle is affected by the position of inlet and fire source significantly under no ventilation condition. More attention should be paid on 1 / 4 position which locates at the opposite face of inlet. In order to improve the dependability of helicopter and reduce the waste of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent,</b> minimum usage of agent is obtained.

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s {{manufacturers}} have successfully developed {{safe and effective}} Halon alternatives. These include DuPont's FM-200, American Pacific’s Halotron, FirePro's FPC Compound and 3M's Novec 1230 Fire Protection Fluid. Generally, the Halon replacement agents available today fall into two broad categories, in-kind (gaseous <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents)</b> or not in-kind (alternative technologies). In-kind gaseous agents generally fall into two further categories, halocarbons and inert gases.

5000|$|The {{extinguishing}} {{performance of}} condensed aerosol fire suppressants {{is dependent on}} the density of aerosol particulates in the immediate vicinity of the flame. As with gaseous fire suppression systems, the faster the agent can build around the flame, the more efficient the extinguishing agent will be in terminating the flame’s combustion process. The extinguishing and design densities of aerosol fire suppression agents are generally expressed in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). Thus, the efficiency of aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> varies depending on a number of factors, such as the location of the aerosol relative to the flame, the proximity of other combustible flammable materials, the type of fuel involved, etc.|$|E
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{extinguishing}} metal fires. Water and other common firefighting agents can excite metal fires and make them worse. The National Fire Protection Association recommends that metal fires be fought with dry powder <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> that work by smothering and heat absorption. The most common agents are sodium chloride granules and graphite powder. In recent years, powdered copper has also come into use. These dry powder extinguishers {{should not be confused}} with those that contain dry chemical agents. The two are not the same, and only dry powder should be used to extinguish a metal fire. Using a dry chemical extinguisher in error, in place of dry powder, can be ineffective or actually increase the intensity of a metal fire.|$|E

50|$|In such cases, it is {{necessary}} to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires {{and in the absence of}} other <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents,</b> covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there.|$|E

5000|$|These are fires whose fuel is {{flammable}} or {{combustible liquid}} or gas. The US system designates all such fires [...] "Class B". In the European/Australian system, flammable liquids are designated [...] "Class B" [...] having flash point less than 100 °F, while burning gases are separately designated [...] "Class C". These fires {{follow the same}} basic fire tetrahedron (heat, fuel, oxygen, chemical reaction) as ordinary combustible fires, except that the fuel in question is a flammable liquid such as gasoline, or gas such as natural gas. A solid stream of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. The {{most effective way to}} extinguish a liquid or gas fueled fire is by inhibiting the chemical chain reaction of the fire, which is done by dry chemical and Halon <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents,</b> although smothering with CO2 or, for liquids, foam is also effective. Halon has fallen out of favor in recent times because it is an ozone-depleting material; the Montreal Protocol declares that Halon should no longer be used.
