5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.|$|E
5|$|Mary Watts died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it of value in the present day.|$|E
5|$|On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, {{is behind the}} hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E

25|$|Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or {{overlapped}} {{to create}} second-generation subgenres.

25|$|Behavior {{prediction}} is also derived from goals. Behavior {{prediction is}} {{to acknowledge the}} likelihood that a habit will form, but in order to form that habit, a goal must have been initially present. The influence of goals on habits <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> a habit different from other automatic processes in the mind.|$|E
25|$|Mössbauer {{found that}} a {{significant}} fraction of emission and absorption events will be recoil-free, which is quantified using the Lamb–Mössbauer factor.

To learn and improve skills, Ability Points (AP) are required.|$|E
25|$|Meditations are {{reflective}} thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can {{be somewhat}} fragmented, yet their connectivity <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre {{is based on}} meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely {{on the use of}} multiple voices.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} a truss, or the height between {{the upper and}} lower chords, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it an {{efficient}} structural form. A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and material cost as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency.|$|E

It is from this chair that Sedes Chicagiensis, or See of Chicago, is {{presided over by}} the {{archbishop}} of Chicago. Unlike most Roman Catholic cathedra, the Cathedra of the See of Chicago is plain and simple. Its back contains three panels depicting the first Christian teachers: Christ in the center panel, Saint Peter to his right, and Saint Paul to his left.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{difference}} between these systems <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> analog computing useful. If one considers a simple mass–spring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is both complicated and expensive.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre {{became the}} capital city of the province, when the {{administration}} of Manuel Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants {{from all over the world}} started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese. This mosaic of diversity in appearance, ethnic origin, religions and languages <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> Porto Alegre, nowadays with nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, a cosmopolitan and multicultural city. The city is an example of diversity and plurality.|$|E
25|$|The Mohist {{philosophers}} {{believed that}} the purpose of life was universal, impartial love. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring - a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her. The expression of this indiscriminate caring <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.|$|E
