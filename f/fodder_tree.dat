25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a <b>fodder</b> <b>tree.</b> The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

40|$|Diversity, {{pastoral}} {{and conservation}} priorities of <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> in the Sudano-Guinean pasture lands of Benin. Description of the subject. <b>Fodder</b> <b>trees</b> {{are important for}} livestock survival in dryland Africa. In view of the pressure faced by these trees, and their consequent rarity noted in rangelands, a {{study was conducted in}} the Sudano-Guinean transition zone of Benin {{at the level of the}} local population surrounding the protected forests of Monts Kouffé, Wari-Maro and Ouémé Supérieur. Objectives. This study aimed to inventory the <b>fodder</b> <b>trees,</b> analyze the local perception of factors threatening target <b>fodder</b> <b>trees,</b> according to different sociolinguistic groups and prioritize <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> for conservation. Method. Ethnobiological surveys and ecological data from the available literature were used to construct a database following different criteria. The citation rates of the <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> by the surveyed populations were used to establish pastoral priority, while their conservation priority was established using a combination of four methods and nine criteria. Results. Forty-eight <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> belonging to 17 families dominated by Leguminosae (27. 1 %) and Moraceae (16. 6 %) were reported. These species were distributed among 37 genera, with the genus Ficus being the most represented (16. 6 %). Palatability, species availability and the impact of <b>tree</b> <b>fodder</b> on animal productivity were the criteria used by the surveyed sociolinguistic groups in their selection of <b>fodder</b> <b>trees.</b> The prioritization methods yielded ten top ranked species: Afzelia africana, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Khaya senegalensis, Vitellaria paradoxa, Mangifera indica, Ficus platyphylla, Balanites aegyptiaca, Annona senegalensis, Ficus umbellata and Daniellia oliveri. Conclusions. With the aim of establishing the sustainable management of pasture lands, we suggest that priority be given to the aforementioned species of <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> as part of restoration, afforestation/reforestation and plantation activities...|$|R

50|$|Wilga is {{a useful}} shade and <b>fodder</b> <b>tree</b> in {{agricultural}} areas. Sheep particularly enjoy grazing on the lower branches, although trees appear to vary greatly in palatability (some are eagerly sought after and others ignored). The reason for this variation is unknown, and soil composition is speculated as a cause. Despite being slow growing, it is planted in Australia and overseas as an ornamental. It prefers full sunshine, and can tolerate the occasional light frost and drought. Indigenous Australians chewed the aromatic leaves for alleviating toothache.|$|E

30|$|The {{adaptability}} of the <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> {{and shrubs}} vary since some species had a narrow zone of availability whereas others persist within multiple ecological niches. Annual fodder yields vary from 20 to 400 kg fresh leaves per tree, depending on age, species, lopping patterns and management pattern. Some <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> are lopped and fed fresh, whereas others are harvested and piled for winter feeding. Some <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> are preferred by farmers for {{their effects on}} milk production in terms of quantity and fat content (Devendra, 1989).|$|R
30|$|Different {{social groups}} occupying {{the study area}} have unequal access to <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs.

40|$|Previous work {{in animal}} {{nutrition}} {{has focused on}} single feeds and assumed additivity in ration systems. In the tropics, farmers are likely to feed mixtures of feeds, including tree fodders, {{which may not be}} simply additive in nutritional terms. This study has increased our understanding of the mechanisms that determine the associative effects on the in vitro fermentation of mixtures of <b>fodder</b> <b>tree</b> leaves. Associative effects are governed by a synchronisation in the fermentation rates of the components of the mixture. This is in turn dependent on the fermentability of their chemical constituents. Effects were demonstrated by changes in the fermentation kinetics of gas production curves. The chemical components of <b>fodder</b> <b>tree</b> leaves that affect the fermentation, and the time at which the effect occurs, were identified, using two media of different nitrogen contents. The fermentation of mixtures of pure chemical entities in various combinations was then examined. The greatest associative effects were found when the mixture had components of similar fermentability. It is proposed that associative effects are a function of the synchronisation of fermentation of the different components and was shown to occur at the point when the rate was maximal. With two types of protein (casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA)), utilisation of a protein by rumen microbes was shown to be a function of its fermentability and not of its solubility. This is also influenced by the type of associated carbohydrate. <b>Fodder</b> <b>tree</b> leaves were then combined with different pure chemical entities. Associative effects between <b>fodder</b> <b>tree</b> leaves and carbohydrates were shown to occur and the responses were similar to those obtained with mixtures of pure carbohydrates and proteins. The effect of tannins and phenolic compounds was studied using quebracho tannin as a model, and in five of the tree species. They were shown to affect the fermentability of both carbohydrates and proteins. The effect was greater with carbohydrates of medium to low fermentability. They also reacted with both soluble and insoluble protein. Forages with phenolic compounds showed both positive and negative effects. The effects were possible due to a synchrony or asynchrony in the release of protein. In mixtures of leaves from different species, associative effects were related to their fermentability. Again, this appeared {{to be the result of}} the synchronisation of the release of nutrients. Associative effects with <b>fodder</b> <b>tree</b> leaves were of a composite nature and can be both positive and negative. The implications of these findings in relation to in vivo digestion and animal production are discussed. Due to the diversity of fodder trees, there is the potential to develop feeding systems based on mixtures which make better use of available resources. This will also contribute to improved efficiency in the management and use of natural resources, and take advantage of natural plant diversity in the tropics. </p...|$|E

30|$|Subsistence famers usually include {{trees as}} an output product of their farm, {{whether it is}} for wood, shade, soil conservation, or fodder (Zomer et al., 2009). Herders rely on <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> in the dry season because the foliage retains {{sufficient}} crude protein, minerals and energy due to the deep root systems of these species (Speedy and Pugliese, 1992; Paterson et al., 1998; Upreti and Shresta, 2006). The landless mobile herders described in this study (see methodology for further description) mainly depend on naturally grown <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs. In arid and semi arid zones {{like those of the}} Sahel, tree feed resources growing near villages, roadsides and communal lands contribute up to 80 % of the protein during the dry spells (Speedy and Pugliese, 1992).|$|R

40|$|Fodder tree/shrub legumes {{have the}} {{potential}} for alleviating some of the feed shortages and nutritional deficiencies experienced in the dry season on smallholder farms. Zambia has a wide range of naturally occurring tree/shrub species that can be used as fodder for ruminants. Over the years a number of trees have been selected for their agronomic qualities and are currently being used in arable farming systems to promote soil fertility and erosion control. There is a need to evaluate them for use as fodder for ruminants in the dry season. Because of their high content of protein, minerals and vitamins and availability in the dry season, fodder tree/shrub legumes have the capacity to complement the feeding of crop-residues and natural pastures. Tree/shrub legumes also have other advantages in that they are available on-farm and can also be used as a source of food, timber and medicines at village level. Being deep rooted, <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> are rarely affected by seasonal climatic changes. The main limitation to their use as a feed resource for ruminants is the high tannin content which may have detrimental effects on the performance of animals. A number of techniques including, wilting, sun-drying, treatment with chemicals and ammoniation have been developed to minimize their adverse effects. Controlled intake through stall feeding or mixing of tree/shrub fodder with basal diets could also be used to mitigate their toxic effects. Research is currently under way to establish rumen microbes that have capacity to detoxify tannins. To promote increased use of <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> on smallholder farms, farmers must be provided with information on the good quality <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> and the approaches to effectively utilise them. They should also be encouraged to start planting <b>fodder</b> <b>trees</b> in their food crop farming systems or establishing fodder gardens on fallow lands...|$|R
