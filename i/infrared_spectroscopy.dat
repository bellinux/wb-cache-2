5|$|In 1985, almost 150 {{years after}} the Byne's disease was first {{mentioned}} in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as X-Ray diffraction, <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, finally revealed {{the true nature of}} the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the calcium salts), as well as the chemical reactions that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.|$|E

5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both near and far <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by {{a sharp decline in}} 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Ariel by <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere. Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite, and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} energetic charged particles coming from Uranus's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Ariel's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon.|$|E

40|$|In {{the forest}} {{products}} industry, improved methods {{are needed for}} rapid analysis of wood and paper products. Currently, the best methods for determining chemical and physical properties of wood-based materials require considerable sample preparation and analysis time. Consequently, quantitative information is often not obtained on a time scale suitable for process monitoring, control, and quality assurance. The primary barriers to practical utilization of conventional infrared methods are the opaqueness and poor reflection properties of the wood-based materials. This paper demonstrates how photoacoustic and transient <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> have been combined with chemometric techniques to overcome the limitations of conventional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> and to permit rapid chemical and physical characterization of wood chips. Both photoacoustic and transient infrared spectroscopic methods are examined as rapid at- and on-line techniques for feedstock identification and chemical composition analysis prior to processing...|$|R

25|$|As with {{two-dimensional}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (2DNMR) spectroscopy, this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allows for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR, nonlinear two-dimensional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> also involves the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR, two distinct techniques, COSY and NOESY, are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first {{are related to the}} scalar coupling, while in the latter they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In nonlinear two-dimensional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. Nonlinear two-dimensional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY, and nonlinear two-dimensional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY.
