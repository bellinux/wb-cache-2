25|$|The patroonships were {{precisely}} feudal: no colonists of a patroonship {{could leave}} the colony during their term of service without the written consent of the patroon, and the West India Company pledged itself to do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> power to apprehend and deliver up all fugitives from the patroon's service.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Boom Box {{received}} very little coverage from music critics {{because it was}} not a studio album. The few reviews it received were positive. The album charted at number 206 on the Top Internet Albums. However, <b>in</b> <b>its</b> separate release, The Singles 1992–2003 was reviewed widely and positively, and it charted highly across North America and Europe, peaking at number 2 in the US and number 5 <b>in</b> the UK. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> Time, <b>in</b> <b>its</b> separate release, charted on the US Billboard 200 at number 182.|$|R

25|$|Because of {{his senior}} status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played {{significant}} roles in the Iran-Contra Affair and {{was in a position}} to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries.|$|E

At the same time it refused to pay certain invoices and entered into litigation with many of its suppliers to delay as many payments as possible. It was the performance of the advertising department, however, that most concerned the board during the difficult period which followed the launching of the daily newspaper.|$|E

Tornado occurring in a straight line, swept through <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> path, bearing thunder in the clouds. Bright lightning rendered the darkness, and the waters of the heavens first littered by the wind, splashed in every direction, before turning into regular, refreshing and nourishing showers.|$|E

25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern {{and the whole thing}} is supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that the game is played fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything {{in the path of the}} Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop the Sway destroying <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> path.|$|E

In March, the South Eastern Railway Bill had its second reading in Parliament. Sir Charles Russell, MP stated that the South Eastern Railway (SER) had done <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> power to obstruct the English Channel Steamship Company. Lord Elcho stated that if the railway was sincere in its desire to improve communication with the continent (the stated aim of the bill), then it would run its trains to suit Castalia, rather than expecting the ship to run to suit its trains. After some discussion, the bill passed its second reading. Sir Edward Watkin was asked about this state of affairs at a shareholders meeting of the SER on 3 August. He replied that the railway could not run a special and regular service of trains to meet an irregular sailing schedule such as that operated by Castalia, which did not run in the winter. The boats that connected with the SERs trains operated a regular, year-round service.|$|E

The visual design of the Chieftains was later modified for Halo 3, with the seasoned warriors sporting more elaborate headdresses and shoulder pads. In {{a review of the}} character, UGO Networks noted that whereas the Elites [...] "are a precision scalpel," [...] Tartarus was a [...] "baseball bat" [...] that smashes <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> path, a reference to their ceremonial weapons, the Energy Sword and Gravity Hammer, respectively.|$|E

[...] Columbia Journalism Review concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Godwin shows, this strong response laid the groundwork for lawsuits that enabled the Supreme Court to declare the 'decency' amendment unconstitutional. He was in the thick of things throughout this effort, and his journal lets the reader relive the tension and uncertainty of trying to halt a media stampede before it crushed <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> path." ...|$|E
