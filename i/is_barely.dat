5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> visible today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E

5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens a gym in the building, which intrigues Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who's {{been looking}} to lose weight. However, Dwight's gym is only filled with his farming {{equipment}} as exercising equipment. Darryl says he needs actual equipment, which Dwight finally gets, but sees that Darryl <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> using it. Dwight asks more employees to join to help motivate Darryl to exercise harder. During a bench-press, Dwight refuses to spot Darryl unless {{he says his}} motivation to work out. Darryl finally says it is to impress the new female warehouse worker Val.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> discernible from the distance as a man-made structure. The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many military operations. During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, {{to keep up with}} the development of arms. The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E

To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his own small club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.|$|E
5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> able to stop herself, although she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E
5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites {{in the state of}} Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

5|$|The {{siege of}} Kamacha by the Abbasid Caliphate {{took place in}} autumn 766, and {{involved}} the siege of the strategically important Byzantine fortress of Kamacha on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river, {{as well as a}} large-scale raid across eastern Cappadocia by a part of the Abbasid invasion army. Both enterprises failed, with the siege dragging on into winter before being abandoned and the raiding force being surrounded and heavily defeated by the Byzantines. The campaign {{was one of the first}} large-scale Abbasid operations against Byzantium, and is one of the few campaigns of the Arab–Byzantine wars for which detailed information survives, although it <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> mentioned in Arabic or in Byzantine sources.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in lampreys, and hagfish, the cerebellum <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the cerebellum by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part of the story, which starts {{immediately}} after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) {{are all the same}} in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E
