25|$|Boeing sought other {{companies}} to be risk-sharing partners to reduce development costs. In November 2010, Boeing {{signed an agreement}} with Korea Aerospace Industries for KAI to design and manufacture the F-15SE's CWB. KAI had previously produced wings and <b>forward</b> <b>fuselages</b> for F-15K and F-15SG. On January 2012, the Korea Times reported that only 10% of the design work on the CWB had been completed, and that development of the canted vertical tails had been suspended in 2010. However, Boeing had stated that development continued with scale model wind tunnel tests scheduled for spring 2012.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was {{upgraded}} and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) {{with an additional}} hardpoint under the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> and another two inboard pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing {{to a total of}} seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As a result of these upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force's aerobatic team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.|$|E
5|$|Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer {{designed}} and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the canards and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it had a different fly-by-wire flight-control system to accommodate the canards. The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB {{was designed to be}} fully combat-capable.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles for self-defense.|$|E

50|$|Dassault's {{production}} facilities {{proved to be}} unable to attain the rate of production necessary {{to keep pace with}} the domestic orders, in part due to a lack of time to refine the Ouragan's design to make it easier to mass-produce; accordingly, portions of the work were subcontracted to other French aircraft manufacturers. A manufacturing arrangement was formed with SNCASE to assemble <b>forward</b> <b>fuselages</b> for the aircraft at their Toulouse factory, while a similar agreement with SNCASO led to the firm manufacturing rear fuselages at Saint-Nazaire and wings in Bouguenais. Dassault's factories continued to produce the center fuselage and tail units, while final assembly was carried out at Dassault's facility in Mérignac, Gironde.|$|R
2500|$|... 6 – RB-57D Model 294 (53-3977 to 53-3982) – (Group A) Basic {{configuration}} {{built as}} single-seat aircraft. The primary mission of these aircraft was high-altitude photo reconnaissance. There were four reconnaissance cameras (two K38 and two KC1) {{mounted in the}} <b>forward</b> lower <b>fuselage.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5|$|The trainer {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> {{features}} a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in chord (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E
5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The 9.25 m span wide (30 ft) centre section, the {{structural}} {{core of the}} DB-70, was based on four steel transverse spars, separated vertically by 2.30 m (7 ft 6 in), horizontally by 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) and cross-braced into six frames, forming five transverse bays. The two pairs of outer frames defined the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselages</b> and the outer wings, engines and undercarriage legs were attached to the outermost frames. The centre engine was mounted on the central frame, positioned well forward of both the leading edge and of the planes of the two outer propellers. The whole structure was duralumin skinned to form an aerofoil section with a chord of about 10 m (33 ft), the lower surface continuing to form the undersides of the fuselages.|$|R
50|$|PIK 20D added {{conventional}} Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, carbon reinforcement strips at critical {{locations in}} the fuselage, the nose profile was sharpened, the tail-plane was moved <b>forward</b> and <b>fuselage</b> fairings recontoured to reduce drag. The flaps were limited to -12 to +20 degrees. The first flight of the D was in 1976.|$|R
50|$|In {{the lower}} atmosphere, the orbiter flies {{much like a}} {{conventional}} glider, except for a much higher descent rate, over 50 m/s or 9,800 fpm. At approximately Mach 3, two air data probes, located {{on the left and}} right sides of the orbiter's <b>forward</b> lower <b>fuselage,</b> are deployed to sense air pressure related to the vehicle's movement in the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage</b> section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the <b>forward</b> <b>fuselage.</b> The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
5|$|F-22 Flying Testbed – {{the first}} 757 built {{was used in}} 1998 as a testbed for Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor {{avionics}} and sensor integration. The Boeing-owned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighter's wing sensor layout, along with a <b>forward</b> F-22 <b>fuselage</b> section with radar and other systems, and a 30-seat laboratory with communication, electronic warfare, identification, and navigation sensors.|$|R
50|$|It had fixed {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 2.4 m. The mainwheels, equipped with brakes, were independently mounted on bent axles hinged {{from the central}} fuselage and restrained by drag struts from the <b>forward</b> lower <b>fuselage</b> frames. Each wheel had a short, vertical oleo strut from the forward part of the outer end of the wing centre-section. The tailwheel castored and was sprung and damped with rubber rings.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} {{that two of the}} victims of the Lockerbie bombing survived for a brief period after hitting the ground (with the <b>forward</b> nose section <b>fuselage</b> in freefall mode), but died from their injuries before help arrived.|$|R
