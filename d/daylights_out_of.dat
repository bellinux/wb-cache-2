500|$|Millennium Force {{has one of}} {{the longest}} lines in the park, with {{passengers}} waiting over four hours when the ride debuted. The ride received positive reactions from visitors, many of whom said it was smooth and very comfortable. Others said, [...] "It'll scare the <b>daylights</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you". In its first six years of operation, Millennium Force had over 10 million riders. By August 2012, Millennium had given more than 21 million rides. Several television shows, including the Travel Channel's Extreme Terror Rides, Bert the Conqueror, Off Limits, the Discovery Channel's Extreme Rides, and the National Geographic Channel's Super Coasters have featured Millennium Force. Out of over 500 roller coasters that Werner Stengel has engineered, he stated that Millennium Force is his favorite. Robb Alvey, a notable roller coaster enthusiast, called it a [...] "milestone in roller coaster history".|$|E

It {{was the subject}} of a ten-page feature by Kieron Gillen in PC Gamer UK, the first and only article {{dedicated}} to a single level in that magazine. Gillen hailed it as [...] "one of the most brilliant and disturbing levels ever committed to PC", and he believed that it was [...] "probably the scariest level ever made". Tom McNamara of IGN wrote that the level [...] "just has to be experienced to be believed", and he praised its sound design. He considered the level to be a high point of Deadly Shadows. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called the level [...] "remarkable" [...] and [...] "nerve-wracking", and IGN's Shunal Doke noted in a retrospective feature that the level's audiovisuals combine to [...] "scare the living <b>daylights</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you".

[...] "Is She the Reason" [...] is an R ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song [...] "I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To". The next song, [...] "Girl" [...] was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. [...] "If", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. [...] "Free" [...] {{was described as a}} [...] "soul classic from 1975" [...] with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being [...] "set free" [...] after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number [...] "Through with Love" [...] was noted for having an [...] "angry" [...] nature as it talks about a break-up.

It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night.

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living <b>daylights</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{reference}} to the interior splendor of Roman churches, I must say that I think it a pity that painted windows are exclusively a Gothic ornament; for the elaborate ornamentation of these interiors puts the ordinary <b>daylight</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> countenance, so that a window with only the white sunshine coming through it, or even with {{a glimpse of the}} blue Italian sky, looks like a portion left unfinished, and therefore a blotch in the rich wall. It is like the one spot in Aladdin's palace which he left for the king, his father-in-law, to finish, after his fairy architects had exhausted their magnificence on the rest; and the sun, like the king, fails in the effort. It has what is called a porta santa, which we saw walled up, in front of the church, one side of the main entrance. I know not what gives it its sanctity, but it appears to be opened by the pope on a year of jubilee, once every quarter of a century.|$|R

5000|$|In 1935, Fellows {{appeared}} in Gregory La Cava's She Married Her Boss (1935) as Melvyn Douglas's deceitful daughter who is tamed when Claudette Colbert [...] "spanks the <b>daylight</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her" [...] with a hairbrush. Her performance landed her a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures {{and she became}} a star {{at the age of}} twelve. With her first Columbia films—One-Way Ticket, And So They Were Married, and Tugboat Princess—she continued to be typecast as the orphan or street urchin. In the fall of 1936, her popularity was helped significantly by her co-starring role opposite Bing Crosby in Pennies from Heaven, playing a tough, precocious orphan protected by Crosby's singing vagabond. Whereas in previous films her robust character was tamed by a swift spanking, in this film she is [...] "soothed by the crooning of Crosby, particularly the title song sung to her during a thunderstorm." [...] In his review in The New York Times, Frank S. Nugent singled out Fellows's performance writing: The chief honors properly belong to little Miss Fellows. Hers really is an exceptional performance for a youngster, skirting the perils of bathos in her tender scenes and playing her rebellious ones with comic impertinence.|$|R
