People may see suicide as a glamorous ending, with the young person or elderly person <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> lots of sympathy, and lots of national concern that they never got in life. The second possible factor is that vulnerable youth may feel like, [...] "If they couldn't cut it, neither can I". Increased rate of suicides has been shown to occur up to ten days after a television report. Studies in Japan and Germany have replicated findings of an imitative effect. Etzersdorfer et al. in an Austrian study showed a strong correlation between the number of papers distributed in various areas and the number of subsequent firearm suicides in each area after a related media report. Higher rates of copycat suicides have been found in those with similarities in race, age, and gender to the victim in the original report.|$|E

5000|$|Reflecting {{upon his}} time in Anthrax, Turbin has explained: [...] "Even though I have no regrets about doing Fistful Of Metal or the first tour, there was nothing {{pleasant}} in any aspect about it.

And there weren’t lots of song ideas coming from him. This was my agenda: I was there to rock. I came there to kick some ass and thrash. Scott admitted {{to the rest of the}} band that bassist Dan Lilker had to be let go, but it was a lot easier for him to use me as a scapegoat, especially after I wasn’t there anymore. Everybody knew that Dan just wasn’t cutting it on a number of levels. He took thirty takes to play the Alice Cooper cover [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] in the studio. But there was this great resentment because I was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> so I was completely undermined. I was foolish because I decided to weather the storm.

5000|$|The Bowmont sheep [...] is an {{extremely}} rare breed that was bred in the 1980s {{to create a new}} high quality fibre, by crossing a Saxon Merino with a Shetland. This project was undertaken by the Macaulay Institute {{in order to create a}} breed of sheep intended as a UK rival to the fine wool of the merino sheep in New Zealand and Australia. In 2006 due to lack of funding the Macaulay Institute closed their research farm after 25 years just when the sheep were becoming consistent and the breed stabilising. At this time there wasn’t a large enough market for the fine wool so many of the sheep got either slaughtered or cross bred, creating a less luxurious fibre. Finisterre have teamed up with Lesley Prior at Devon Fine Fibres, the only keeper of purebred Bowmont sheep, to rescue the breed from the brink of extinction, create a sustainable market for the wool and aid in the breed’s development and keeping them alive. With the help of clever promotional material and viral videos [...] the project is <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> from the likes of Prince Charles and Savile Row [...] with a large interest in the sustainability of producing high quality, fine wool in the UK. The Bowmont will be the finest wool sheep in Europe; only being challenged by the merino in further afield parts of the world.|$|E
