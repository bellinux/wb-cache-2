5000|$|<b>Excerebration</b> is an Egyptian mummification {{procedure}} of {{removal of the}} brain from corpses prior to actual embalming. Greek writer Herodotus, a frequent visitor to Egypt wrote in the fifth century B.C. about the process [...] "Having agreed on a price, the bearers go away, and the workmen, left alone in their place, embalm the body. If they {{do this in a}} perfect way, they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest".|$|E
50|$|This {{process was}} {{available}} for anyone who could afford it. It was believed that even {{those who could not}} afford this process could still enjoy the afterlife with the right reciting of spells. The most classic and common method of mummification dates back to the 18th Dynasty. The first step was to remove the internal organs and liquid so that the body would not decay. The embalmers took out the brain through a process named <b>excerebration</b> by inserting a sharp object in the nostril, breaking through it into the brain and then liquefying it. They threw out the brain because they thought that the heart did all the thinking. The next step was to remove the internal organs, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines, and place them in canopic jars with lids shaped like the heads of the protective deities, the four sons of Horus. The heart stayed in the body, because in the hall of judgment it would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at. After the body was washed with wine, it was stuffed with bags of natron. The dehydration process took 40 days.|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} sensational and best-known feature of Egyptian mummification, {{the removal of}} the brain, is {{commonly}} attributed to the New Kingdom onward (e. g. [1]). Variability both within and between <b>excerebration</b> techniques, however, is poorly appreciated in the literature [2], and reporting of <b>excerebration</b> is often inconsistent, greatly simplified, or simply absent in descriptions of mummified remains, making detailed comparative studies difficult if not impossible. The goals of this study were to demonstrate: variability in mummy <b>excerebration</b> techniques temporal and status trends in brain treatment the limitations of the literature for large studies This study focuses on computed tomography (CT), as a non-destructive gold standard for mummies studies, in the examination of three primary treatments of the brain in mummification: transnasal craniotomy (TNC) transforaminal craniotomy (TFC) the absence of <b>excerebration</b> in relation to their radiological indications and their variations with time and status...|$|E
40|$|Egyptian mummification and funerary rituals were a {{transformative}} process, {{making the}} deceased a pure being; free of disease, injury, and disfigurements, {{as well as}} ethical and moral impurities. Consequently, the features of mummification available to specific categories of individuals hold social and ideological significance. This study refutes long-held classical stereotypes, particularly dogmatic class associations; demonstrates the apocryphal nature of universal heart retention; and expands on the purposes of <b>excerebration</b> and evisceration implied by synthetic and radiological analyses. Features of the embalming traditions, specifically the variable <b>excerebration</b> and evisceration traditions, represented the Egyptian view of death. Fine-grain analyses, through primary imaging data for these traditions, have recently been made possible {{on a large scale}} through the development of a radiological mummy database. The IMPACT Radiological Mummy Database is a multi-institutional, collaborative research project devoted to the scientific study of mummified remains through primary data from medical imaging modalities. This first application of IMPACT addresses the evolution of Egyptian <b>excerebration</b> and evisceration, and how suites of features in mummies of differing age, sex, status, and location differ and how they relate to the fate of the recipientâ€™s afterlife and to sociopolitical and ideological changes and interactions...|$|E
40|$|Variability {{in brain}} treatment, {{as a part}} of the Egyptian mummification process, is poorly {{appreciated}} in the literature, as variability in the details of <b>excerebration</b> have not been addressed comprehensively nor with respect to social, geographic, and temporal variation. The description of Egyptian mummification commonly used in the popular and academic literature is derived largely from accounts by Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. However, this normative description does not acknowledge the existence of a wide range of mummification techniques practiced and so stifles the study of geographic and chronological changes in the practice and their causes. Therefore, the goal of this study is to use the classical description as a hypothesis for empirical testing, using published literature and primary radiographic data, with a specific focus on the practice of <b>excerebration.</b> Three primary treatments of the brain in mummification, and their variation over time and across social strata, are discussed in relation to their treatment in the literature, their radiological indicators, and their technical considerations. In order to examine Egyptian mummy <b>excerebration,</b> this study makes use of two samples: (1) a literature-based sample of 125 mummies, and (2) a sample of 6 mummies examined directly using computed tomography. In spite of an apparent high degree of variability, the literature continues to focus on modern and classical stereotypes rather than the rich variability in the Egyptian mummification tradition. Detailed, large-scale examination of this and other mummification traditions, and their meanings, is required to further our understanding of this important early complex society...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Systematic facial mutilations during mummification {{have never}} been {{described}} before. The purpose of this work was to study a wrapped mummified head using high-resolution CT scanning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An isolated mummified head from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom was scanned at 200 m isotropic resolution. A prototype flat panel CT scanner was used to generate 800 nonoverlapping CT sections at 120 kV and 50 mA. This dataset was analyzed to discern various surgical alterations during mummification. RESULTS: There were large defects in the cribriform plate and the posterior fossa. Systematic mutilations of the facial bones and mandible, involving the anterior and inferior walls of the maxillary sinuses, the floor of both orbits, and the zygomatic arches with contiguous segments of the zygomas, were demonstrated. The coronoid processes of both mandibles had been sharply excised and the articular tubercles of the temporomandibular joints fractured. CONCLUSION: Defects in the ethmoid and the posterior skull base are consistent with previous descriptions of <b>excerebration.</b> Mutilations of the facial skeleton and jaw, which are unrelated {{to the process of}} <b>excerebration,</b> {{have never been}} described previously. It is noteworthy that the osteotomie...|$|E
40|$|The IMPACT (Internet-based Mummy Picture Archive and Communication Technology) Radiological Mummy Database Project is {{designed}} to provide mummy and medical researchers with a large-scale comparative database of medical imaging of mummified human remains. This departure from a case-study model for mummy studies will drive the field towards a large-scale comparative and epidemiological paradigm. The Canadian team will be investigating the evisceration and <b>excerebration</b> components of the Egyptian mummification tradition, and the US teams will apply the database to a greatly expanded study of atherosclerosis in ancient Egyptian mummies, as part of the IMPACT Ancient Health Research Group, and to the refinement of a novel system of diagnosis by consensus for mummified remains...|$|E
40|$|Two {{artificial}} mummies {{found in}} the hospital church of S. Maria della Scala in Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) and dated back {{to the end of}} the 15 th century, were examined. The mummies, in good state of preservation and still wearing their Renaissance clothes, were identified as the rector of the hospital, named Salimbene Capacci, and his wife, Margherita Sozzini. Imaging studies, X-rays and CAT were performed. Autopsy made it possible to ascertain that the bodies had been eviscerated by a longitudinal cut from the neck to the pubis and that the thoracic and abdominal cavities had been filled with vegetable material. The pelvis was not eviscerated and the pelvic organs were conserved. The skull showed no traces of craniotomy or <b>excerebration...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{artificial}} mummy of the Blessed Christine (c. 1432 - 1458) from Spoleto (Umbria, central Italy) showed a young, very obese women, with an anthropological age of 20 - 25 years and a stature of 1. 45 m. The body was eviscerated by a transversal cut {{at the bottom of}} the neck, a jugulo-epigastric incision, with longitudinal section of the sternum, and a semicircular incision of the epigastric region. <b>Excerebration</b> was obtained by an ovoidal opening of 6 x 3. 5 cm in the squama of the occipital bone. Finally the body was defleshed by several incisions in the arms and limbs and the body cavities were filled with a sort of padding mixed with powder plants, with no suture. We are in the presence of a very complex embalming method, which witnesses a long-practised and diffused custom...|$|E
