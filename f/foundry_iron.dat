5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell <b>Foundry.</b> <b>Iron</b> bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E

50|$|During the 17th century, iron was an used to {{manufacture}} {{a number of}} indispensable goods, including nails, horseshoes, cookware, tools, and weapons. The production of iron required a complex manufacturing process, which was not available {{during the early years}} of the North American colonization. Thus, all of the colonists iron goods had to be imported. As it took at least two months to sail to the nearest <b>foundry,</b> <b>iron</b> goods were very expensive.|$|E

5000|$|Kulti Works of IISCO {{had grown}} {{to be a major}} foundry complex in stages. The light {{castings}} foundry was established in 1875, general castings shop in 1915, non-ferrous foundry in 1948, steel foundry and heavy mechanised foundry in 1958. The spun pipe plants (three in number) came up in 1944, 1958 and 1981. The iron making facilities were closed down at Kulti in 1958 and it was decided to supply <b>foundry</b> <b>iron</b> in liquid form from Burnpur. Thus the curtain came down on 83-year long tradition of iron making at Kulti.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cast iron}} sulfur {{promotes}} {{the formation of}} white iron. As little as 0.5% can counteract the effects of slow cooling and a high silicon content [...] White cast iron is more brittle, but also harder.

At {{the end of the}} 19th century, the C. Blumwe and Son firm had branches in Berlin, Magdeburg and Cologne. Production was shipped throughout Europe, and even to China, United States and Africa. In 1899, the factory employed 22 managers and 250 workers. At its climax, the firm also owned additional plots on the northern side of Nakielska street, in front of the factory, used as storing area.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{principal}} {{works in}} north Wales, generally {{known as the}} Ruabon works, were located at Acrefair, near Wrexham, Denbighshire. An ironworks was established here in c1817 by Edward Lloyd Rowland. Following his bankruptcy in 1822 the works were idle until bought by the British Iron Company in 1825 for nearly £135,000 (which included {{the purchase of the}} Newbridge works). There were three furnaces, forges and mills which supplied <b>foundry</b> <b>iron</b> chiefly to the Manchester market. From about 1875 the production of iron was spasmodic until the final closure of the works in December 1887. The company also had collieries in the area, including Acrefair, Plas Benion and Wynnstay (or the Green Pit). Following the withdrawal of the New British Iron Company from this district the collieries were taken over by the Wynnstay Collieries Company.|$|E

50|$|The springs were {{partially}} dammed in the 1750s {{to provide}} water power for iron production, with raw materials of iron ore, timber and limestone plentiful {{in the neighboring}} mountains. The Carlisle Iron Works was in full production by the 1760s, and a grist mill was built {{at the end of}} the lake in 1762. While the <b>foundry's</b> <b>iron</b> was probably used to make ammunition and weapons for the Continental Army, no cannons were made.|$|R
50|$|Iron {{produced}} at the Crane Iron Company {{was used in}} a number of products, many of which were made elsewhere in Catasauqua.

5000|$|Birmingham {{was founded}} on June 1, 1871 by real estate {{promoters}} who sold lots near the planned crossing of the Alabama & Chattanooga and South & North railroads. The site was notable for the nearby deposits of iron ore, coal and limestone—the three principal raw materials used in making steel. Its founders adopted the name of England's principal industrial city to advertise the new city as a center of iron and steel production. Despite outbreaks of cholera, the population of this 'Pittsburgh of the South' grew from 38,000 to 132,000 from 1900 to 1910, attracting rural white and black migrants {{from all over the}} region. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed [...] "The Magic City." [...] By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S and held more than 30% {{of the population of the}} state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy. Chemical and structural constraints limited the quality of steel produced from Alabama's iron and coal. These materials did, however, combine to make ideal <b>foundry</b> <b>iron.</b> Because of low transportation and labor costs, Birmingham quickly became the largest and cheapest foundry iron-producing area. By 1915, twenty-five percent of the nation's foundry pig iron was produced in Birmingham.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} Industrial Revolution major uses of iron demanded good local ore and {{established}} processing skills for iron strength, qualities found in Rotherham's smelting plants and <b>foundries.</b> <b>Iron,</b> and later steel, became the principal industry in Rotherham, surviving into the 20th century. The Walker family built an {{iron and steel}} empire in the 18th century, their foundries producing high quality cannon, including some for the ship of the line HMS Victory, and cast iron bridges, {{one of which was}} commissioned by Thomas Paine.|$|R
