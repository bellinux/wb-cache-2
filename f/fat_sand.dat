50|$|This species usually {{lives in}} sandy deserts, {{but may also}} be found in rocky terrain or saline marsh areas. It lives in burrows, which are often located under the bushes in which the rats forage, such as salt bushes of the family Chenopodiaceae. The <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat is diurnal, but its {{activity}} on the surface depends on the ambient temperature. The <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat normally has two litters every year; each litter usually comprises three to seven pups.|$|E

40|$|Treatment {{of sewage}} results in {{creation}} of by-products such as screenings, <b>fats,</b> <b>sand</b> {{and the primary}} and secondary sludges – the most disposed elements in the technological process. Disposal of hazardous wastes {{is one of the}} most important issues in waste management. 	Regulation of the Minister of Economy dated 1 January 2016 (Dz. U. 2015 item 1277 – Journal of Laws) which disallows the storage of sewage sludges, influenced the search for new solutions of their utilization. Forecasted increase in the amount of produced sludges and regulations in effect resulted in the increased interest in methods of utilization and studies on waste management. 	The study shows environmental possibilities of utilization of municipal sewage. The physicochemical and environmental properties of studied materials were determined. The studies were performed on sewer sludge obtained from mechanical biological municipal treatment plant “Pomorzany” in Szczecin. By-products of incineration biomass were used to prepare the sludge-ash mixes. 	Physicochemical properties were determined using reference methods according to current Standards and Instructions. To determine the environmental properties of sludge and mixes phytotoxicity test was used. The influence of soil’s toxicity on the plants was determined based on a method provided by the Regulation of the Minister of Environment dated 13 May 2004 on conditions in which it is assumed that waste is not hazardous (Dz. U. 2004 no. 128, item 1347 – Journal of Laws), “Determination of cytotoxic activity in garden cress”. 	Performed physicochemical tests and phytotoxicity test proved the applicability of prepared mixes in agriculture, remediation of anthropogenic soils and shutting down and revegetation of old landfills...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{suitability}} of industrial by-product oil-clay to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion was studied. Oil-clay (spent bleaching earth) contains high amounts of <b>fats</b> and clay (<b>sand).</b> The methane production potential was studied by methane production batch assay with two mesophilic and one thermophilic inoculum. Methane production potential of oil-clay was high in all assays ranging from 532 to 664 l CH 4 /kg substrate VS added and from 728 to 922 l CH 4 /kg substrate VS removed. The yield {{was close to}} the theoretical maximum of fats. No inhibition caused by high lipid content of the substrate was ob-served, only some differences in the lag phase before the methane production initiated. Pretreatment with alkali increased the soluble COD but it did not {{have an effect on the}} methane production potential of oil-clay in batch assay. Thermal pretreatment had no effect on soluble COD levels. The behavior of oil-clay in the anaerobic digestion vessel was observed to be problematic, because of its tendency to float and after wetting sink quickly to the bottom. The spent oil-clay is acidic (pH 3. 5) causing the need to adjust the pH before feeding it to the digester. As a conclusion it can be postulated that oil-clay substrate used is a potent feedstock for methane production by anaerobic digestion. Its methane production potential is high and the volatile solids of the substrate are efficiently used for methanogenesis. However the acidic nature, high lipid content and behavior in the vessel need to be taken into account when planning full scale application. More studies with actual reactors and careful planning of the input amounts and processes are needed to evaluate this issue further...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The gallbladders of 256 <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rats (131 {{males and}} 125 females) seven to 41 months old were studied histologically. None {{of the sand}} rats {{had been used in}} {{experimental}} procedures prior to death. Diffuse polypoid hyperplasia or papilloma of the gallbladder mucosa was found in 49 sand rats. Of these lesions, 45 were present in 126 sand rats {{in the second half of}} their lifespan. Neither concretions nor signs of chronic inflammation were seen. Signs of focal epithelial growth activity were seen in either form of lesion. Epithelial hyperplasia was excessive in two gallbladders, and one was diagnosed as carcinoma-in-situ. The papilloma in one sand rat revealed transition to adenocarcinoma, with penetration into the deep layers of the gallbladder. Preneoplastic nodules were found in the liver as frequently as reported previously, but they were unrelated to gallbladder lesions. The unusual high incidence of spontaneous epithelial proliferation in the gallbladder mucosa in sand rats of both sexes through several generations suggests this strain as a model in the experimental study of tumorigenesis in the gallbladder. In the colony of <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rats developed and maintained at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, we previously observed a high incidence of spontaneous hepatoma and preneoplastic changes [22]. This article reports a series of spontaneous epithelial proliferative lesions, including papillomas, in the gallbladder of our stock of untreated sand rats. We will show that the lesions occurred with higher frequency than described in published attempts at inducing gallbladder tumors by chemical carcinogens, with or without simultaneous mechanical irritation...|$|E
40|$|A nation-wide {{survey of}} ticks infesting wild animals {{has been carried}} out for two {{consecutive}} years. Among the mammals, mainly rodents were investigated, but also some carnivores and insectivores (hedgehogs). Ticks were also collected from reptiles. The <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat Psammomys obesus was by far the most heavily infested mammal, but Hyalomma impeltatum was the only tick species recorded on this host. On other rodent species, smaller numbers of the early stages of various Hyalomma species were found. Less commonly, rodents also carried nymphs of species of the Rhipicephalus sanguineus group, whose adults were found on carnivores and on Pamechinus aethiopicus.

40|$|Abstract Background Exposure to {{continuous}} and impulse noise can induce a hearing loss. Leupeptin is an inhibitor of the calpains, {{a family of}} calcium-activated proteases which promote cell death. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess whether Leupeptin could reduce the hearing loss resulting from rifle impulse noise. Methods A polyethelene tube was implanted into middle ear cavities of eight <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rats (16 ears). Following determination of auditory nerve brainstem evoked response (ABR) threshold in each ear, the animals were exposed to the noise of 10 M 16 rifle shots. Immediately after the exposure, saline was then applied to one (control) ear and non-toxic concentrations of leupeptin determined in the first phase of the study were applied to the other ear, for four consecutive days. Results Eight days after the exposure, the threshold shift (ABR) in the control ears was significantly greater (44 dB) than in the leupeptin ears (27 dB). Conclusion Leupeptin applied to the middle ear cavity can reduce the hearing loss resulting from exposure to impulse noise. </p...|$|E
40|$|A 20 -d growth assay was {{conducted}} to determine the appropriate true ileal digestible lysine requirement to maximize growth performance of pigs between 27 to 44 lb. The basal diet (1. 0 % true ileal digestible lysine; 20. 1 % CP) was corn-soybean meal-based and was formulated to contain 3 % added <b>fat.</b> <b>Sand</b> was substituted with L-lysine⋅HCl to form the other treatment diets (1. 1, 1. 2, 1. 3, and 1. 4 % true ileal digestible lysine). The positive control contained more soybean meal than the basal diet (44. 2 vs. 32. 2 % of the diet) and no L-lysine⋅HCl to provide 1. 3 % true ileal digestible lysine. Growth performance improved (quadratic, P< 0. 04) with increasing true ileal digestible lysine and was maximized at 1. 1 % true ileal digestible lysine. Feed efficiency was better (quadratic, P< 0. 01) for pigs fed increasing true ileal digestible lysine and was best for pigs fed 1. 3 % true ileal digestible lysine. These {{results indicate that the}} true ileal digestible lysine requirement for the 27 to 44 lb pig is at least 1. 1 % for ADG and 1. 3 % for feed efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Auditory {{sensation}} can be elicited by {{air conduction}} (AC) and by bone conduction (BC). It {{is also possible}} to elicit such responses by applying the standard clinical bone vibrator to the skin over soft tissue sites on the head, neck, or thorax of humans and animals. This mode of auditory stimulation has been called soft tissue conduction (STC). This {{study was designed to}} investigate the pathway between soft tissue sites and the ear. Methods: The air in the middle ear was replaced with saline solution in an animal with unique anatomy — the <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat, in which about 70 % of a thin-walled inner ear bulges into the middle ear bulla cavity — while we recorded the audi-tory brain stem responses (ABRs) to AC, BC, and STC stimulation. Results: This replacement of air with saline solution led to a significant improvement in STC threshold. With AC stimu-lation, the ABR threshold was elevated and the latency of the first ABR wave was prolonged. Consistent changes were not seen with BC stimulation. Conclusions: When the air (which has a very low acoustic impedance) that normally surrounds most of the inner ear is replaced with saline solution (which has an acoustic impedance similar to that of soft tissues), the STC threshold is improved. This improvement may be due to improved transmission of acoustic energy from the soft tissues to the inner ear...|$|E
40|$|Aim of the work: The {{present study}} aimed to compare between the anatomy, {{histology}} and histochemistry of two species belonging to two different families namely Muridae and Dipodidae. Muridae {{is the largest}} family of rodents in the world; it is represented in this work by <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat Psammomys obesus. Four-toed jerboa Allactaga tetradactyla represents the other family, Dipodidae. Psammomys obesus lives in coastal presaharan region; the preferred habitat is saline marshes and wadis where halophytic plants were abundant. However, Allactaga tetradactyla, inhabites the salt marshes and clay desert areas of coastal plains. Material and methods: The investigated animals were collected from desert, weighed and transferred alive to the laboratory in separate cages then anaesthetized with ether, after which they were carefully dissected, organs are taken out and prepared for the histological and histochemical studies. The nucleocytoplasmic index of liver cells was calculated, kidney weighed and the relative thickness of cortex, outer and inner medulla was measured and total glomerular number was recorded. Results: The liver, as in mammalian species, is consists of five separate lobes. The mitotic index of Psammomys obesus is smaller than that found in Allactaga tetradactyla. This {{may be due to}} the increased activity of Allactaga tetradactyla. In the kidney, the cortex is classified into three regions namely superficial, midcortical and juxtamedullary zones. Both number and diameter of glomeruli, glomerular volume and relative glomerular blood volume is greater in Psammomys obesus than that in Allactaga tetradactyla. Conclusion: These observations indicate the ability of Psammomys obesus to produce highly concentrated urine than that of Allactaga tetradactyl...|$|E
40|$|The {{tapeworm}} Raillietina trapezoides was {{studied in}} a Tunisian {{population of the}} <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat Psammomys obesus. Seasonal changes in the abundance of parasite and host were monitored in a longitudinal field survey lasting 20 months. In total 582 intestinal samples were collected during 10 trapping sessions between May 1995 and January 1997 and examined. The impact of abiotic and biotic factors on the prevalence and parasite burden were explored, using generalized linear models. R. trapezoides showed a seasonal pattern with most transmission occurring in summer and autumn. In August-September when the rodents were at low density and most adult (90 - 100 %) were infected. In winter, infections with R. trapezoides were highly prevalent in the cohort of adults only. The worm burden by number was also high in late summer and autumn. Prevalence and parasite burden by number or by biomass were highly age dependent. Season and age act in synergy so that the rodents were highly infected in late summer and autumn. Unusually dry conditions in winter seemed to increase prevalence and {{to reduce the number}} of worms. There was no difference between males and females in prevalence or parasite burden (by number or by biomass). Prevalence was not correlated with the relative density of the hosts whereas parasite burden depended upon their densities. The more numerous the worms were, the smaller they were individually, reflecting a crowding effect. The possibility of an immune response regulating P. obesus is discussed, in regard to the very high natural prevalence and the variation in worm burden, and compared with other parasite-host systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{increasing}} number of studies revealed the importance of estrogen in male reproduction. However, most research was conducted in laboratory rodents subjected to standardized environmental conditions. Therefore, seasonal regulations of estrogen pathways remain poorly understood under natural conditions. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of several molecules involved in the functioning of testis (i. e. 17 -β estradiol [E 2], P 450 aromatase, estrogen receptors ESR 1, ESR 2, and GPER 1 [also known as GPR 30]) were investigated in free-ranging <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rats, Psammomys obesus, during the breeding and resting seasons. Leydig cells showed a strong immunoreactivity for aromatase in the testis sampled during the breeding season only; however, E 2, ESR 1, ESR 2 and GPER 1 were present during both seasons. Sertoli cells showed a positive signal for E 2 and ESR 2 during the breeding season; though, all molecules, except GPER 1, were present during the resting season. Spermatogonia were reactive for E 2, ESR 2 and GPER 1 during the breeding season and for ESR 1 and GPER 1 during the resting season. During both seasons, spermatocytes-I presented a moderate reactivity for E 2, ESR 1, ESR 2 and a strong reactivity for GPER 1; aromatase was detected during the resting season only. Spermatids and spermatozoa were present exclusively during breeding season and were reactive for all molecules; except round spermatids that were negative for aromatase. The functioning of the testis depends on finely tuned stimulation and inhibition systems. Our results suggest that differential expression of aromatase, ESR 1, ESR 2, and GPER 1 across cells types {{is involved in the}} seasonal activation/inactivation cycle of spermatogenesis in a free-ranging species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEstrogen plays {{a crucial}} role in {{regulating}} epididymal function and development. Estrogen signalingis mediated via two main receptors essentially involved in the genomic regulatingpathway: ERα and ERβ. Recent studies revealed the contribution of a novel estrogen receptorinvolved in the non-genomic pathway: GPER 1. This receptor belongs to the family of seventransmembraneG-protein-coupled receptors and it triggers rapid cellular responses. Immunohistochemicalstudies and Western Blot analyses were performed to investigate the GPER 1 expressionin the caput and cauda epididymis of free-ranging <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rats (Psammomys obesus) captured during the breeding and resting seasons. We also investigated the effect of castration(C), castration followed by testosterone treatment (C+ T), and ligation of the efferent ducts (L). During the breeding season, a marked positive GPER 1 immunoreactivity was detected in thecytoplasm of principal cells and basal cells; this signal persisted during the resting season, attenuatedhowever, meanwhile the clear cells were not immuno-reactive. In C animals, the immuno-histochemical staining underwent nuclear translocation. In C +T animals, this responsebecame nuclear and cytoplasmic. In the L group, the expression of the GPER 1 was mainly locatedin the cytoplasm of principal cells and in the nuclei of basal cells; the sperm was also immunepositivein the cauda epididymis. Western blot analysis showed that GPER 1 has a molecularweight of 55 kDa in the caput and cauda epididymis during the breeding season, and it persistedduring the resting season in the caput epididymis with a decrease in the cauda epididymis. Theseresults suggest that GPER 1 mediate a specific cellular estrogen signaling with marked differencesbetween the breeding and resting seasons. Experimental groups suggest that testosterone is involvedin the regulation of the expression of GPER 1, in addition to other estrogen signalizationpathways...|$|E
40|$|The causative {{agent of}} {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis, Leishmania major, was studied in a Tunisian {{population of the}} <b>fat</b> <b>sand</b> rat, Psammomys obesus. Seasonal changes in the abundances of parasite and host were monitored in a longitudinal field survey lasting 21 months. Overall, 566 P. obesus, collected during 10 trapping sessions between May 199 5 and January 1997, were examined. Analysis of prevalence, using logistic regression, revealed that extrinsic factors, such as season and climatic conditions, and intrinsic factors, such as host age, have a combined effect. Leishmania major showed a seasonal pattern, with most transmission occurring in late summer and in autumn, when prevalences were 7. 5 - and 6. 6 -fold higher, respectively, than in spring. Prevalence peaked, at 70 %, in September 1995 and then decreased to 0 % in June 1996. The same temporal fluctuation was observed during the second study year, albeit among prevalences that were relatively low because of unusually dry conditions. Prevalence was highly dependent on {{the age of the}} P. obesus, and season and age acted in synergy so that the rodents were highly infected in late summer and in autumn. Prevalence was not correlated with the relative density of the P. obesus and also appeared independent of gender. Although the ear lesions observed on 378 sand rats during a 1 -year survey were closely associated with Leishmania infection, such lesions were not good predictors of infection, as 35 % of the rodents found to be infected had no visible lesions on their ears. The prevalences of Leishmania infection observed in this study, among P. obesus living in monospecific colonies, were generally lower than those observed in other studies of P. obesus. It seems possible that P. obesus living in monospecific colonies could have a lesser role in propagating the parasite than those living in plurispecific colonies of rodents, and act as an 'epidemiological sink'...|$|E
