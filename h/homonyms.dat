5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839. Its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex, riddled with confusion with Trachylepis maculata and other species, <b>homonyms,</b> and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and {{is thought to have}} reached its island from Africa by rafting. The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may well be the same species.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{states that}} names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1–3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier <b>homonyms</b> and {{competing}} synonyms. This {{means that the}} name Hypochnus rubrocinctum has priority over Byssus sanguinea. The type material of H.rubrocinctum was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The drawing in Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype. The species {{was transferred to the}} genus Cryptothecia by Swedish lichenologist Göran Thor in 1991, {{on the basis of its}} similarity with C.striata such as the thallus with radiate ridges, granular isidia, and presence of para-depsides (gyrophoric acid in C.striata and confluentic acid in C.rubrocincta).|$|E
5|$|Elemental Spirits, {{also called}} Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are <b>homonyms</b> of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E

25|$|A common {{argument}} for retaining Chinese characters is that romanization systems are insufficient to unambiguously represent the Chinese language, {{due to the}} large number of <b>homonyms.</b> (However, the Chinese military has found pinyin to be sufficient to telegraph military communications, even without indicating tone.) Because General Chinese makes many distinctions that Pinyin does not, it has many fewer <b>homonyms</b> to confuse the reader. Combine this with the fact that many traditional Chinese characters are restricted to specific compounds, and that many homonymic characters distinguish meanings of what are historically the same word, and which are therefore understandable in context, Chao believed that General Chinese begins to approach the effectiveness of traditional characters in representing Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Bulgarian: stress, {{which is}} {{variable}} in Bulgarian, {{is not usually}} indicated in Bulgarian except in dictionaries and sometimes in <b>homonyms</b> that are distinguished only by stress.

25|$|Since the Late Joseon dynasty period, various Hanja-Hangul mixed {{systems were}} used. In these systems, Hanja {{were used for}} lexical roots, and Hangul for {{grammatical}} words and inflections, much as kanji and kana are used in Japanese. Today however, Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are now mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating <b>homonyms.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, the {{realization}} of entering tones in Beijing dialect, and thus in Standard Chinese, is not predictable when a syllable has a voiceless initial such as bat or pat. In such cases even syllables with the same GC spelling may have different tones in Beijing, though they remain <b>homonyms</b> in other Mandarin dialects, such as Xian and Sichuanese. This is due to historical dialect-mixing in the Chinese capital that resulted in unavoidably idiosyncratic correspondences.|$|E

25|$|This {{family was}} first {{separated}} {{under the name}} Lariidae Newman, 1832, Sphinx vespiformis, an essay : 40, 44 (as Lariae), based on the nominal genus Laria Schrank, 1802, a junior <b>homonym</b> of Laria Scopoli, 1763. The next name established for this family was Liparidae Boisduval, 1834, Icon. hist. Lepid. nouv. ou peu connus 2 : 134 (as Liparides), based on the nominal genus Liparis Ochsenheimer, 1810, a junior <b>homonym</b> of Liparis Scopoli, 1777.

25|$|In Spanish, the {{grapheme}} ñ {{is considered}} a new letter different from n and collated between n and o, as it denotes a different sound {{from that of a}} plain n. But the accented vowels á, é, í, ó, ú are not separated from the unaccented vowels a, e, i, o, u, as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between <b>homonyms,</b> and does not modify the sound of a letter.|$|E
25|$|Filipino has the {{following}} composite characters: á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino, however, is rare, and is meant only {{to distinguish between}} <b>homonyms</b> with different stresses and meanings that either occur near {{each other in a}} text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise ambiguous meaning. Sometimes appears in Spanish loanwords and names if Spanish orthography is observed.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{version of}} General Chinese uses distinct characters for any traditional characters that are distinguished phonemically {{in any of}} the control varieties of Chinese, which consist of several dialects of Mandarin, Wu, Min, Hakka, and Yue. That is, a single syllabic character will only correspond to more than one logographic character when these are <b>homonyms</b> in all control dialects. In effect, General Chinese is a syllabic reconstruction of the pronunciation of Middle Chinese, less distinctions which have been dropped nearly everywhere.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the cult and iconography on frescoes of two St. Andrews developed within the Byzantine world, one being an archbishop of Crete and the other, his <b>homonym,</b> a saint {{from the same}} island, known as Saint Andrew “in Crisi”. Those researches proved that both <b>homonym</b> saints were venerated not only through the entire medieval period but moreover, their cults developed equally, however St. Andrew, the archbishop of Crete, was more prominent figure than his <b>homonym.</b> Nevertheless, the same epithet and name brings to confusion in their later identification. After a thorough examination of iconography of two saints in certain representations of Crete’s archbishop, the other saint is identified, a <b>homonym</b> of the famous byzantine writer.

25|$|There is a {{clear trend}} toward the {{exclusive}} use of hangul in day-to-day South Korean society. Hanja are still used to some extent, particularly in newspapers, weddings, place names and calligraphy (although it is nowhere near the extent of kanji use in day-to-day Japanese society). Hanja is also extensively used in situations where ambiguity must be avoided, such as academic papers, high-level corporate reports, government documents, and newspapers; {{this is due to}} the large number of <b>homonyms</b> that have resulted from extensive borrowing of Chinese words.|$|E
25|$|Both Koreas {{have used}} Hangul or mixed Hangul as their sole {{official}} writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began {{to experience a}} gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of <b>homonyms.</b> There has been widespread debate as {{to the future of}} Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated Hangul as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.|$|E
25|$|The {{realization}} of the tones in the various varieties of Chinese is generally predictable; see Four tones for details. In Beijing Mandarin, for example, even tone is split according to voicing, with muddy consonants becoming aspirates: ba, pa, ma, bha → bā, pā, má, pá (and mha → mā). Going tone is not split, and muddy consonants become tenuis: bah, pah, mah, bhah → bà, pà, mà, bà. Rising tone splits, not along voicing, but with muddy-consonant syllables conflating with going tone: baa, paa, maa, bhaa → bǎ, pǎ, mǎ, bà. That is, bhaa and bhah are <b>homonyms</b> in Beijing, as indeed they are in all of Mandarin, in Wu apart from Wenzhounese, in Hakka, and in reading pronunciations of Cantonese. Entering tone is likewise split in Beijing: mat, bhat → mà, bá.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{also have}} {{many ways of}} {{indicating}} class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving {{the bridge of the}} song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often <b>homonyms</b> were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.|$|E
25|$|Legends of Syrah's origins {{come from}} one of its <b>homonyms,</b> Shiraz. Because Shiraz, Capital of the Persian Empire (modern-day Iran), {{produced}} the well-known Shirazi wine, legends claim the Syrah grape originated in Shiraz and then was brought to Rhône. At least two significantly {{different versions of the}} myth are reported, giving different accounts of how the variety is supposed to have been brought from Shiraz to Rhône, and differing up to 1,800 years in dating this event. In one version, the Phocaeans could have brought Syrah/Shiraz to their colony around Marseilles (then known as Massilia), which was founded around 600 BC by the Greeks. The grape would then later have made its way to northern Rhône, which was never colonized by the Phocaeans. No documentary evidence exists to back up this legend, and it also requires the variety to later vanish from the Marseilles region without leaving any trace.|$|E
