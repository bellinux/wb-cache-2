5000|$|A popular {{general purpose}} {{linerless}} sealing mechanism {{which can be}} used on most all bottles. The design typically features a [...]045” molded <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> which when applied with normal application torque compresses to approximately one-half of its thickness while sealing against the bottle lip. The liner creates a water tight seal with a bottle having a minimum [...]065” wide sealing surface which is free of nicks, burrs or irregularities. This style linerless mechanism is available in popular dispensing caps.|$|E
50|$|The girt is {{commonly}} used as a stabilizing element to the primary structure (e.g. column, post). Wall cladding fastened to the girt, or a discrete bracing system which includes the girt, can provide shear resistance, in {{the plane of the}} wall, {{along the length of the}} primary member. Since the girts are normally fastened to, or near, the exterior flange of a column, stability braces may be installed at a girt to resist rotation of the unsupported, <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> of the primary member. The girt system must be competent and adequately stiff to provide the required stabilizing resistance in addition to its role as a wall panel support.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and angle of unbalance. Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>flanges</b> of the wheel. Dynamic balance is better (it is more comprehensive) than static balance alone, because both couple and static forces are measured and corrected.|$|R

Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes {{to tighten the}} rear, <b>inner</b> hub <b>flange</b> bolts. Using wording from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car. The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line, where the Roadster glider was built. Lotus also recalled some Elise and Exige vehicles for the same reason.|$|R
50|$|When {{examined}} by the driver and fireman, one of the cast iron girders of the bridge {{was found to have}} fractured, unusually, near to one of the abutments rather than at the centre of the beam. The track was supported by a pair of identical girders with Barlow rails cut to length laid across the <b>inner</b> <b>flange,</b> with asphalted ballast on top, just below the sleepers. When Captain Henry Whatley Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate examined the fracture surface, he found it rusted over, but the evidence of those who had seen it first, showed just what had happened. The cast iron girder had broken vertically from an enormous defect in the web and flanges, where there was a complete gap between the sides. The girder was completely defective here, but why no one had spotted it before the accident remains a mystery. Tyler suggests that it may have grown from an internal void with time, simply because such a defect would surely have been discovered either by the foundry or the builders. The girder had been installed 23 years before, in 1837, and should have supported a central load of 90 tons if in good condition. The pair of girders should have supported a total load of 360 tons distributed over all the structure, and Tyler stated that the girder was much bigger than was needed for the job. The engine weighed 31 tons and the tender 18 tons.|$|E
50|$|A {{conspicuous}} basal trait is the {{shortness of}} the head; in later forms {{it would be}} longer relative to the trunk. Also the snout is relatively short, only about {{twice as long as}} the part behind the eye-socket. The nasals do not reach further backwards than the eye-sockets. The suture between the nasal bone and the frontal is transversely oriented. From the prefrontal a flange overhangs the upper front edge of the eye-socket, perhaps to protect the eyes. The frontal is part of the top edge of the eye-socket and thus lacks a lateral buttress. The frontal is about as large as the parietal. In top view the rear edge of the skull roof is notched. The parietal eye (or at least the foramen parietale) is located between the parietals, not (partly) between the frontals as with later forms. The squamosal is a large element, as large as the quadratojugal with which it is firmly fused. The basisphenoid is narrow. The cultriform process of the parasphenoid at the rear gradually merges with the main body, not via a narrow waist as with later forms. The palate was not firmly attached to the basipterygoid, allowing the snout some vertical movement relative to the remainder of the skull. In most ichthyosaurs no such movement was possible. The opening between the pterygoids was narrow and slit-like, not wide. The pterygoids do not cover the rear underside of the braincase. The neck is relatively long. The tail is elongated, about as long as the head, neck and trunk combined. The vertebrae of the tail base are elongated also, about {{as long as they are}} tall. The longest tail spines are located rather to the front indicating that a possible tail fin must have been more horizontal than with later forms. The clavicles have a wide <b>inner</b> <b>flange.</b> The scapula is short, wider than long. The humerus still has a distinct head but not yet a dorsal trochanter. At its lower end, the humerus has a larger facet contacting the radius than contacting the ulna. The upper end of the ulna is narrower than the lower end, not equal in size to it. In general the bones of the lower arm, including the hand bones, are rather elongated, not transformed into discs. The ulna and radius still have a shaft as with land animals. In the wrist the pisiform is about as large as the ulnar carpal, not much smaller or absent. The fifth metacarpal has a convex rear edge and is longer than the fourth distal carpal. There are still five fingers present, without a reduction of the first finger. Polydactyly, an extra number of fingers, is thus lacking. Hyperphalangy, supernumerary phalanges, is likewise absent. The phalanx formula is 2-3-4-4-2. The upper phalanges are relatively elongated, longer than wide. The lower phalanges still show ossification below the cartilage perichondrium and have notches in their edges. The pubic bone is perforated by a foramen obturatum, which closed in side view and located some distance from the rear edge of the body. The hindfin is about as large as the forefin, not smaller. In the thighbone, the facet contacting the tibia is as large and as far reaching downwards as the facet contacting the fibula. Between the tibia and fibula still a space is present, and both bones, though flattened are relatively elongated with a clear shaft. The same is true for the metatarsals, that are cylinder-shaped. There are still five toes present, again rather elongated and hourglass-shaped. An early derived trait is the relative shortness of the spines of the tail. The humerus has a flange at the front edge but it is not secondarily reduced. The flange has a small notch. The fifth metatarsal is shortened and the first is even shorter. The fifth toe is shorter than the first toe.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInner flange {{and side}} {{wrinkling}} often occur in rotary-draw bending process of rectangular aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes, {{and the distribution}} and magnitude of wrinkling is related to geometrical parameters of the tubes. In order to {{study the effects of}} geometrical parameters on wrinkling of rectangular wave-guide tubes, a 3 D-FE model for rotary-draw bending processes of thin-walled rectangular aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes was built based on the platform of ABAQUS/Explicit, and its reliability was validated by experiments. Simulation and analysis of the influence laws of geometrical parameters on the wave heights of <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> and side wrinkling were then carried out. The results show that <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> wrinkling is the main wrinkling way to rectangular wave-guide tubes in rotary-draw bending processes, but side wrinkling cannot be neglected because side wrinkling is 2 / 3 of <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> wrinkling when b and h are smaller. <b>Inner</b> <b>flange</b> and side wrinkling increase with increasing b and h; the influence of b on side wrinkling is larger than that of h, while both b and h affect <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> wrinkling greatly. <b>Inner</b> <b>flange</b> and side wrinkling decrease with increasing R/h; the influence of h on <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> and side wrinkling is larger than that of R...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new welding-based {{solution}} that significantly increases the rotation {{capacity of a}} stiffened welded knee joint between cold-formed rectangular hollow sections under opening moment. The proposed solution is more economical than the use of internal sleeves and {{can be applied to}} new as well as existing structures. The solution involves the use of extra layers of weld on the <b>inner</b> (tension) <b>flange</b> of a stiffened welded knee joint. Laboratory test results are presented to demonstrate that the solution enabled such a joint between DuraGal C 450 150 × 50 × 4 or 150 × 50 × 5 rectangular hollow sections manufactured to AS 1163 to satisfy the rotation capacity requirement specified for plastic design of steel frames. The reason why the new solution results in increased rotation capacities is explained in terms of strain redistribution and strain reduction in the tensile regions around the knee joints...|$|R
40|$|The fire {{performance}} of cold-formed steel members {{is an important}} criterion to be verified for their successful use in structural applications. However, lack of clear design guidance on their {{fire performance}} has inhibited their usage in buildings. Their elevated temperature mechanical properties, i. e., yield strengths, elastic moduli and stress–strain relationships, are imperative for the fire design. In the past many researchers have proposed elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors for cold-formed steels, however, large variations exist among them. The LiteSteel Beam (LSB), a hollow flange channel section, is manufactured by a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. Its web, <b>inner</b> and outer <b>flange</b> elements have different yield strengths due to varying levels of cold-working caused by their manufacturing process. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSBs {{are not the same}} even within their cross-sections. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken to determine the elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel plate elements in LSBs. Elevated temperature tensile tests were performed on web, <b>inner</b> and outer <b>flange</b> specimens taken from LSBs, and their results are presented in this paper including their comparisons with previous studies. Based on the test results and the proposed values from previous studies and fire design standards, suitable predictive equations are proposed for the determination of elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSB web and flange elements. Suitable stress–strain models are also proposed for the plate elements of this cold-formed and welded hollow flange channel section...|$|R

40|$|Key Words: Tailor rolling blanks; Square box deep drawing; Formability Abstract. As a new {{lightweight}} structural sheet metal, tailor rolled blanks {{has a good}} prospect in {{the future}} development of the automobile industry, and its formability is the current research focus.

40|$|CDATA[This {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to describe and evaluate a modified two-stage technique of rumen cannulation in sheep. Ten healthy, castrated, Makoyee sheep with no previous history of gastrointestinal dysfunction were chosen. The surgical technique was performed in two stages. In the first, a 5 -cm vertical incision {{was made in the}} mid paralumbar fossa. The incision was continued through the subcutaneous. Then the muscular layers of the abdominal wall were divided in the grid technique. The dorso- lateral portion of the dorsal sac of rumen was anchored to the skin by application of four interrupted horizontal mattress suture at 4 points circumferentially using No. 1 silk. In the second, the exposed rumenal wall was incised longitudinally at the mid part of the stay sutures. A rubber-sheep cannula was inserted into the opening and then fixed with an external elastic washer. To augment the cannula stability, the <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> was also reinforced with a tough rubber washer. All the sheep had normal behavior and appetite during the experiment. In the follow up period no local inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tissue flap necrosis, wound dehiscence; and suture abscess encountered in the surgical site. Neither evidences of anorexia, toxemia, septicemia and peritonitis were detected. No sign of intra peritoneal infection was observed on inspection of carcasses. The sheep did not lose weight significantly and the cannulas remained permanent fixed in position in 9 cases. This modified ruminal cannulation technique could be considered as a useful alternative with less failure and no more adverse consequences. Furthermore, the technique might be recommended to veterinary scientists who deal with experimental studies on sheep nutrition and husbandry. ]]...|$|E
40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{the process of}} forging an outer flange on a tube double-sided radial extrusion has been studied to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the mechanics governing material flow inside the die-cavity. Finite element models, capable of replicating all previously identified modes of deformation and related defects, were generated. A process analysis, based on these conditioned models, led to the proposal of an alternative operational sequence which includes the performing of a geometrically simple <b>inner</b> <b>flange</b> on the tube; the intention being to extended the existing formability limits set by folding due to instability of the tube wall. Preliminary experimental tests proved the concept to be feasible, and detailed studies, among others using animation as a post-processor, allowed a description of the changed flow mechanisms introduced by the new process configuration. Further numerical investigations were carried out to establish actual preform design rules for the radial extrusion of tubular components for a whole range of parameter combinations. The analysis was made in conjunction with experimental tests, performed to support the theoretical findings. As a mean to substantiate the feasibility of the radial extrusion concept and illustrate its production potential, an engineering component, that can be manufactured advantageously by radial extrusion, was produced in aluminium. The theoretical and experimental work on the extrusion of tubes furthermore led to an investigation on the numerical modelling of the friction conditions in bulk metal processes, and formed the technological basis for the development of an automatic remeshing and refinement scheme for quadrilateral finite elements meshes. The former resulted in the proposal of a complementary ring test geometry for calibration of friction models under low nominal normal pressure, and the latter in the development of a local mesh densification strategy based on past, present and expected future plastic deformationAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
