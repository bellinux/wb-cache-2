Methods  This interventional, analytical study, had a one group pretest-posttest design, and was done on children in four elementary schools in the Talawaan District, North Minahasa Regency from August to November 2014. Inclusion criteria were elementary students aged 6 - 9 years with lead poisoning (lead levels ≥ 10 μg/dL) and good nutritional status. Subjects were  given NaFeEDTA 115. 4 mg (15 mg elemental iron) at a dosage of 3 mg/kgBW/day elemental iron given between meal times.

40|$|Background Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA) {{is frequently}} found in school-aged children. The main treatments for IDA are overcoming the causal factors and iron supplementation. Noncompliance in taking iron tablets {{and the possibility}} of iron absorbtion or transport difficulties, can reduce efficacy of daily oral iron supplementation.

The experimental mate-rial comprised the lumbar and thoracic parts of the longissimus dorsi (musculus longissimus lumborum et musculus longissimus thoracis) muscle of pigs. The aim of the performed experiments was to analyse the impact of different composition of brines which contained a specific quantity of salts of inorganic acids on the value of active acidity, water activity, water holding capacity and the way of water binding. It was found that both parts of raw longissimus dorsi muscle differed with regard to the pH value, water activity and molecular dynamics of bound water. The water holding capacity as well as the mutual relationships between the quantities of free and bound waters were identical. The type of the applied brine exerted some influence on the level of water holding capacity. The relative amount of free water in relation to bound water analysed on the basis of relaxation measurements was the highest when the mixture of sodium chloride and sodium triphosphate was applied. The mixture of chloride and <b>sodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> reduced the relative content of free water in relation to bound water in comparison with the application of brine which contained only NaCl and increased it in comparison with the application of diphosphate.
