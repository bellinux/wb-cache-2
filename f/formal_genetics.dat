40|$|Abstract: The {{two major}} afflictions {{of the oral}} cavity are dental caries and gingival/periodontal disease. While {{microorganisms}} have long been acknowledged as important etiologic factors, the most recent research data demonstrate that both of these pathologic conditions have a strong hereditary base, i. e., even {{in the presence of}} putative pathogenic microorganisms, if the host individual is not genetically susceptible, ensuing disease will be mild or even nonexistent. In the face of this evidence for heritability of the two major oral diseases, we evaluated what educational experiences in genetics were provided to students in U. S. dental schools and dental hygiene programs in 2003 - 04. Our survey of fifty-four dental schools revealed that only one requires a <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> course before admission, and only six incorporate a required genetics course within the dental curriculum. Of the 264 dental hygiene programs surveyed, none require a <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> course as a prerequisite for admission, and none require a <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> course within their curricula. The enormous successes, and future promise, of the Human Genome Project suggest that genetics will soon dominate the future of medicine and dentistry, in prediction of diseases, disease diagnosis, and, eventually, therapy for genetically based disorders. It is therefore incumbent upon dental and dental hygiene education programs to provide genetics education for tomorrow’s practitioners.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an examination of}} genetic-based technological change in the Canadian beef cattle industry. A model of technological change is explicitly developed in characteristics space. Production functions with genetic characteristics as arguments are estimated and two forms of technological change identified. Shadow values for characteristics are then calculated and actual genetic improvements are compared to the improvements suggested by the shadow prices. It is concluded that market forces are sufficient to regulate the process of genetic-based technological change in the Canadian beef cattle industry. In agriculture {{a major component of}} technological change is genetic improve-ment. Economic analysis of technological change has traditionally been carried out in goods space. Economists have treated new varieties of rice or wheat as new goods which act as arguments in aggregate pro-duction functions. Genetic research, how-ever, is carried out in terms of character-istics which are quantifiable and heritable. The process of selecting the characteristics to improve has been left to geneticists. In the North American beef cattle in-dustry, however, the responsibility for ge-netic improvement lies primarily with the individual stock breeder. As the potential for genetic improvement in beef cattle is large, some assurance that the market pro-vides the incentives to initiate improve-ments and that stockmen (most of whom have no <b>formal</b> training in <b>genetics)</b> rec-ognize the incentives is desirable.

40|$|Background: As {{advances}} in genetics {{are becoming increasingly}} relevant to mainstream healthcare, a major challenge {{is to ensure that}} these are integrated appropriately into mainstream medical services. In 2003, the Department of Health for England announced the availability of start-up funding for ten 'Mainstreaming Genetics' pilot services to develop models to achieve this. Methods: Multiple methods were used to explore the pilots' experiences of incorporating genetics which might inform the development of new services in the future. A workshop with project staff, an email questionnaire, interviews and a thematic analysis of pilot final reports were carried out. Results: Seven themes relating to the integration of genetics into mainstream medical services were identified: planning services to incorporate genetics; the involvement of genetics departments; the establishment of roles incorporating genetic activities; identifying and involving stakeholders; the challenges of working across specialty boundaries; working with multiple healthcare organisations; and the importance of cultural awareness of genetic conditions. Pilots found that the planning phase often included the need to raise awareness of genetic conditions and services and that early consideration of organisational issues such as clinic location was essential. The <b>formal</b> involvement of <b>genetics</b> departments was crucial to success; benefits included provision of clinical and educational support for staff in new roles. Recruitment and retention for new roles outside usual career pathways sometimes proved difficult. Differences in specialties' working practices and working with multiple healthcare organisations also brought challenges such as the 'genetic approach' of working with families, incompatible record systems and different approaches to health professionals' autonomous practice. 'Practice points' have been collated into a Toolkit which includes resources from the pilots, including job descriptions and clinical tools. These can be customised for reuse by other services. Conclusions: Healthcare services need to translate {{advances in}} genetics into benefits for patients. Consideration of the issues presented here when incorporating genetics into mainstream medical services will help ensure that new service developments build on the body of experience gained by the pilots, to provide high quality services for patients with or at risk of genetic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The ester-linked {{ferulic acid}} of wheat bran and {{sugar beet pulp}} can be {{converted}} to vanillin using biological transformation.

It also presents various methods of genetic analysis, such as heterokaryosis, crossing, recombinant selection from random samples of ascosporesa, and perithecium analysis and relative heterothallism. As in most other filamentous fungi in which sexual reproduction occurs, A. nidulans (Eidam) Winter, an ascomycete shows a vegetative cycle side-by-side with a sexual cycle. On germination, an uninucleate haploid vegetative spore (conidium) produces colorless septate hyphae with multinucleate cells. The sexual cycle is concentrated in specialized organs, the fruiting bodies (cleistothecia or perithecia). The biochemical genetics of A. nidulans, though {{similar to that of}} Neurospora and Ophiostoma, has revealed interesting differences in detail: e. g., the inability of citrulline to replace ornithine for strains responding to ornithine or arginine; the inability of tryptophan to replace anthranilic acid for certain strains responding to anthranilic acid or nicotinic acid; the competitive inhibition by lysine of exogenous arginine or ornithine, and its sparing effect on exogenous proline; etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{identity and}} function of the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked fertility factors have long eluded researchers. Although the D. melanogaster genome sequence was recently completed, the fertility factors still were not identified, {{in part because of}} low cloning efficiency of heterochromatic Y sequences.

Our conclusions are supported by <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> with X-Y translocation lines. Reverse transcription–PCR was successful in linking together unmapped sequence fragments from the whole-genome shotgun assembly, although some sequences were missing altogether from the shotgun effort and had to be generated de novo. We also found a previously undescribed Y gene, polycystine-related (PRY). The closest paralogs of kl- 2, kl- 3, and PRY (and also of kl- 5) are autosomal and not X-linked, suggesting that the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome has been driven by an accumulation of male-related genes arising de novo from the autosomes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether medical care providers in the Netherlands are adequately educated in genetics by collecting information about the current state of genetics education of non-genetics health care professionals. METHOD: The curricula of the 8 universities providing medical education and of all varieties of specialised medical training were examined for the year 2002. RESULTS: In most universities, the number of hours spent on genetics education is small, and genetics is relatively invisible, being integrated within several courses, comprising only a small proportion of the total course (a mean of 8 %). Only 3 of the programmes for medical specialist training and the training of medical doctors for mentally handicapped people indicated a <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> education programme. Continued education courses on genetics are offered irregularly. Training in midwifery involves at least 3 weeks of genetics education.

40|$|The <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> of {{immunoglobulins}} {{has been}} developed primarily {{through the use of}} markers that have been assigned to the constant parts of the immunoglobulin molecules (IgCL and IgCH). However, the functional antigen-binding parts of the immunoglobulins are located on the variable-region (V-region) 1 segments of the molecule and are controlled by a much larger number of IgVL and IgV ~ genes. Genetic analysis of V-region related functions is complicated by the vast numbers of different types of immunoglobulin molecules. Progress, however, has been made in this area by the use of homogeneous antibodies (1 - 5) or myeloma proteins that have known haptenbinding specificities (6 - 10). Here is has been possible to retrieve a specific functional group of immunoglobulins by their ability to bind the specific antigen. Further, the availability of homogeneous immunoglobulins in sufficient quantity has permitted both structural and antigenic studies. Homogeneous immunoglobulins have individual antigenic specificities that are located on the variable parts of the molecule which can be used to distinguish one species of immunoglobulin from all the others. These markers, called individual antigenic specificities (11) or idiotypes (12), are useful in geneti...|$|E

This study examined 2013 - 2014 trends in genetics curricula in US and Canadian medical schools to ascertain whether and how curricula are keeping pace with this rapid evolution. METHODS: Medical genetics course directors received a 60 -item electronic questionnaire covering curriculum design, assessment, remediation of failing grades, and inclusion of specific topics. RESULTS: The response rate was 74 %. Most schools teach the majority of genetics during the first 2 years, {{with an increase in}} the number of integrated curricula. Only 26 % reported <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> teaching during years 3 and 4, and most respondents felt the amount of time spent on genetics was insufficient preparation for clinical practice. Most participants are using the Association of Professors of Human and Medical Genetics Core Curriculum(1) as a guide. Topics recently added include personalized medicine (21 %) and direct-to-consumer testing (18 %), whereas eugenics (17 %), linkage analysis (16 %), and evolutionary genetics (15 %) have been recently eliminated. Remediation strategies were heterogeneous across institutions. CONCLUSION: These findings provide an important update on how genetics and genomics is taught at US and Canadian medical schools.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{presents}} our online-teaching material {{within the}} k-MED project (Knowledge in Medical Education) {{at the university}} of Marburg. It is currently organized in five e-learning modules: cytogenetics, chromosomal aberrations, <b>formal</b> <b>genetics,</b> fundamentals of molecular diagnostics, and congenital abnormalities and syndromes. These are basic courses intended to do the educational groundwork, which will enable academic teachers to concentrate on more sophisticated topics during their lectures. Methods: The e-learning modules have been offered to a large group of about 3300 students during four years at the Faculty of Medicine in Marburg. The group consists of science students (human biology) and medical students in the preclinical or the clinical period, respectively. Participants were surveyed on acceptance by evaluating user-tracking data and questionnaires. Results and Conclusion: Analysis of the evaluation data proofs the broad acceptance of the e-learning modules during eight semesters. The courses are in stable or even increasing use from winter term 2005 / 06 until spring term 2009. Conclusion: Our e-learning-model is broadly accepted among students with different levels of knowledge at the Faculty of Medicine in Marburg. If the e-learning courses are maintained thoroughly, minor adaptations can increase acceptance and usage even furthermore. Their use should be extended to the medical education of technical assistances and nurses, who work in the field of human genetics. Keywords: Human genetics, e-Learning, evaluation, multimedi...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1969. Bibliography: leaves 92 - 96. viii, 96 l illusMany of the {{recently}} discovered genetically determined polymorphisms involving isozymes of Drosophila melanogaster have been concerned with identifying the enzyme biochemically and determining the <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> of the enzyme. After the survey of several enzyme systems in natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura by Lewontin and Hubby (1966), which indicated that isozyme polymorphisms are more frequent than previously expected, there has been greater interest in population studies of these isozymes as is shown by the recent work in Drosophila melanogaster concerning the Esterase 6 polymorphism (Yarbrough and Kojima, 1967) and the alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism (Kojima and Tobari, 1969 b). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the frequencies of the amylase isozyme alleles in several natural populations of D. melanogaster, and on the success of this investigation, to attempt to see how the polymorphism might be maintained. The survey consisted of recently collected flies from natural populations of Texas and Wisconsin. In addition, the Odate population (collected in Japan four years ago and since kept in the laboratory) was also examined. For all surveys the frequency of the Amyl allele was clearly the most common (0. 80) and was followed by Amy 1, 3 (about 0. 12). Other less frequent alleles observed were Amy 2, 3, Amyl, 2, and hmy 1, 6. Because of Amyl and Amy 1, 3 being consistently the most frequent in the natural populations, the selection studies concentrated on these two alleles in the Texas and Wisconsin populations. The results of the viability and fertility experiments (for matings within and between populations) consistently demonstrated higher viability and fertility for the Amyl, 3 /Amyl, 3 genotype followed by Amyl/Amyl, 3 and Amyl/Amyl genotypes respectively. The results of the developmental study, which employed the normal sugar containing media and a special media containing starch instead of sugar, were less consistent; however, the Amyl/Amyl genotype had the slowest developmental time with the Amyl/Amyl, 3 and Amyl, 3 /Amyl, 3 genotypes being similar to each other. From these results it is difficult to see why the Amyl has such a high gene frequency in natural populations. There was some indication from one of the viability experiments that the recovery frequency of the Amyl allele among progeny is higher than that of the Amyl, 3 allele when the parents are very young, thus suggesting a prezygotic mechanism of some sort. This study, however, does not critically test for prezygotic selection and more specific tests are currently being planned...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis was to develop {{molecular}} approaches appropriate to investigate speciation processes. The genus Oenothera was chosen for study, since it offers the unique possibility to exchange plastids, individual or more chromosomes and/or even entire haploid genomes (so-called Renner complexes) between species. In addition, a rich stock of information in taxonomy, cytogenetics and <b>formal</b> <b>genetics</b> is available, collected {{for more than a}} century of research. Interspecific exchange of plastids, nuclear genomes or chromosomes often leads to mis-development of the resulting hybrids. These inviable hybrids form hybridization barriers responsible for speciation. In the case of plastid and nuclear genome exchange, hybrid bleaching is frequently observed, which results from plastome-genome incompatibility (PGI) due to compartmental co-evolution. Traditional work on Oenothera was almost exclusively restricted to classical genetic and cytogenetic approaches. Subsection Oenothera, the best studied of the five subsections in the section Oenothera, was used in this work. It is comprised of three basic nuclear genomes, A, B and C, which occur in homozygous (AA, BB, CC) or stable heterozygous (AB, AC, BC) combination. In nature, the nuclear genomes are associated with five basic, genetically discernible plastid types (I - V) in distinct combinations. The following results were obtained: (i) Biochemistry with Oenothera is not trivial due to exceedingly high amounts of mucilage and tannins which adversely interfere with the isolation of macromolecules and enzymatic reactions. A basic biochemistry for the material was therefore developed initially, notably to obtain appropriate subcellular fractions, restricable, amplifyable and clonable DNA, RNA, supramolecular protein assemblies and proteins of appropriate purity. (ii) Evaluation of the PGI literature clearly indicates that PGI can form hybridization barriers according to the Dobzhansky-Muller gene pair model of speciation, even if the genes reside in different cellular compartments. (iii) Oenothera PGIs could be classified into four genetically distinct categories, which influence hybridization barriers in different ways. (iv) Co-dominant marker systems (SSLP and CAPS) were generated for both, nuclear genome and plastome. Their potential was successfully evaluated with crossing programs designed to exchange plastomes, genomes, or individual chromosomes between species. (v) The plastome markers allowed to genotype 41 subplastomes to judge inter- and intraplastome diversity and displayed molecular loci linked to the genetic behaviour of basic plastome types I - V. (vi) A single, highly polymorphic marker (M 40) was sufficient to genotype 29 different Renner complexes of the basic genome types A, B and C. (vii) Markers specific for all seven Oenothera chromosomes were selected. Combined with the genetics of a partial permanent translocation heterozygote (ring of 12 chromosomes plus 1 bivalent, which behave as two distinct linkage groups) they allowed the assignment of molecular linkage group 7 to chromosome 9 • 8 of the classical Oenothera map. Material for the assignment of the remaining chromosomes and their arms was produced or selected so that both map types can now be fully integrated. (viii) In parallel to work on the nuclear genome, the sequences of the five basic Oenothera plastomes were completed (in cooperation). Elaborated in this thesis, due to its limited coding potential, conserved nature, and substantial knowledge about photosynthesis, plastid chromosomes provide relatively easy access to “speciation genes” and selection pressures causing speciation. (ix) Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences provided a plastome pedigree, and also an idea about the age of the subsection, i. e. back to the middle of Pleistocene, approximately 1 mya ago. This contributed to solve a long lasting question in the Oenothera literature. (x) Application of appropriate algorithms uncovered for the first time that plastomes are subject to natural selection and hence contribute to speciation. This was questioned repeatedly. (xi) A novel weighting strategy, combining classical genetic data on plastome-genome compatibility/incompatibility with molecular data and bioinformatic approaches, was applied to deduce potential plastid determinants for PGI. (xii) In a case study it could be shown that a single plastid locus contributes substantially to PGI in the interspecific hybrid AB-I, which was found to be defective in photosystem II. A plastome I-specific deletion in the bidirectional promoter region between psbB and clpP was found to be responsible for the phenotype observed. The finding is consistent with reduced levels of psbB mRNA and its product CP 47 chlorophyll a apoprotein of photosystem II, with spectroscopic data and phenotype. (xiii) Available data indicate that interspecific plastome-genome hybrids represent some sort of “network mutants”. This would imply that speciation is predominantly a regulatory phenomenon. In the studied cases PGIs are is involved in the fine-tuning of regulation of photosynthesis, rather than in an adaptation of its structural components. This is considered as a major finding of this thesis...|$|E
