5|$|The <b>demobilisation</b> of the Australian {{military}} after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the <b>demobilisation</b> process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general <b>demobilisation</b> of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The <b>demobilisation</b> process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E
5|$|The <b>demobilisation</b> {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time the {{military}} had a strength of 598,300 men and women. Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general <b>demobilisation</b> did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of <b>Demobilisation</b> and Dispersal in September.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the <b>demobilisation</b> process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the <b>demobilisation</b> process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} concentrated around Torokina in October, {{in preparation}} for post-war <b>demobilisation.</b> As its personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service, its strength dwindled. In mid-December, the battalion's remaining personnel embarked upon the transport River Loddon and sailed for Brisbane, arriving there on Christmas Eve. The <b>demobilisation</b> process continued at Chermside and the battalion was finally disbanded on 28 March 1946. The Australian War Memorial lists the battalion's casualties during the Second World War as 42 men killed and 105 wounded. Its personnel received the following decorations: two Officers of the Order of the British Empire, four MCs, two DCMs, 11 MMs and 35 MIDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} <b>demobilisation</b> began {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} hostilities, although it had partially commenced as early as 1943. At {{the end of the war}} the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men, approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area. The <b>demobilisation</b> plan was put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. Undertaken in four phases, it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged. Although the process largely proceeded smoothly, many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended. The speed of <b>demobilisation</b> was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied, the lack of sufficient shipping, the administrative workload entailed, and limited facilities for use for the <b>demobilisation</b> process. Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty. Meanwhile, in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained, full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947. The Militia, under the guise of the Citizen Military Forces, was re-established on 1 July 1948 to provide a part-time volunteer force which would be able to provide the basis for expansion in wartime.|$|E
5|$|After his <b>demobilisation,</b> Smith {{returned}} to Australia {{with his wife}} and daughter. He became a prominent figure in Melbourne's Jewish community, was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the United Australia Party in the 1931 general election.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{battalion}} {{remained in the}} Kairivu area throughout September and into early October, when the majority of {{the battalion}} moved back to Wewak. Patrols were sent out into the surrounding areas as Japanese soldiers were brought in for surrender and repatriation. Meanwhile, the <b>demobilisation</b> process began with high priority long service troops being repatriated to Australia in drafts as shipping became available. At this time, some of the battalion's personnel volunteered for service in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The majority of these were transferred to the 67th Infantry Battalion, although some also served in the 66th Infantry Battalion. By November, the battalion was down to a posted strength of just 375 personnel. On 18 December 1945, the remaining cadre of the battalion embarked for Australia. As personnel marched out of the unit – either for <b>demobilisation</b> or for subsequent service – and equipment was handed back, the unit was disbanded at Puckapunyal in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{unexpectedly}} strong {{success of}} the Victory Tests, the government of Australia ordered the team to delay their <b>demobilisation.</b> With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via India and Ceylon for further fundraising matches for the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>demobilisation,</b> Maxwell {{worked as}} a {{gardener}} in Canberra, Moree and the Maitland district. Having {{described himself as a}} reporter, Maxwell married 19-year-old tailoress Mabel Maxwell (unrelated) in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill, Sydney on 14 February 1921. The marriage produced a daughter, Jean, before being dissolved in 1926 upon Mabel's instigation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, the <b>demobilisation</b> process {{began and}} {{eventually}} the 3rd Division was disbanded on 4 December 1945. During the division's campaign in Bougainville, one of its soldiers, Reg Rattey, earned the Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting around Slater's Knoll.|$|E
5|$|The Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern <b>demobilisation</b> on 12June 1944. The {{key element of}} these principles was that {{the order in which}} personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system, with service men and women being allocated points {{on the basis of their}} period of service, age, marital status and employment or training prospects. An extensive <b>demobilisation</b> plan was then developed by an inter-service committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6March 1945. The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} was rapidly demobilised after the Japanese surrender. At {{the end of}} the war the military had a strength of nearly 600,000personnel, of whom 224,000 were serving in the Pacific and 20,000 in Britain and other places. <b>Demobilisation</b> planning had begun at the end of 1942 with the final scheme being approved by the Government in March 1945. General <b>demobilisation</b> started on 1 October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The process generally ran smoothly, though there were protests over delays at Morotai and Bougainville. Personnel were provided with training while they waited to be demobilised and the government provided post-demobilisation assistance with employment, loans, education and other benefits. Service women were given similar assistance to their male counterparts, but were placed under pressure to return to 'traditional' family roles.|$|E
5|$|The final <b>demobilisation</b> plan {{assigned}} differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for <b>demobilisation,</b> followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{remained}} DGMS {{after the}} war. In the immediate post-war period, {{he was responsible}} for the <b>demobilisation</b> of the Army Medical Services, and for providing medical support to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Criticism of the medical arrangements, which Burston felt might lead to the force being prematurely withdrawn, led to Burston being publicly rebuked by the Army Minister, Cyril Chambers. Burston retired as DGMS and from the Army in 1948, handing over to Kingsley Norris. He served as honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps from 1952 to 1957.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in mid-August, the {{fighting}} on Borneo {{came to an}} end following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan. After this the 2/9th Battalion carried out various garrison duties such as guarding prisoners of war and maintaining internal security while the <b>demobilisation</b> process took place. As personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service, the battalion's strength dropped until it was finally disbanded on 3 January 1946 while still at Balikpapan.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement so that it could begin the repatriation of the AIF early. Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director-General of Repatriation and <b>Demobilisation</b> and oversaw the process in Britain, while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the division was disbanded in December 1945 {{as part of the}} <b>demobilisation</b> process, but was it later re-raised in 1948 as part of the Citizens Military Force. It subsequently served through the Cold War as a reserve formation until 1991 when the division was disbanded for a final time as the Australian Army was restructured and the focus of Australian field force operations shifted from the divisional-level to brigades.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, the <b>demobilisation</b> process {{began and}} slowly the battalion's numbers began to dwindle as its {{personnel}} were repatriated back to Australia and returned to civilian life. The 23rd Battalion was disbanded in Belgium on 30 April 1919. Throughout its service during the war, it suffered 686 killed and 2,317 wounded (including gassed). For its involvement during the war, the 23rd Battalion received a total of 19 battle honours; these were bestowed upon the battalion in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In December 1945, {{most of the}} {{battalion}} (except one platoon) was withdrawn to New Britain to rejoin the 11th Brigade. In February 1946, the platoon that had remained on Nauru arrived in Rabaul. As the <b>demobilisation</b> process began, the 31st/51st stayed on New Britain until May when they received orders to return to Australia. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Donald Lamb took over as battalion commander. As personnel were discharged or transferred to other units for further service, {{the battalion}}'s numbers declined until eventually, on 4 July 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Limited <b>demobilisation</b> began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the war economy 20,000 {{soldiers}} were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas, {{along with}} his Stars in Battledress unit, {{travelled}} through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months. After the tour, and with his <b>demobilisation</b> approaching, he took compassionate leave {{in order to have}} free time while still receiving army pay. During his absence he went {{on a tour of the}} UK organised by George Black, accompanied on the piano by a former colonel, Harry Sutcliffe. Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The 34th Battalion was {{initially}} used for garrison duties on Fiji and New Caledonia before being {{committed to the}} fighting in the Solomon Islands, briefly seeing combat against the Japanese in the Treasury Islands in late 1943. Returned to New Zealand in mid-1944 and was disbanded later that year {{as part of a}} partial <b>demobilisation</b> of New Zealand forces. Many of its personnel returned to civilian employment while others were sent to Italy as reinforcements for the New Zealand 2nd Division. The battalion was awarded three battle honours for its service during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} undertook {{its last}} major {{action of the}} war {{at the end of}} September 1918 when, serving alongside the Americans, they breached parts of the Hindenburg Line along the St Quentin Canal. During this final battle, the battalion's long serving commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henderson, who had taken command in February 1917 before the battalion's first major battle, was killed in action. Late on 2 October, while around Gillemont Crescent, the 39th was relieved and the battalion was removed from the line to undertake training and reorganisation. In the middle of October, the 39th was bolstered by a company of reinforcements from the 37th, which had been disbanded to help make up losses in the other 10th Brigade units. Nevertheless, the 39th did not see action again and they were still at the rear when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. With the fighting over, the process of <b>demobilisation</b> began and slowly the men began marching out for repatriation to Australia. Finally, in March 1919, the 39th Battalion was disbanded. At this point, the battalion's remaining personnel were amalgamated with other units to form the 10th <b>Demobilisation</b> Regiment, with the last of its soldiers returning to Australia in May.|$|E
5|$|The <b>demobilisation</b> of the {{military}} included disbanding the female branches of the three services. The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, Australian Women's Army Service and Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force had been formed during 1941 and 1942 to enable women to serve in {{the military}} but were disbanded during 1947, with military service being again restricted to men. Demobilised service women were provided with similar assistance to male members {{of the military}}, but were placed under pressure to return to traditional family roles.|$|E
5|$|Upon Fleming's <b>demobilisation</b> in May 1945, {{he became}} the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley {{newspaper}} group, {{which at the time}} owned The Sunday Times. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take three months holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica. Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.|$|E
5|$|Upon Fleming's <b>demobilisation</b> in May 1945, {{he became}} the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley {{newspaper}} group, {{which at the time}} owned The Sunday Times. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take two months holiday every winter in Jamaica. In 1948 Charteris gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was stillborn; Charteris and Fleming became engaged shortly in 1951.|$|E
5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following <b>demobilisation.</b> On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{remained}} {{active in}} the military, continuing to serve {{as part of the}} Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the <b>demobilisation</b> process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing tensions in Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing his concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Demobilisation</b> also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war <b>demobilisation</b> saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese surrender, the 27th Battalion ceased {{operations}} and was transported to Torokina, {{where they had}} to wait for shipping to become available for repatriation back to Australia to begin the <b>demobilisation</b> process. This process began in October 1945, albeit slowly, and gradually the battalion's numbers decreased as men were repatriated back to Australia or were transferred to other units for further service. Long service men received priority for discharge, while some men volunteered to be transferred to the battalions of the 34th Brigade that were being formed on Morotai Island for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Finally, on 1 May 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, No.2 OTU was reduced {{to the status of}} a care and maintenance unit, and Jeffrey's commission was terminated on 6June 1946. Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his <b>demobilisation,</b> he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year, without success. He then took up farming, purchasing a property on the Murray River. In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF and this time was granted a commission as a wing commander. Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria, firstly at the RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, and in 1952 at Central Flying School, East Sale. The following year he became Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, the Australian government decided {{that it would not}} contribute to the proposed Allied occupation force in Germany and would begin the process of <b>demobilisation</b> of the AIF as soon as possible. Owing to the large number of soldiers deployed overseas, this process took some time, and it was decided to progressively return men from each battalion, rather than send them home as a formed unit. As numbers dwindled, units were amalgamated for administrative purposes, and as a consequence the 9th and 10th Battalions were merged on 5 February 1919; the final contingent of troops from the 10th Battalion did not return home until September 1919 when they disembarked in Adelaide from the transport Takada.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the 61st Battalion {{took part in the}} surrender ceremony that took place at Torokina. Later, as they were waiting for repatriation back to Australia, the battalion was employed guarding Japanese prisoners of war. In November orders arrived for the battalion to return to Australia and after embarking on the Westralia, they landed at Cairns on 19 November 1945, and moved back to Brisbane by train. As the battalion's strength dwindled {{as a result of the}} <b>demobilisation</b> process and men returned to civilian life, the decision was made to disband the unit. This occurred on 8 January 1946 at Victoria Barracks, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the battalion moved to the island of Fauro to guard Japanese prisoners of war. As the <b>demobilisation</b> process began, members of the battalion were slowly repatriated to Australia, while others were transferred to other units for further service elsewhere. By March 1946 {{the last of the}} battalion's personnel had been returned to Australia and on 10 May 1946, the 7th Battalion was formally disbanded. During its service throughout the war the battalion lost 25 men killed or died on active service, with a further 50 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, one MC, one MM and 16 MIDs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the AIF was disbanded and {{the focus}} of Australia's {{military}} forces was the units of the Citizens Force. Between 1918 and 1921, as the <b>demobilisation</b> process was completed, this force existed in a state of flux, however, in 1921 planning for the post war Army was finally completed. On 1 May 1921 the 3rd Division was re-raised in Victoria as part of the 3rd Military District. Upon formation it consisted of three four-battalion brigades—the 4th Brigade, 10th Brigade and 15th Brigade—and various supporting units including artillery, engineers, signals, transport and medical.|$|E
