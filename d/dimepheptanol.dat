50|$|<b>Dimepheptanol</b> is {{a mixture}} of two isomers, {{alphamethadol}} (α-methadol) and betamethadol (β-methadol). These are also available separately, and this drug has three separate entries in many national and international lists of illegal drugs, which refer to the racemic mixture <b>dimepheptanol,</b> and the two optical isomers. Each of these isomers is itself a mixture of two isomers, and so there are in fact four isomers of <b>dimepheptanol</b> in total; L-α-methadol, D-α-methadol, L-β-methadol and D-β-methadol.|$|E
50|$|The isomer L-α-methadol is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of the long-acting opioid substitute drug levomethadyl acetate (LAAM), {{and has been}} used much more widely than β-methadol or the racemic mixture of <b>dimepheptanol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimepheptanol</b> (INN; Amidol, Pangerin), {{also known}} as methadol or racemethadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic related to methadone. It has similar effects to other opioids, including analgesia, sedation and euphoria, as well as side effects like itching, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Betamethadol (INN), or β-methadol, {{also known}} as betametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of <b>dimepheptanol</b> (methadol), the other being alphamethadol (α-methadol). Betamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-β-methadol, and D-β-methadol. Based on structure-activity relationships it can be inferred that both isomers {{are likely to be}} active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of betacetylmethadol (β-acetylmethadol).|$|E
50|$|Alphamethadol (INN), or α-methadol, {{also known}} as alfametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of <b>dimepheptanol</b> (methadol), the other being betamethadol (β-methadol). Alphamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-α-methadol, and D-α-methadol. The former compound, L-α-methadol, is an important active metabolite of levacetylmethadol (LAAM), an opioid substitute drug that is used clinically. Both of alphamethadol's isomers bind to and activate the μ-opioid receptor and are active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol).|$|E
