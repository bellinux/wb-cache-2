25|$|The 'Spirit of America' Nova was {{introduced}} in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. Oldsmobile and Buick entered the compact car market; both the Apollo and Omega debuted, using the same bodystyles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment.</b> Pontiac's final GTO of this era {{was based on a}} facelifted 1974 Ventura coupe, itself based on the Nova, but fitted with a shaker hoodscoop from the Trans Am.|$|E

City officials initially blamed a technical problem.

Recognising the Master-Braces, Diver accompanied Ginrai and explained their significance to him, only {{for them to be}} attacked by the Decepticon Godmasters, Buster and Hydra, and forced over a cliff. Accidentally touching the bracelets as he attempted to escape the crushed cab, Ginrai was infused with the Masterforce and a suit of armor materialised around him, healing both himself and the Transtector, as they combined and transformed. Harnessing a Godmaster's natural ability to manipulate Chokon Power - the energy of the heavens (Tenchokon), the Earth (Chichokon) and man (Jinchokon) - Ginrai saw off the Decepticons, and, after a period of deliberation, after which he decided that becoming a Godmaster was the will of God himself, he joined the Autobots.|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{preformed}} as a master degree thesis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> engineering program Ergonomic Design and Production at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The project was assigned by Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) in Gothenburg and carried out at Cross Design AB. The purpose {{of the project was}} to investigate how storage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front part of the Volvo models S 80, V 70, XC 70 and XC 90 could be improved and optimised. The project should result in one storage solution concept. The procedure of the project was based on a combined methodology of the Sirius Masterplan Design Process and Systematic Problem Solving. To find <b>the</b> existing needs <b>in</b> car storage a survey was performed on a group of 20 car drivers who represented the target group of potential buyers. To make sure to receive extensive information both questionnaires, interviews and observations were carried out. In order to incorporate inspiration and an overview of the range of products on the market the team carried out a benchmarking of most of the leading car makes in Sweden. Related technologies were also studied to find new angles of approach and {{to increase the number of}} ideas. An analysis of how the car will be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future was performed as well as a general trend analysis of peoples life styles and habits. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> surveys it was found that people are spending more and more time in their cars and that it is becoming important to provide for other needs than the traditional. The studied cars are often used for longer trips at work or on vacation. This creates a need for possibilities for storing office equipment and to have easy access to beverage and food. The idea generation was carried out through the methods of brainstorming, categorising and and adjusted form of the Delphi method and resulted in a wide range of storing solutions. To narrow down the project it was decided to focus only on <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment,</b> <b>the</b> area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the dashboard, and on the area behind the centre stack. Several concepts were put together for each of these areas on the basis of the previously developed ideas. It was decided to proceed with the development of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> concepts. These were to be applied on the coming XC 90 which has <b>the</b> largest <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> volume of VCC’s cars. <b>The</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> concepts were compared to previously stated product demands and wishes as well as to each other. The ones with the most innovative ideas and best scores were extracted and supplemented with good ideas from other concepts. The selection specially focused on flexibility, organisation and individualisation possibilities as well as innovation. A combination of concepts ended up with a notch and a case concept, which both could be supplemented with a so called sleigh for easier access. Since both concepts and combinations lived up to the demands the final concept choice was based on calculated scores as well as which was considered to be the most innovative. On these grounds the case concept, called <b>the</b> <b>Glove</b> <b>Compartment</b> Case (GCC), was elected. The GCC consists of two removable cases: one cooling unit and one organised unit. The concept fulfils the wishes of flexibility, organisation and individuality since it allows the user to organise <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> after occasion and stored items.

50|$|A car key or an {{automobile}} key {{is a key}} used to open and/or start {{an automobile}}. Modern key designs are usually symmetrical, and some use grooves on both sides, rather than a cut edge, to actuate the lock. It has multiple uses for the automobile with which it was sold. A car key can open the doors, as well as start the ignition, open <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> <b>compartment</b> and also open the trunk (boot) of the car. Some cars come with an additional key known as a valet key that starts the ignition and opens the driver's side door, but prevents the valet from gaining access to valuables that are located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trunk or <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box. Some valet keys, particularly those to high-performance vehicles, {{go so far as}} to restrict the engine's power output to prevent joyriding. Recently, features such as coded immobilizers have been implemented in newer vehicles. More sophisticated systems make ignition dependent on electronic devices, rather than the mechanical keyswitch. A number of these systems, such as KeeLoq and Megamos Crypto have been demonstrated to be weak and vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks.|$|R
