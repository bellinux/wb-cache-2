30|$|As {{students}} {{appeared to}} be extrinsically motivated by assessment, TELTs were not used a lot for general interest (Table  3). All of the TELTs {{had the capacity to}} be used on mobile devices, however they were used primarily on PCs/laptops (Table  3). This may suggest that the potential for incidental or informal learning was not enhanced by using the TELTs. Each TELT was accessed mostly at home, therefore perhaps promoting <b>extra-curricular</b> <b>study</b> as it was hoped that the ShowMe videos would, but still in a formal and structured fashion. However, these points are speculative as we have no comparison to their learning habits prior to the study. Furthermore ‘general interest’ is quite vague and open to individual interpretation. Perhaps this would have been better termed ‘further study’ or ‘further understanding’.|$|R

40|$|Nearly 20 % of all fifth-year pupils {{apply for}} entry to eight-year gymnasium, but {{fewer than half}} of them are successful. The vast {{majority}} apply {{on the basis of their}} own and their parents‘ joint interests. Preparation for the entry exams is a burden both for the children and their parents, whether in the form of lost free time, or in terms of financial outlayings for tutoring, preparatory courses and practice tests. Nearly 85 % of those enrolled to take the entry examinations dedicate time weekly to their preparation, and each day sees almost one in two of these pupils busy with preparation. Intensive preparation vastly increases the likelihood of acceptance for the lowerachieving half of candidates. For the higher-achieving half, intensive preparation is rather an insurance measure, to ensure that the very hard-working candidates from the lower half will not overtake them. There are many indications that intensive <b>extra-curricular</b> <b>study</b> in preparation for the entry examinations for eight-year gymnasium significantly improves pupils‘ knowledge and skills. In this, will power, perseverance, ambition, rigour and pressure from the parents play a significant role...|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} provides preliminary yet powerful {{evidence for}} the benefit of performance psychology skills training in undergraduate music performance education to increase students’ capacity to cope with escalations in debilitating MPA, and boost overall performance resilience. Positive outcomes may have been assisted by the thorough assessment of each students’ performance psychology skills using the PSI, which maps directly to the strategies given in the workbook, providing targeted areas for improvement. The online methodology of the PSI and comprehensive workbook enables a very user-directed method for students to identify weaknesses and strengths, without placing too great an administrative burden on teaching or administrative staff. That said, the efforts to engage students in an <b>extra-curricular</b> research <b>study</b> within a heavily timetabled curriculum meant that the participation rate in this study was low.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{researches}} {{excellence in}} higher education by looking into honours programmes (HPs) in Dutch higher education. HPs are selective and aimed at the brightest students, offering them a more challenging – often <b>extra-curricular</b> – <b>study</b> experience. Based on a survey (n= 259) at Dutch universities, our study identifies three types of honours students: task-committed, above-average ability, and creative. We asked each group how their ideal HP looks like. Task-committed students are interested in disciplinary HPs that have a student-centred approach. The above-average ability students demand a highly selective and small-scale HP that admits only the brightest students. Moreover, they prefer a HP that is isolated from regular study programmes. Creative students are interested {{in a variety of}} disciplinary subjects, not offered in regular curricula, often requiring substantial amounts of extra time and effort. The differences in preferred configurations of HPs have policy implications for universities interested in introducing excellence educatio...|$|R

50|$|His {{knowledge}} and experience in Canadian politics led to the commissioning {{of a history of}} federal election campaigns in Canada from 1974 onward. These essays were the basis of his 2005 book, The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics. Clarkson was renowned for his teaching, receiving many teaching awards in his tenure at the University of Toronto. He was a great encourager of “the engaged” life, taking his students on <b>extra-curricular</b> field <b>studies</b> to Washington, D.C. and Mexico, and urging them to resist the world around them if they felt so inclined. Clarkson was a frequent commentator of Canadian politics, in both English and French. A lover of languages, he was also proficient in Spanish, German, Russian and Italian. Clarkson earned a B.A. from the University of Toronto, an M.A. from New College, Oxford, and a D. de Rech. from the University of Paris. He was a Senior Fellow at Massey College, a Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) in Waterloo, Ontario and, in 2004, was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2010, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada.|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: In 2000 {{our medical}} school {{introduced}} a selection procedure (SP) for 10 % of the otherwise randomly selected (RS) applicants. Students with excellent high school {{grade point averages}} (GPAs) were allowed direct access (DA) to our medical school. The selection procedure focused on medical comprehension, social and ethical understanding of health care, and communication and interpersonal skills. Objectives We aimed to establish how SP students compared with RS and DA students on motivation, academic achievement, study behaviour and extracurricular activities, and how these variables were interrelated within these groups. METHODS: In 2003, all Year 1 and 2 students were given a questionnaire on motivation, <b>study</b> behaviour and <b>extra-curricular</b> activities. Primary year GPAs were obtained from our administration department. Student groups were compared using descriptive statistics. The interrelationship between outcomes was tested using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 418 students (76 %). Selection procedure students were significantly more highly motivated (59. 4) than RS students (56. 6) and DA students (52. 1). This was not reflected in academic achievement (6. 7), which was highest among DA students (7. 2). Selection procedure students carried out more extra-curricular activities, often health care-related, and displayed more study behaviour. Academic achievement could not be explained by motivation and study behaviour but motivation affected study behaviour and health care-related extra-curricular activities. CONCLUSIONS: The more profound commitment of selected students to health care is not primarily reflected in academic achievement but in motivation, <b>extra-curricular</b> activities and <b>study</b> behaviour. Follow-up research including all pre-clinical and clinical years should demonstrate the stability of these characteristics and their effects on graduates' post-qualification clinical performance as practising doctor...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{clearing}} {{system in the}} UK enables students without a university place after exam results have been announced to find suitable vacancies, as {{it is important for}} universities to fill their vacancies as any shortfall loses them a lot of money. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine marketing strategies adopted by UK universities on their websites during clearing. - Design/methodology/approach – In total, the content of 134 university websites were analysed a few weeks before clearing and the day before clearing starts. The categories for the analysis included membership of the three main university groups as well as clearing advertisement strategies and advertising theme presented. - Findings – In total, 110 universities indicated interest in admitting students through clearing on their websites including 18 of the 24 Russell University Group although more emphasis was laid on adjustment to attract students with better grades. The majority of websites were redesigned to reflect clearing with slides highlighting student satisfaction, guaranteed accommodation and graduate employability. Research limitations/implications – This exploratory study examines advertising strategies adopted during clearing, it would be interesting to also seek a broader view on advertisement strategies adopted by the universities throughout the year and extended to a comparative study of higher education marketing across different countries. - Originality/value – As websites have become an integral part of the marketing tools of universities, they should present information relevant to different stakeholders creatively, along with images reflecting their diverse student body and <b>extra-curricular</b> environment. This <b>study</b> will be relevant to university staff dealing with marketing, recruitment and information technology, advertising practitioners and academic researchers...|$|R
40|$|The last {{comprehensive}} {{survey of}} physical education in secondary schools in Scotland was undertaken in 1989 (Sharp, 1991 a, b). Since then, a number of national developments in Scotland focusing on {{sport and physical education}} have taken place, viz., development of certificated physical education (Fryer, 1991), establishment of the School Sports Co-ordinator Programme (Coalter andThorburn, 2003) and the introduction of a National framework for courses and qualifications in Secondary schools (Scottish Qualifications Authority, 2003 a). The present study examined the changes that have taken place since 1989 in regard to five key areas - departmental composition, courses in physical education, time allocation, facilities and <b>extra-curricular</b> provision. The <b>study</b> showed a continuing malelfemale teacher imbalance, especially at promoted level, but {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of female teachers. In regard to course provision, the study showed a significant increase in the number of schools offering certificated physical education. It was concluded that the physical education profession has responded positively to the changes bought about by certification and the revised National course framework. In regard to time allocation, an overall increase was noted although there are variations across years. The reduction in core physical education in the first two years of Secondary school is a concern. The study revealed a continuing 'decline in access to facilities and extra-curricular provision. In summary, it is recommended that serious concerns such as reduced time for core physical education and access to facilities should be made known to the key agencies in Scotland which can influence provision for physical education in schools. The study recommends further, that in light of the number of ongoing national developments, the time interval before the next nationwide survey should be shorter than that between the 1989 study and the present one...|$|R

He also played the violin and the piano. [...] Studying first at Kingston College, Hull and then at the West Riding Proprietary School at Wakefield, he matriculated, as the second 'Dikes Scholar' (the second beneficiary after his elder brother, Thomas, of an endowment established in 1840 in honour of his grandfather) [...] at Katharine Hall (later St. Catharine's College, Cambridge). Here, as an <b>extra-curricular</b> subject, he <b>studied</b> music under Thomas Attwood Walmisley, whose madrigal society he joined. He also joined the Peterhouse Musical Society renamed the http://www.cums.org.uk/ Cambridge University Musical Society, becoming its forth President, immediately following his friend, the physicist William Thomson (later to become the 1st Baron Kelvin). Although we know, from his diaries and correspondence, from Fowler, and from reports in the Press, that a number of his part-songs were performed by the CUMS, these are currently lost. Graduating in 1847 as a Senior Optime, he was appointed to the curacy of Malton, North Yorkshire in 1847. Ordained Deacon at York Minster in January 1848, in the following year he was appointed a minor canon of Durham Cathedral (an appointment he held until his death), and shortly thereafter to the office of precentor.

40|$|The study {{described}} {{the current status}} of public school gifted programs in a sample of 151 school districts in the State of Nebraska. The purpose of the research was to identify and describe program provisions for gifted and talented students in Nebraska based on the use of a gifted program evalution model and a review of the related literature. ^ The survey instrument collected information from 151 program coordinators, superintendents or principals. Respondents rated the extent of gifted program design, implementation and evaluation practices. Additional questions covered identification, curriculum, human and material resources, program prototypes and other requirements deemed necessary characteristics of gifted programs. The total number of identified gifted students in the 151 reporting districts was 20, 860. One hundred sixteen (77 percent) of the school districts had elementary 1 - 6 programs, 73 districts (48 percent) had programs in grades 7 - 8, and 60 districts (40 percent) had secondary 9 - 12 programs. Multiple methods of identification were used in 97 percent of the districts. ^ Major organizational structures were enrichment in the regular classroom, independent <b>study,</b> <b>extra-curricular</b> school offerings and individual counseling. Least used structures were alternative schools and advanced placement. ^ Major differentiated curricula across all grades were language arts, science, mathematics, computer education and creativity. Ranking lowest in the elementary programs were foreign language and leadership. At the {{middle school and high school}} levels the least offered curricula were visual and performing arts, leadership and foreign language. ^ Fifty percent of the district-level gifted program respondents anticipated that the gifted program in their district would be expanded throughout the 19802 ̆ 7 s. Survey results indicate that gifted programs in Nebraska are implemented in most larger class schools despite changing school and financial conditions. Critical issues derived from the study focus on the need for increased financial resources, staff development activities and the need for educators to become more proficient in gifted program evaluation practices. ...|$|R
