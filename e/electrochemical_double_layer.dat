A new analytical formula is derived to rationalize the potential dependence of double-layer capacitance at a planar metal-ionic liquid interface. The theory behind it has a mean-field character, based on the Poisson-Boltzmann lattice-gas model, with a modification to account for the finite volume occupied by ions.

30|$|Silicon (Si), {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in earth, has been widely used in electronics and solar industries due to its low price and well-developed application knowledge. To achieve maximized SSA, {{a wide variety of}} methods have been proposed to fabricate silicon nanostructures using top-down or bottom-up approaches, for example, vapor-liquid-sold (VLS) deposition, reactive ion etching (RIE), electrochemical etching, or metal-assisted chemical etching [11 – 14]. Among these techniques, electrochemical etching is chosen to synthesize porous Si (PSi) under an atmospheric and low-temperature environment with controllable thicknesses and porosities through the etching current and the duration. However, compared with pristine doped wafers, the porous-structured electrode suffers from poor electric conductivities, largely due to surface traps [15] and deteriorated stability because of its high reactivity caused by enlarged surface area [16]. These shortcomings affect the charges inducible in the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> and limit the lifetime of the PSi-based EDLC. Therefore, protection of the electrode and enhancement of its conductivity are required to improve the capacitive performances of the PSi-based EDLCs.

40|$|The {{development}} of a high-performance oxygen electrode for SOFCs {{in order to achieve}} high power density at a stack level is still challenging. It is important to emphasize the factors controlling the efficiency of the cathode. Over the intrinsic electro-catalytic activity of the cathode material itself toward the oxygen reduction, the microstructural parameters such as the porosity, the tortuosity or the particle size are of major importance in the definition of the electrochemical active surface area. In this paper we focus on the behavior of La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -α (LSCF) -Ce 1 -xGdxO 2 -α (CGO) composite cathodes with different development and characterization of composite cathodes produced by suspension spraying and sintering, with or without further surface modification by infiltration either LSCF or CGO nano-particles. Different symmetrical cells were produced by varying the LSCF/CGO ratio with an active surface area of about 12. 57 cm 2.

40|$|A {{passive system}} {{that may be}} useful for {{measuring}} electrochemical changes occurring in in vivo, extracellular plant tissue has been developed within the past few years. The technique involves the placement of a small (250 μm diameter) noble metal probe into the anatomical region of interest. The electrode potential of this probe is then established relative to a reference electrode. The time variation of this potential (up to 100 mV or more per day) is termed an electrophytogram. The changes are coherent and reproducible. In this dissertation theoretical physiological bases for the voltage fluctuations have been developed. One theory involves modeling the electrophytogram as a chemical thermodynamic system passing {{through a series of}} "frozen" equilibria. The electron is considered as the chemical species of interest in this system and changes in the redox potential are interpreted in terms of an electron electrochemical potential (μ̃ₑ). The relationship between changes in the electrochemical nature of the solution contiguous with the probe and the μ̃ₑ intensity variable is then represented for several limiting cases. In the case of a redox reaction accompanied by a proton exchange, the limiting equation shows that pH changes well within the physiological range for extracellular plant fluid can account for the observed voltage fluctuations. An alternative representation of the electrophytogram as an electrostatic field phenomenon is more difficult to analyze {{due to a lack of}} information about the three dimensional structure and the probe/tissue interface. However, a cylindrical capacitor model shows that fluxes in the range of a few hundred monovalent ions per um³ of extracellular volume could easily explain the measured voltage changes. The third model involves the polyelectrolyte gel nature of the plant cell wall. The electrophytogram voltage signal is considered to result from surface interactions between the metal probe and the cell wall. This interaction is analyzed by using the theory of interacting <b>electrochemical</b> <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> Output from a computer simulation shows that if these two surfaces approach within two Debye lengths, a voltage signal will be generated at the electrophytogram probe. Furthermore, slight fluctuations in the surface to surface distance result in voltage fluctuations of a magnitude equal to those observed in vivo. Physiological processes known to occur in plants are discussed with respect to the generation of electrochemical potential gradients and other physical conditions necessary to "drive" the various models. I conclude that the electrophytogram is most likely the result of surface interactions between the probe and the polyelectrolyte gel components of the cell wall. Elucidation of the physiological basis for electrophytograms must also involve an accurate anatomical interpretation of the position of the probe relative to the plant tissue. Therefore the results of a freeze-fracture electron microscopic (FFSEM) examination of the probe/tissue interface after wound healing are included. Electron micrographs show cell wall material appressed directly against the probe, indicating that the electrophytogram provides a method for monitoring the electrochemical status of the cell wall space. Since cell wall material is hygroscopic, it is reasonable to assume that the smallest probe/tissue separation distance observed in the FFSEM's represents a maximum in vivo value. Since this distance is less than 10 nm, these data support the hypothesis that the metal surface is within two Debye lengths of the cell wall surface in vivo. Insertion of the probe into mature, fully elongated tissue appears to cause minimal damage to nonxylem tissue beyond the adjacent cell layers and virtually no damage to the xylem region...|$|R

The in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements reveal that the Au(111) surface undergoes a reconstruction, and at − 1. 2 V versus Pt quasi-reference the famous (22 × √ 3) herringbone superstructure is probed. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that multiple ion pair layers are present at the ionic liquid/Au interface which are dependent on the electrode potential. Upon applying cathodic electrode potentials, stronger ionic liquid near surface structure is detected: both the number of near surface layers and the force required to rupture these layers increases.

At first, the <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> which have unipolar structures are formed. And then the <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> turn into bipolar structures, which will couple with another new weak bipolar structure. Thus a new <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> or tripolar structure comes into being. The <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> found in our work are about several ten Debye lengths, which accords with the observation results. It is suggested that the electron beam formed during the magnetic reconnection is responsible for the production of the <b>double</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R
