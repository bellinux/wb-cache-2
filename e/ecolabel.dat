Its farming is also considered as having negative impacts on the environment. <b>Ecolabelling</b> is a tool used for more environmental responsibility of the industry. It is based on a win-win strategy for the farmer/fisherman, the consumers and the environment. The objective of this work is (i) to analyse the perception by consumers of the environmental problems associated with some productions in fisheries and aquaculture, including shrimps and (ii) to identify a possible premium for <b>ecolabelled</b> shrimps. A survey (302 people interviewed) showed that there is a market for <b>ecolabelled</b> shrimps in and around the city of Brest (France). Most of the people interviewed said they are concerned by environmental issues and that they know about the concept of <b>ecolabels.</b> They also declare that they buy <b>ecolabelled</b> products to act in favour of the environment protection.
