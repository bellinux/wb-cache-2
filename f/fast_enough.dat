50|$|As {{a result}} of the impact, over 167,000 {{government}} workers, including thousands of military reserves, were mobilized to search for survivors, as well as repair roads, waterways, buildings, and power lines. Most of the homeless were housed in relief centers. Approximately 100 angry farmers blocked a road with vehicles near the southern town of Sanchong to complain that they were not getting emergency aid <b>faster</b> <b>enough</b> and also demanded full compensation for destroyed homes and crops. In response, the government agreed to provide $237 million in aid, $25 million of which came from the federal government, and the rest was raised via bonds. Fishermen and farmers who suffered property losses were allowed to borrow up to a $3,720-interest free loan from banks and were also awarded a tax break. The government also paid $3,720 to the families of those who died.|$|R

However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> to steam with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for determining spacecraft attitude and autonomously calibrating star camera, both independent of each other, {{is presented in}} this paper. Unlike most of the attitude determination algorithms where attitude of the satellite depend on the camera calibrating parameters (like principal point offset, focal length etc.), the proposed method {{has the advantage of}} computing spacecraft attitude independently of camera calibrating parameters except lens distortion. In the proposed method both attitude estimation and star camera calibration is done together independent of each other by directly utilizing the star coordinate in image plane and corresponding star vector in inertial coordinate frame. Satellite attitude, camera principal point offset, focal length (in pixel), lens distortion coefficient are found by a simple two step method. In the first step, all parameters (except lens distortion) are estimated using a closed-form solution based on a distortion free camera model. In the second step lens distortion coefficient is estimated by linear least squares method using the solution of the first step {{to be used in the}} camera model that incorporates distortion. These steps are applied in an iterative manner to refine the estimated parameters. The whole procedure is <b>faster</b> <b>enough</b> for onboard implementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{space between}} the planets in the Solar System is {{continuously}} permeated by a supermagnetosonic, magnetized plasma, the solar wind. This is the outward expansion of the Suns atmosphere. Furthermore, the Suns sporadically emits huge coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that disturb the solar wind. When the interplanetary remnants of these CMEs are <b>faster</b> <b>enough,</b> shock waves are driven. These shock waves are observed as abrupt variations in solar wind plasma ad magnetic field parameters. As one consequence, when these shock waves pass by Earth, cosmic ray decreases are observed by ground based detectors. It is {{the aim of this}} work to study interplanetary shock waves effects on cosmic rays measured at ground level. Interplanetary shocks are identified and their parameters determined using the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) plasma and magnetic field instruments. Cosmic rays decreases are studied using the Muon Detector Multidirectional telescope MDM, installed at the Southern Space Observatory- OES/CRS/CCR/INPE-MCTI, in So Martinho da Serra-RS, Brazil. The period of analysis is from January 2006 to July 2011. The amplitude of cosmic ray decreases is correlated to the shock strength, as measured by density and magnetic field plasma compressions. The results are compared with previous published works...|$|R

5000|$|Electron {{transfer}} self-exchange rates can be {{also determined}} with the experimental value of line-width and chemical shift. Sharp peaks of diamagnetic compounds can be broadened during the electron transfer with its partner paramagnetic compound (one-electron oxidized species), since paramagnetic compounds exhibit broader peaks {{at a different}} chemical shift. If their self-exchange rate is <b>faster</b> <b>enough</b> than the NMR timescale, the line-broadening of the peaks is observed at shifted chemical shifts in the spectrum.

The broadened line-widths are proportional to mole fraction, and the equation can be used to determine self-exchange rate with the value of mole fraction, chemical shift and line-width: ,where [...] is the rate constant of electron transfer self-exchange, [...] and [...] are the mole fractions of diamgnetic and paramagnetic compounds, [...] is the chemical shift difference (in Hz) between pure diamagnetic and paramagnetic compounds, and [...] is the half-width of the peak (width at half height) of the selected peak.
