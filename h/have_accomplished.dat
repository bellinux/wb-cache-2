5|$|Three {{players have}} led their league in wins six times during their careers. Grover Cleveland Alexander led the National League in {{victories}} six times, with a single-season career-high 33 wins in 1916. In the American League, two pitchers <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> the same feat: Walter Johnson, whose 36 wins in 1913—his first season leading the league—were a single-season career high, and Bob Feller.|$|E

5|$|Five {{players have}} scored two World Cup hat-tricks, Savea {{being the only}} one to have scored all of them in the same tournament. Of the six teams in the Six Nations and four in the Rugby Championship teams, only Italy have failed to score a hat-trick at the World Cup. Fiji, Namibia and Samoa are the only other teams to score a hat-trick, which were scored by Vereniki Goneva, Kotze and Alesana Tuilagi, respectively. Goneva and Kotze's hat-tricks are the only time players on {{opposing}} teams <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> this feat in the same match at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
5|$|With his {{performance}} against Indiana, Robinson {{became the first}} player in Division I FBS history to have two regular season games with 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing. Seven others <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> the feat (including Pat White, Vince Young and Antwaan Randle El), but none have done so {{more than once in}} the regular season. Vince Young accomplished this feat once in the regular season and once in the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|In April, the General Assembly {{called a}} border states {{convention}} {{to be held}} in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and Southern Rightists, but war broke out before the election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the election, and the Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could <b>have</b> <b>accomplished,</b> only nine of Kentucky's twelve delegates were present, along with four from Missouri (out of seven elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, {{the final}} season of his career, Baggio {{recorded}} 12 goals and 11 assists. He scored his 200th goal in Serie A in a 2–2 draw against Parma on 14 March 2004, saving Brescia from relegation, as they finished {{the season in}} 11th place. Baggio was the first player in almost 30 years to surpass the 200-goal milestone, and is currently only one of seven players to <b>have</b> <b>accomplished</b> the feat. Baggio scored his final and 205th Serie A career goal on the second last matchday, in a 2–1 home win over Coppa Italia winners Lazio on 9 May 2004; he also set up Brescia's first goal in that match. He played his last career match on 16 May 2004 on the final matchday of the season at the San Siro against Milan, a 4–2 loss to the Serie A champions; he set-up Matuzalém's goal. In the 88th minute, De Biasi substituted Baggio, prompting the 80,000 present at the San Siro {{to give him a}} standing ovation; Milan defender Paolo Maldini also embraced him before he left the pitch.|$|E
