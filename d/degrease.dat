40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>degreasing,</b> a surface {{preparation}} methods in adhesive bonding, on adhesive joint strength. 5 types of <b>degreasing</b> agents {{were used in the}} study: acetone, extraction naphtha, Ultramyt, Wiko and Loctite 7061. The <b>degreasing</b> operation was performed by three methods: rubbing, spraying and immersion. Strength tests were performed on single-lap adhesive joints of hot-dip galvanized metal sheets made with Loctite 9466 adhesive according to the above variants of surface preparation. The experimental results demonstrate that adhesive joint strength is significantly affected by the applied <b>degreasing</b> agent. Moreover, the method of application of the <b>degreasing</b> agent is crucial, too. The results of strength testing reveal that the most effective <b>degreasing</b> method for hot-dip galvanized metal sheet adhesive joints is spraying using extraction naphtha. Thereby <b>degreased</b> samples have the highest immediate strength and shear strength. The use of extraction naph-tha is also effective in combination with <b>degreasing</b> by rubbing; however, it is not effective when used in combi-nation with immersion, as reflected in the lowest strength results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the metal}} {{finishing}} or aeronautical industries, efficient <b>degreasing</b> of metallic alloy surfaces {{is an essential}} step. This step was first performed with halogenated solvents. Legislation has involved since 1999 their replacement with green cleaners due to the hazardous effects of solvents on human health and on environment.

50|$|The Nebraska Ordnance Plant, {{located near}} Mead, Nebraska was a {{military}} facility that produced bombs, rockets, and shells from 1942-1956. For their production, highly explosive materials like 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were used; to reduce the plant's workers' chemical exposure to these materials, RDX and TNT residues that collected on the floor were washed away with water routinely. The water flowed outside into unlined ditches contaminated the soil around the plant with RDX and TNT. Trichloroethylene (TCE) to <b>degrease</b> pipelines further contaminated the area.

50|$|Since {{the late}} 60's, many methods of parts {{cleaning}} {{have been developed}} with improved levels of safety and lessened environmental impact. Stoddard solvent, gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene were commonly used to clean and <b>degrease</b> parts. Then, chlorinated solvents in vapor degreasers became an industry standard. During the 1980s environmental and safety issues led to the banning of chlorinated solvents for parts cleaning. Aqueous-based cleaning systems took on new prominence that led to many improvements, in the systems and the processes. In 1971, Gary Minkin developed an aqueous based parts washer for degreasing automobile parts. The Minkin breakthrough used the force of hydraulic impact pressure to significantly improve the cleaning power of the aqueous parts washer.|$|E

50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to <b>degrease</b> and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese phosphate coating is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|E
