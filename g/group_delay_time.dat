The GDTA consists of a variable capacitor and a variable equivalent inductor. These components are controlled by two bias voltages separately.

30|$|The <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> {{of surface}} waves at each period was {{estimated}} using the multiple filter analysis technique. We applied group velocity tomography to the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> data. The estimated group velocity {{for longer periods}} of 5 – 8  s exhibited significant spatial variation within the basin that was roughly consistent with the bedrock depth distribution. The group velocity for shorter periods of 2 – 3  s was almost constant over the studied area. A comparison of the estimated dispersion curve and the theoretical dispersion curve calculated from the present velocity structure model would help to identify areas in which further improvement in the model is necessary.|$|E

40|$|When {{applying}} the ray tracing in ionospheric propagation, the electron density modelling {{is the main}} input of the algorithm, since phase refractive index strongly depends on it. Also the magnetic field and frequency collision modelling have their importance, the former as responsible for the azimuth angle deviation of the vertical plane containing the radio wave, the latter {{for the evaluation of}} the absorption of the wave. Anyway, the electron density distribution is strongly dominant when one wants to evaluate the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> characterizing the ionospheric propagation. From the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> azimuth and elevation angles it is possible to determine the point of arrival of the radio wave when it reaches the Earth surface. Moreover, the procedure to establish the target (T) position is one of the essential steps in the Over The Horizon Radar (OTHR) techniques which require the correct knowledge of the electron density distribution. The <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> generally gives rough information of the ground range, which depends on the exact path of the radio wave in the ionosphere. This paper focuses on the lead role that is played by the variation of the electron density grid into the ray tracing algorithm, which is correlated to the change of the electron content along the ionospheric ray path, for obtaining a ray tracing as much reliable as possible. In many cases of practical interest, the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> depends on the geometric length and the electron content of the ray path. The issue is faced theoretically, and a simple analytical relation, between the variation of the electron content along the path and the difference in time between the group delays, calculated and measured, both in the ionosphere and in the vacuum, is obtained and discussed. An example of how an oblique radio link can be improved by varying the electron density grid is also shown and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{reflection}} and transmission <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> are systematically investigated in an asymmetric single quantum barrier. It is {{reported that the}} reflection times in both evanescent and propagating cases can be either negative or positive, depending on the relative height of the potential energies on {{the two sides of}} the barrier. In the evanescent case where the energy of incident particles is less than the height of the barrier, the {{reflection and}} transmission times in the opaque limit are both independent of the barrier&# 39;s thickness, showing superluminality. On the other hand, in the propagating case where the energy of incident particles is larger than the height of the barrier, the reflection and transmission times as the periodical function of the barrier&# 39;s thickness can be greatly enhanced by the transmission resonance. It is also shown that the transmission time and the reflection times for the two propagation directions in the same asymmetric configuration satisfy the reciprocal relation, as consequence of time reversal invariance in quantum mechanics. These phenomena may lead to novel applications in electronic devices...|$|R

The effects of DTZ and other calcium channel blockers on memory have been discussed with several procedures and different theories have been suggested. In the present study, the effect of DTZ on retention and retrieval of memory in young and aged mice was investigated by using the passive avoidance apparatus. For this purpose, after weighting, coding and classifying the mice, they were grouped as follow: test group received electric shock plus DTZ (10 and 30 mg kg - 1, i. p.), blank group received electric shock plus normal saline and control group received only electric shock.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the slow-light effect in the {{microfiber}} based resonator, a microfiber double-knot resonator with a parallel structure was designed and fabricated. Based on the theories of the ring resonator and the direction coupler, the theoretical model of the microfiber double-knot resonator with a parallel structure was proposed, {{the direction of the}} light-field propagation and coupling in the resonator was analyzed, the mathematic expression between the output light and the input one in the resonator was deduced, and the expression of the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was also obtained. By numerical simulating method, the spectra of the transmission and the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> were given, the corresponding relationship between group delays and resonant wavelengths of the transmission spectrum in the resonator was analyzed. The numerical result indicates that a large group delay can be obtained at the resonant wavelength with a large extinction ratio in the resonator. In experimental, a microfiber double-knot resonator with a parallel structure was fabricated, the transmission spectrum of the fabricated resonator was well consistent with the theoretical simulation, indicating that the theoretical analysis is correct. Employing the pulse-delay method in the Oscilloscope, a measuring system of the slow-light delay in the resonator was set up. A group delay of about 75 ps in the fabricated resonator is achieved, which is larger than the reported value.

On a data set of music with less percussive content, the beat tracking accuracy achieved by the system is improved by 82 % when the suggested phase-based onset detection approach is used instead of the amplitudebased approach, while on a set of music with stronger percussive characteristics both onset detection approaches provide comparable results of accuracy. ...|$|R
