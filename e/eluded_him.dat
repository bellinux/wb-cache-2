5|$|During his {{lifetime}} Bruce received many awards: the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1904; the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1910; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913, and the Livingstone Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1920. He also received an honorary LLD {{degree from the}} University of Aberdeen. The honour that <b>eluded</b> <b>him,</b> however, was the Polar Medal, awarded by the Sovereign {{on the recommendation of}} the Royal Geographical Society. Although the Medal was awarded to the members of every other British or Commonwealth Antarctic expedition during the early 20th century, the SNAE was the exception; the medal was withheld.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1934, McCabe scored 2,078 runs at 69.28 {{including}} eight centuries on the tour, {{more than}} any of his teammates. In the second match of the tour against Leicestershire, McCabe scored the century that had <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> four years earlier, finishing 108 not out. He then scored 192 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, combining with Ponsford in a record partnership for the third wicket of 389, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests; the MCC fielded almost a full-strength England team. McCabe put in an all round performance against Hampshire, scoring 79 and taking 4/79 in the first innings. In the next match, he scored 240, the highest of his career, against Surrey at The Oval. In the next match, the last fixture before the Tests, McCabe made 142 against Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|While {{generally}} {{successful with}} his race horses, Zayat's goal {{of winning the}} Kentucky Derby <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> several times, including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|The war {{continued}} {{through the rest of}} 1675 and into the next year. The English were constantly frustrated by the Native Americans' refusal to meet them in pitched battle. They employed a form of guerilla warfare that confounded the English. Captain Benjamin Church continuously campaigned to enlist the help of friendly Native Americans to help learn how to fight on an even footing with Philip's warrior bands, but he was constantly rebuffed by the Plymouth leadership who mistrusted all Native Americans, thinking them potential enemies. Eventually, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military commander Major William Bradford (son of the late Governor William Bradford) relented and gave Church permission to organize a combined force of English and Native Americans. After securing the alliance of the Sakonnet, he led his combined force in pursuit of Philip, who had thus far avoided any major battles in the war that bears his name. Throughout July 1676, Church's band captured hundreds of Native American warriors, often without much of a fight, though Philip <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> Church was given permission to grant amnesty to any captured Native Americans who would agree to join the English side, and his force grew immensely. Philip was killed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war soon ended as an overwhelming English victory.|$|E
5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself {{on the other side of}} a close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.|$|E

5|$|The club {{failed to}} achieve further league or cup success until the {{appointment}} of former Everton player Howard Kendall in 1981. Kendall initially proved unpopular with the Goodison Park crowd, {{but this was not}} to last as he led Everton to their most successful season ever winning the European Cup Winners' Cup and the First Division in the 198485 season. Following success in the Charity Shield twice and another League championship in 198687, Kendall resigned from Everton to manage Spanish side Athletic Bilbao. He returned for two further spells during the 1990s (1990-1993 & 1997-1998) but without such success. Former Everton player and Oldham Athletic manager Joe Royle was appointed in 1994 following the disastrous reign of Mike Walker (1994 for 10 months) winning the FA Cup in the same season. Injury crises and players such as Andrei Kanchelskis being sold led to Royle's resignation in March 1997. Former Rangers manager, Walter Smith, took the position in August 1998, but he failed to transfer the success he had achieved in Scotland. With three bottom-half finishes in his first three seasons, and facing relegation in the 200102 season, Smith was sacked. He was replaced by fellow Scot David Moyes who led the club back into European football, finishing fifth in the 200607 season. Under Moyes's 11-year managership, the club prospered, qualifying for the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the FA Cup final in 2009. However, the long-awaited trophy that his leadership deserved <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> Having stalled on contract renewal discussions, and following the announcement of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement as manager of Manchester United {{at the end of the}} 2013 season, Moyes succeeded him at Old Trafford.|$|E
25|$|With {{the money}} he earned, Merrick {{returned}} to France.

25|$|He won his Yorkshire cap in 1986, {{the year}} he was voted the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year, but despite scoring nearly 12,000 {{first-class}} runs, higher honours <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> He scored a half century in his only appearance for England Young Cricketers in 1983.|$|E

25|$|From 1956 to 1962 inclusive, Titmus {{achieved}} the double in every year except 1958, but {{a place in}} the Test team still <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> 1961 was his best year with the bat, as he scored 1,703 runs at a fine average of 37.02, including 14 half-centuries; he passed 50 more than a hundred times {{in the course of his}} first-class career.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} 18 Test matches, Chanderpaul scored 1,232 runs {{at an average}} of 49.28, but despite scoring {{thirteen}} half-centuries, his highest score was 82; a Test century <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> He reached the milestone in his nineteenth Test, scoring 137 against India. Just over a month later, he repeated the feat in One Day International cricket, striking his maiden century in the format, scoring 109 runs, also against India.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{influence}} {{on the development of}} his game was former India captain Bishan Bedi, coach of Jammu and Kashmir between 2011 and 2014. With Bedi's guidance helping him overhaul his mental approach to batting, Dev Singh scored 406 runs at 67.66 in first-class matches in 2011-12, and earned selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy. For his part, Bedi described Dev Singh as 'a very good shorter version batsman and a brilliant fielder' who was 'definitely ready for a break', either {{in the form of an}} international call-up or an IPL contract. As of 2017, however, such honours have <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1966 he {{returned}} to Porsche for a comeback in the World Sportscar Championship, as Porsche started a serious effort there. Following several podium finishes with the still underpowered two liter Porsche 906 and later models, he won the 1968 24 Hours of Daytona in a 907 {{as well as the}} Sebring 12 Hours again, now together with Swiss Jo Siffert. The overall win of the 1000km Nürburgring always <b>eluded</b> <b>him,</b> even though Herrmann had taken part in each of these races at the Nürburgring since they were introduced in 1953, and had finished second three times in a row from 1968 to 1970, behind teammates Jo Siffert and/or Vic Elford.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, Woods was {{the only}} player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the {{calendar}} Grand Slam, which had <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> in 2000. All eyes were on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes {{in the final round}} cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.|$|E
25|$|India {{needed to}} cross 400 {{runs in the}} second innings just to make Australia bat again, which they had not scored even once in the entire series. But VVS Laxman seemed to have found the form that had <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> the entire series. The {{complete}} range of cricket strokes was on display as Laxman flew to 167 in just 198 balls, being particularly savage on Brett Lee (taking 52 runs off 5 overs at one point) and Shane Warne. The rest of the Indian batting, however, could not {{stand up to the}} accuracy of Glen McGrath as he took five wickets to go with the fifer in the first innings. He was declared Man of the Match, as Australia won comprehensively by an innings and 141 runs.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{winning the}} company's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament in 2004, {{championship}} gold <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b> In 2005, Danielson {{announced in the}} company's newsletter, the ROH Newswire, that he had quit ROH after being frustrated by his inability to defeat Austin Aries for the ROH World Championship. It was later revealed Danielson had become frustrated in general with professional wrestling and planned {{to take some time}} off to evaluate his career options. Danielson had several dates booked in Europe and Japan, however, leading fans to believe that the periodical was likely a storyline claim for Danielson's absence during this period. In May 2005, rumors started that Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) was interested in signing Danielson, and he also had some more tryout matches with WWE at that time, but none of these events led to anything and he remained in ROH.|$|E
25|$|Moving up from Formula Two, Fittipaldi {{made his}} race debut for Team Lotus {{as a third}} driver at the 1970 British Grand Prix. After Jochen Rindt was killed at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, the Brazilian became Lotus's lead driver in only his fifth Grand Prix. He enjoyed {{considerable}} success with Lotus, winning the World Drivers' Championship in 1972 {{at the age of}} 25, a youngest F1 world champion record that he held for 33 years. He later moved to McLaren for 1974, winning the title once again. He surprised the paddock by moving to his brother's Fittipaldi Automotive team prior to the 1976 season, being replaced by James Hunt. Success <b>eluded</b> <b>him</b> during his final years in Formula One, with the Fittipaldi cars not competitive enough to fight for victories. Fittipaldi took two more podium finishes, before retiring in 1980.|$|E
25|$|At its {{formation}} in 1889 United did not employ what would today be termed a manager, the side was coached by a trainer and a football committee selected {{the team and}} decided upon tactics (this was {{a continuation of the}} structure of Sheffield United Cricket Club from which the football team had been formed.) They did appoint Joseph Wostinholm to the position of club secretary and he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, matchday organisation and dealing with players and contracts. Wostinholm oversaw a period of rapid growth for the team, culminating in 1899 when United won their one and only First Division championship, after which he retired. Wostinholm was replaced by John Nicholson as secretary and he would remain in post for over 30 years until his death in 1932. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in the club's history as United became a leading force in English football, winning the FA Cup four times and regularly challenged {{at the top of the}} league but a second Division One title for the club <b>eluded</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
