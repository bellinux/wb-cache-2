5|$|In {{preparation}} of the storm, a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands. Officials urged residents {{to stock up on}} supplies and they closed beaches. Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will likely be upgraded into a hurricane warning, this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> storm to pass south of the island chain.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference {{meant that}} the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Some media were <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> Penguins to win the series for three reasons—the Penguins had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff {{troubles}} and the strong young talent of the Penguins, particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3–0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company—under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke—moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements. Under-strength and not <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> feature to be occupied, instead the Australians found {{a large number of}} Chinese in well {{prepared}} defensive positions. Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and bayonets, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw. Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the Chinese to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. Chinese casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the Military Cross.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5|$|H.D. married Aldington in 1913; however, {{their first}} and only child, a daughter, was {{stillborn}} in 1915. Aldington enlisted in the army. The couple became estranged, and Aldington reportedly took a mistress in 1917. H.D. became involved in a close but platonic relationship with D. H. Lawrence. In 1916, her first book, Sea Garden, was published, and she was appointed assistant editor of The Egoist, replacing her husband. In 1918, her brother Gilbert was killed in action, and that March she moved into a cottage in Cornwall with the composer Cecil Gray, a friend of Lawrence. She became pregnant with Gray's child; however, {{by the time she}} realised she was <b>expecting,</b> <b>the</b> relationship had cooled and Gray had returned to live in London.

5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street substation and neighborhood lines laid in the early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street substation through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s.|$|E

Governor George Ryan called the Illinois Legislature to a special session to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills, a pet issue of Rush, which had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Obama supported the package, but the session dragged on towards Christmas. Obama annually spent the Christmas vacation in Hawaii with his family visiting his grandmother, who raised him. Obama left Illinois, <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> session would continue into January. However, a crucial vote took place earlier than expected, failing by five votes with Obama and others absent.

5|$|President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{days after}} the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <b>Expecting</b> <b>the</b> Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) {{as a form of}} resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him impervious to bullets.|$|E

40|$|By {{using data}} from surveys of expectations, it is shown that {{macroeconomic}} uncertainty, measured by the standard deviation of <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> output growth, <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> unemployment rate, and <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> inflation rate, is negatively related to <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> performance of <b>the</b> economy, proxied by <b>the</b> <b>expected</b> growth rate of output.

5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer pyramid allows it to be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, <b>expecting</b> <b>the</b> layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
