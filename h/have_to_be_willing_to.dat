As a young man he was also recognized for his athletic prowess in both high school and college, being named an All-American as a lineman in college football. Olds expressed his philosophy regarding fighter pilots in the quote: [...] "There are pilots and there are pilots; with the good ones, it is inborn. You can't teach it.

2500|$|An {{information}} technology specialist named Mimi, based in Toronto, Canada, helped {{to lead the}} protest movement {{in the wake of}} the departures of Norris and Wellington. Mimi stated to AOL News that the protest movement should be regarded as, [...] "pro-free speech, not anti-Muslim." [...] She commented, [...] "If [...] are offended, they have the right to be offended – just like Christians." [...] With regard to keeping with the tenets of Freedom of Speech, Mimi is permitting a wide array of depictions of Muhammad [...] "except for those inciting violence or pornographic in nature." [...] "Mainstream society does whatever the Muslim society asks out of fear of violence or political correctness. But if you want to live in a Western society and use the system to protect your rights, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow others to have theirs as well," [...] said Mimi.|$|E

He tells him that if he wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a leader, he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> get [...] "blood on your hands". After a dispatcher informs Holder that Jamie's campaign vehicle was found at City Hall, he, Linden, and Gwen arrive at the campaign office. Jamie commits suicide by cop when he points the gun at Linden, and Holder then shoots him dead. Later, a cop informs them that the gun was not loaded.|$|R
500|$|... "Stark Raving Dad" [...] was {{the final}} episode in the season two {{production}} run, but aired as the premiere of season three, over a year after it was completed. Michael Jackson was credited with pseudonym John Jay Smith in the closing credits. At the time, the producers of the show were legally prevented from confirming that Jackson guest starred, although many media sources assumed it was really him. Similarly, in season two, actor Dustin Hoffman had guest starred in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute" [...] under the name [...] "Sam Etic". After [...] "Stark Raving Dad", the producers decided that if a celebrity wished to guest star on the show, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> credited under their real name.|$|R

5000|$|Clifton's task, then, is to {{describe}} musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called [...] "phenomena," [...] and the activity of describing phenomena is called [...] "phenomenology" [...] It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings[...] [...] [...] To talk about such experience {{in a meaningful way}} demands several things. First, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance[...] [...] [...] Second, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials[...] [...] [...] Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful.|$|E

50|$|Blackwell {{arranged}} for Zakrzewska’s {{entry into the}} Western Reserve University’s medical program that was unique in accepting female students. With her acceptance, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> learn sufficient English. As she <b>was</b> planning <b>to</b> move out west to attend the program, she ran into further obstacles. She {{was one of only}} four women out of two hundred students attending the medical school. No one wanted to share an apartment with a female doctor, so Blackwell {{arranged for}} temporary housing at the home of Caroline Severance. The men on campus welcomed her with disgust and hostility. They petitioned the institution to refuse to enroll the women after the winter term. Despite the bumpy road, she obtained her medical degree in March 1856 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|R
30|$|Participating {{patients}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{at least}} 18  years old with {{a diagnosis of}} ESBC starting a new myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen and anticipated to receive at least four cycles. There was no upper age limit for participation and no restrictions based on the comorbid conditions or performance status. The patients <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> return for scheduled nadir visits and to sign informed consent. In order to lessen the chance of selection bias, sites <b>were</b> required <b>to</b> enroll consecutive eligible patients and maintain a log of all patients who were offered participation in the study. Lactating females, patients treated with continuous chemotherapy, with active infection, receiving concurrent cytotoxic therapy for non-cancer condition, or participating in a double blind clinical trial were excluded. The analysis presented here is based on patients with available toxicity data {{for at least the}} first cycle of chemotherapy.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, {{according}} to co-producer Friendly, Murrow and Paley had a heated exchange in Paley's office; Paley {{said he was}} tired of getting [...] "stomach aches" [...] every time See It Now covered controversial matter; Murrow replied, [...] "That's a price you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay".

500|$|Many guest stars {{come into}} the show's {{recording}} studio to record their parts, although some are recorded over the telephone. Two guest stars have been credited with writing the episode in which they guest starred. Comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode [...] "Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife", while actor Seth Rogen co-wrote the episode [...] "Homer the Whopper" [...] with Evan Goldberg. Two guest stars were credited with pseudonyms. Actor Dustin Hoffman was credited as [...] "Sam Etic" [...] for the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute" [...] while musician Michael Jackson was credited as [...] "John Jay Smith" [...] for the episode [...] "Stark Raving Dad". After the latter episode, the producers decided that if a celebrity wished to guest star on the show, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> credited under their real name.|$|R
2500|$|As to [...] "preconceived intent", at {{the time}} of the {{investigation}} and prosecution, federal court appellate cases and the INS regulations permitted [...] "dual intent", a desire to stay, but a willingness to comply with the law if denied permanent residence. Further, the relevant intent is that of the employer, not the employee. Given the public nature of Rajneesh's arrival and stay, and the aggressive scrutiny by the INS, Rajneesh would appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> leave the US if denied benefits. The government nonetheless prosecuted him based on preconceived intent. As to arranging a marriage, the government only claimed that Rajneesh told someone who lived in his house that they should get married in order to stay. Such encouragement appears to constitute incitement, nor a crime in the US, but not a conspiracy, which requires the formation of a plan and acts in furtherance.|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} our garden {{to grow and}} thrive, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} our styles, our cultures and our knowledge musically. In the late 60’s and early 70’s integration was designed to give students of socio-economically disadvantaged groups {{the opportunity for a}} “better” education. Educators discovered that when students from every race, every economic background with a variety of exposure, of talent and skills came together and gleaned from one another these schools became breeding grounds for great successes. Some of the most novel ideas, greatest collaborations and partnerships came from this concept, the concept of “integration”.|$|E
30|$|When you {{intuitively}} {{and positively}} know something {{is the right}} thing to do, proceed, and then later, if necessary, ask for forgiveness. There is a gray area between ignoring agency policies and regulations to get the job done efficiently (or in some cases at all) and getting a reprimand in your file. If I thought the situation at hand was important, I generally went for it, and thus developed an interesting personnel file over my career. Upper management typically liked the results because they made them look good, but if my immediate supervisor was a ‘by the book’ person, or was looking for an opportunity for revenge, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> face the consequences. Don’t ever lie to try to extricate yourself from a situation, you will likely find yourself in a heap more trouble and you will have just ruined your reputation and lost your self-respect.|$|R
2500|$|Künneth {{understood}} that the dogmatic theologian, [...] "of all people", <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make his views on the Resurrection event precisely and definitively known (p95). For him, the empty tomb was a sign, interpreted by the ophthe to the apostles. The empty tomb expresses Resurrection's [...] "face towards history" [...] (p97), proof that its power touches the vale of tears of matter undergoing history. Yet, God's power <b>is</b> not bound <b>to</b> or by the substratum of Creation. The Resurrection touches history, and lives within it, but is not conditioned by it. In this, he concurs with Bultmann, although he disagrees with Emil Brunner that one cannot make dogmatic, plausible, and adequate statements {{about what happened in}} the Resurrection Ur-Wunder. [...] "It will no longer do to speak vaguely and obscurely about it, as Albert Scweitzer rightly accuses theology of doing" [...] (p95).|$|R

50|$|All {{children}} and young people from 6 years are welcome in FOS. Race, social origin, nationality, sexual orientation, physical or cultural differences is never a basis for refusal. Also are people with any philosophical, religious or political conviction welcome as long as these principles are compatible with the vision of Open Scouting. FOS believes that a conviction is never finished, that you have to accept that a different view can and may have consequences and that you basically always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> review your vision and possibly amend it. FOS encourages a respectful dialogue about the various forms of spirituality in society. This confrontation of ideas is believed to enrich the spiritual choices of the members.|$|E
