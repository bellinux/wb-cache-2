50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), <b>drain</b> <b>valves,</b> block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving.

Since Faslane was a nuclear {{submarine}} base, Chicoutimi {{was forced to}} travel on the surface for {{the first stage of}} the passage. On 5 October Chicoutimi was passing through a gale with 6 m seas. During a watch change at 0300 sea water entered the conning tower. The lower hatch prevented the water from entering the sub; however, the drain in the tower failed to operate. When the lower hatch was opened, the water fell into the sub. However, the water was pumped overboard and the incident noted. The <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> required repair before diving. At 1052 two crew entered the tower to perform repairs. The upper hatch was opened. However, after roughly 25 minutes, another tool was needed from within the sub. When the lower hatch was opened, the submarine was rocked by a large wave, throwing roughly 500 gallons of sea water into Chicoutimi. Electrical explosions and fire erupted soon afterward, spreading quickly. In order to fight the fire, all systems aboard the submarine were shut down, leaving the submarine dead in the water. An attempt to restore auxiliary power caused another fire to break out. At 1912, attempts to remove smoke by starting an oxygen generator caused another fire. Nine sailors were injured, three seriously.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-AÃ©rospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|E

40|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> {{located in}} the bottom of the K-West Basin South Loadout Pit (SLOP) could provide an {{additional}} leak path from the K Basins if the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> were damaged during construction, installation, or operation of the cask loading system. For the K-West Basin SLOP the immersion pail support structure (IPSS) has already been installed, but the immersion pail has not been installed in the IPSS. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the risk of damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> during the remaining installation activities or operation of the cask loading system. Valve damage, as used in this analysis, does not necessarily imply large amounts of the water will be released quickly from the basin, rather valve damage implies that the valve's integrity has been compromised. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where best engineering judgement is used to represent each variable in the analysis. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution. The uncertainty is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and the risk is expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve''). The total risk is the area under the ''risk curve''. The risk of potentially dropping a cask into or on the IPSS and damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> is approximately 1 x 10 {sup - 4 } to 2 x 10 {sup - 5 } per year. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve is 3 x 10 {sup - 2 } to 6 x 10 {sup - 3 } per year. Both risks are expressed as drain value failure frequencies. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve can be significantly reduced by an impact limiter and/or installing a gating or plate over the area bounded by the back of the IPSS and the wall of the SLOP.

40|$|Internal {{leakages}} of {{high pressure}} and temperature steam valves {{have been identified}} as a potential contributor to a loss in power generating plant efficiency. These losses are often neglected due to it being difficult to detect problematic valves and quantify the internal leakages through them. A non-intrusive NOT technique that detects and quantifies internal leakages through valves will be a very favourable tool to any power generating plant as it will allow for the early detection of internal leakages and could possibly provide considerable financial savings. This research evaluates different monitoring techniques suitable for detecting and quantifying internal leakages through valves and selects a technique that is most suitable for application in a power generating plant environment. The proposed technique utilises infra-red thermography to calculate pipe surface temperatures on a length of un-insulated pipe located downstream of a valve that is leaking internally. As the leakage steam flows through the length of un-insulated pipe, it will lose a portion of its heat energy through the pipe wall to the surrounding environment. This will result in a drop in temperature of the steam from the upstream to downstream points of the un-insulated length of pipe. By calculating the heat loss and the drop in temperature of the leakage steam, a mass flow rate of the leakage steam can be determined. A mathematical model was derived which with inputs of upstream and downstream pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe, pipe properties and ambient air conditions, calculates the heat loss, the temperature drop and the resulting mass flow rate of the leakage flow through the valve. A detailed experimental study was conducted to validate the proposed technique in determining internal leakages thought steam valves. Steam generated from a mini steam generating plant was allowed to flow through an experimental test rig, which contained a length of un-insulated pipe, at different flow rates. Pipe surface temperature measurements of the un-insulated pipe were made using an infrared thermal camera and a mass flow rate of the steam was calculated using the derived mathematical model. In all experiments, the mass flow rate calculated using the mathematical model was compared to a mass flow rate acquired from a flow measuring device installed in-line with the experimental test rig. The results indicate that an increase in mass flow rate causes an increase in pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe which translates to an increase in heat loss of the leakage steam through the length of un-insulated pipe. The mass flow rate calculated using the proposed technique closely approximates the mass flow rate acquired from the flow measuring device. This indicates that the proposed technique, using infrared thermography, is capable of detecting and quantifying possible internal valve leakages encountered in online operation. Onsite tests were performed using the proposed technique on two different boiler <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> at Majuba Power Station. It was found that one of the valves was internally leaking steam to the atmosphere at a rate of 0. 039 kg/s whilst the other valve was sealing correctly. A comprehensive financial impact study was conducted, and it was found that this leakage steam will result in a total loss of R 730 108 per annum if the leak is left unattended. This is the loss for a single valve that has a relatively small leak. The financial loss for a combination of all valves that are internally leaking in a power plant could be substantial and can clearly justify plant personnel in utilising the proposed technique to identify problematic valves. With its portability, non-intrusiveness and ease of use the proposed technique provides a cost-effective means to determine internal leakages through power plant valves...|$|E
