5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, where no one was seriously injured because the fire was self-contained.|$|E

40|$|How <b>are</b> {{reasons and}} <b>evidence</b> interrelated? According to one {{prevalent}} view, reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> equivalent: <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> a reason, and a reason <b>is</b> <b>evidence.</b> On another view reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conditionally related: if there <b>is</b> <b>evidence,</b> then there <b>is</b> a reason. On {{a different view}} reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> disjunctively related: reasons or <b>evidence</b> can <b>be</b> substituted for each other. In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conjunctively related: <b>evidence</b> and reasons <b>are</b> distinguishable yet inseparable. I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> distinct because they come apart in certain cases, and I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> inseparable because only when properly conjoined are they capable of yielding correct verdicts on important cases in epistemology...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|New {{settlements}} appearing {{along the}} rivers Mureş, Someş, and Târnava reflects {{a period of}} tranquility in Gepidia until around 568. The common people in Biharia, Cenad, Moreşti, and other villages lived in sunken huts covered with gabled roofs but with no hearths or ovens. They were primarily farmers, but looms, combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by finds of amber beads and brooches manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of artefacts and inscriptions relating to Menkauhor's reign, few of his activities are known. Menkauhor sent an expedition to Sinai to exploit the mines of turquoise and copper in the Wadi Maghareh. The expedition <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by a damaged rock inscription showing Menkauhor's titulary {{which is one of}} the few attestations dating to his lifetime. The mines of Sinai had been exploited since the Third Dynasty (2686 BC–2613 BC), and both Menkauhor's predecessor Nyuserre Ini and successor Djedkare Isesi sent expeditions to the Wadi Maghareh.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{from the earliest}} periods of human activity, as <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by occasional finds of Mesolithic flint artefacts and by palaeoenvironmental evidence from caves in Dovedale and elsewhere. There is also evidence of Neolithic activity, including some monumental earthworks or barrows (burial mounds) such as that at Margery Hill. In the Bronze Age the area was well populated and farmed, and evidence of these people survives in henges such as Arbor Low near Youlgreave, or the Nine Ladies Stone Circle at Stanton Moor.|$|E

This interaction takes place in the 3'UTR, where binding of GAPDH prevents the translation of the mRNA sequence.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe glucose {{metabolism}} of Fibrobacter succinogenes S 85 was studied in detail; key intermediates and alternative pathways <b>were</b> <b>evidenced</b> by NMR and/or enzymatic assays. A high phosphoketolase activity was detected in four strains of Fibrobacter under strictly anaerobic conditions, with ribose- 5 -phosphate as substrate, no activity <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> with fructose- 6 -phosphate. This {{is the first}} report of a pentose phosphates phosphoketolase in bacteria unable to use pentoses. In contrast, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway could not <b>be</b> <b>evidenced.</b> Incubation of living cells of F. succinogenes with Na 213 CO 3 confirmed the incorporation of 13 CO 2 in the carboxylic group of succinate. The presence of fumarase <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> by in vivo 13 C-NMR using 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO); the enzyme showed a high reversibility under physiological conditions. The production of formate from glucose catabolism <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> by enzymatic assay and by NMR and a pyruvate formate lyase activity was detected using strictly anaerobic conditions...|$|R

5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the ash <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular quartz grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive lithology in the sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|After the Central African Republic {{attained}} {{independence in}} 1960, developmental activities began, and the urbanization of Bangui ensued. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the population growth from 279,800 in 1975 to 427,435 in 1988 to 524,000 by 1994. and to 652,000 in 2001. Apart from the ethnic {{people of the}} country, the city is also home for a minority group of Greek, Portuguese and Yemeni traders, and also has a small community of French people. The Bangui resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, and refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|During the Terminal Classic, El Chal {{maintained}} its primary {{place in the}} San Juan valley. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late Classic monuments. The continued importance of El Chal in the Terminal Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo {{to the west and}} Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During the Terminal Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.|$|E
5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler {{had the power to}} void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost {{to the time of}} the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|The architects in the Karnataka region seem to {{have been}} {{inspired}} by architectural developments in northern India. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> {{by the fact that they}} incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.|$|E
5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Worlebury Camp (also {{known as}} Worlebury Hillfort) {{is the site}} of an Iron Age hillfort on Worlebury Hill, north of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. The fort was {{designed}} for defence, as <b>is</b> <b>evidenced</b> by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down on the hillside. Nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into the bedrock, and many of these had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.|$|E
