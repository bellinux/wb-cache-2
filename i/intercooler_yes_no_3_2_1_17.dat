40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} effects of implementation intentions on taking one multivitamin tablet, everyday, for 2 weeks, among individuals who endorsed self-concordant and self-discordant forms of motivation. A 2 (implementation intentions: <b>yes,</b> <b>no)</b> × <b>3</b> (motivation: self-concordance, self-discordance, control) experimental design was adopted with university students being exposed to manipulations of implementation intentions, self-concordance, and self-discordance (male = 110, female = 120, M age = 23. 50 years, SD = 7. 21). Results of the study indicated that while implementation intentions increased multivitamin intake for individuals who endorsed self-concordant and self-discordant forms of motivation, the combination of self-concordance and implementation intentions produced particularly enhanced levels of compliance on multivitamin intake. The implications of results of the present study to theory development and practice are discussed. © 2010 The British Psychological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Check out the survey by Arora, Hazan and Kale [AHK 05]; our discussion {{will be based on}} their treatment. Due to its broad appeal, we will consider multiplicative weights in more generality than we need for solving LPs and SDPs. In this lecture, we’ll introduce some strategies for playing a prediction game. We’ll tweak the game to suit our optimization needs. Finally, we’ll play the tweaked game with a strategy called Hedge. 16. 1 Warmup: prediction with expert advice The following sequential game is played between an omniscient Adversary and an Aggregator who is advised by N experts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Monitoring worker {{health and}} {{evaluating}} occupational healthcare interventions requires sensitive instruments that are reliable over time. The Need for Recovery scale (NFR), which quantifies workers' difficulties in recovering from work related exertions, {{may be a}} relevant instrument in this respect. OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the NFR's test-retest reliability and (2) the NFR's sensitivity to detect {{the effect of a}} fatigue inducing change, namely an increase in working hours. METHODS: Two year longitudinal data of 526 truck drivers and 144 nurses were used. Two week, one year, and two year test-retest reliability was examined in both stable and unstable work environments by calculating intraclass correlations (ICCs). Work environmental (in) stability was quantified by four events that might have occurred during the follow up period: (1) a reorganisation or merge (0 = <b>yes,</b> 1 = <b>no),</b> (2) a change of supervisor or management (0 = <b>yes,</b> 1 = <b>no),</b> (<b>3)</b> a change in working hours or work schedules (0 = <b>yes,</b> 1 = <b>no),</b> and (4) a change in work activities, position, or duties (0 = <b>yes,</b> 1 = <b>no).</b> The four scores constituted a work (in) stability index ranging from 0 to 4. The NFR's sensitivity to detect the effect of the increase in working hours was assessed indirectly by comparing it with an alternative scale, namely the Checklist Individual Strength. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability over a two year interval was good to excellent when applied in stable work environments (ICCs 0. 68 to 0. 80) but, as expected, poor to fair when applied in unstable work environments (ICCs 0. 30 to 0. 55). The NFR was sensitive in detecting an increase in work related fatigue due to the increase in working hours (effect size 0. 40). CONCLUSIONS: The NFR's test-retest reliability and sensitivity to detect change are favourable. This implicates that the NFR may form a valuable part of health surveys and may be a useful tool for evaluating occupational healthcare intervention...|$|R

40|$|We analyze what {{functions}} as a YES response and a NO response for different yes/no questions. This problem is surprisingly complex: respondents do not always produce overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> lexical items {{in response to a}} yes/no question. In addition, when respondents don't include a clear <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> word, they may mean to communicate a clear <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> meaning, or something else. We find that the classification of yes/no questions described in (Carletta et al., 1995) for the Edinburgh map task corpus correlates well with whether a response will be a bare <b>yes</b> or <b>no,</b> a <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> plus additional speech, or just speech without an overt <b>yes</b> or <b>no.</b> Correlation with responses described simply as as "direct" or "indirect" is less good.
