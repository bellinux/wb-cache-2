5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task though, {{despite the fact that}} several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E

The solitary tinamou has 11 different vocalizations. In most species both sexes call; some have different calls for males and females. Females tend to have deeper voices. Some species, in particular members of Crypturellus, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted tinamous have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{sources of}} the Indo-Greek kingdom are very few, and the separation of kings with the same name <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> process. Numismatician Osmund Bopearachchi identifies three kings named Demetrius, placing the third around 100 BCE due to mintmarks and style of the coins. (See discussion under Demetrius II). R C Senior agrees with this reconstruction, even though their dates are somewhat different: according to Bopearachchi he ruled around 100 BCE, whereas R. C. Senior places him circa 70 BCE, in both cases as successor of Heliokles II.|$|E

25|$|The {{issues of}} such {{resources}} are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States {{signed an agreement}} with ElSalvador in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with Canada, Peru, Guatemala, and Mali and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 UNESCO Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{understanding}} {{is a term}} used commonly in education to define a mode of thinking, described as, ‘an essential tool for participating in democratic processes, at whatever level.’ It is a defensible position reached through the examination of ideas, issues or sources. It is achieved through reflecting upon, analysing and evaluating different ideas and positions, and is demonstrated through an ability to express informed responses and independent thought. Critical understanding develops through analytical and independent thought and is considered an increasingly important element of the education process as students progress to higher and further education. However it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> concept to communicate for {{it is not a}} passive thing we do; it is about active engagement.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task {{determining}} {{whether or not}} a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a bite to a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the novel was {{published}} in the United Kingdom, The Guardian ran an article about French best-sellers published in English, focusing on The Elegance of the Hedgehog.

Promotions buyer Jonathan Ruppin predicted that the novel would struggle to gain a readership in the United Kingdom because, according to him, in the UK market [...] "the plot is what people want more than anything else" [...] and the novel's storyline is not its central aspect.|$|E

500|$|Following an {{incident}} in which Natasha sprays graffiti around Ramsay Street, Michael disowns his daughter and ignores her attempts {{to get back in}} his good books. Natasha finds the situation weird and she is hurt by her father's actions. Novakovic said Natasha is disappointed in herself for hurting Michael so much. Natasha responds by taking advantage of her new independence to try to get Michael's attention. She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside. Of how Natasha feels about this, Novakovic said [...] "She knows how much her father loves her which is why this is even more jarring, as she realises it must be killing her father to act this way." [...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> journey and they have a lot to work through. Novakovic told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline would change Natasha and she would become more sensitive and less self-absorbed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club {{announced}} on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using [...] "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, [...] "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [...] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
500|$|In the 1963–64 NBA season, Chamberlain got {{yet another}} new coach, Alex Hannum, and {{was joined by}} a {{promising}} rookie center, Nate Thurmond, who eventually entered the Hall of Fame. Ex-soldier Hannum, who later entered the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing. Most importantly, he was not afraid {{to stand up to}} the dominant Chamberlain, who was known to [...] "freeze out" [...] (not communicate with) coaches he didn't like. Backed up by valuable rookie Thurmond, Chamberlain had another good season with 36.9 ppg and 22.3 rpg, and the Warriors went all the way to the NBA Finals. In that series they succumbed to Russell's Boston Celtics yet again, this time losing 4–1. But as Cherry remarked, not only Chamberlain, but in particular Hannum deserved much credit because he had basically had taken the bad 31–49 squad of last year plus Thurmond and made it into a NBA Finalist. In the summer of 1964 Chamberlain, one of the prominent participants at the famed Rucker Park basketball court in New York City, made the acquaintance of a tall, talented 17-year-old teenager who played there. Soon, the young Lew Alcindor was allowed into his inner circle, and quickly idolized the ten-year older NBA player. Unfortunately, Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as Alcindor would name himself later, would develop an intensely personal antipathy. In the following 1964–65 NBA season, the Warriors got off to a terrible start and ran into financial trouble. At the 1965 All-Star break Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals. In return the Warriors received Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer (who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors), and $150,000 (equal to about $ today). When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: [...] "Chamberlain <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> man to love [...] the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him. Wilt is easy to hate [...] people came to see him lose." ...|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back}} to school while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
