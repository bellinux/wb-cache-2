25|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when <b>he</b> <b>licked</b> his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift {{up a piece of}} paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{he wrote}} that in 2000, {{suffering}} from the flu while on an assignment for salon.com to cover the Iowa caucuses, he was so angered by televised remarks in opposition to same-sex marriage by conservative Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer that he abandoned his original plan [...] "to follow one of the loopy conservative Christian candidates around—Bauer or Alan Keyes—and write something insightful and humanizing about him, his campaign, and his supporters". Instead, he volunteered for the Bauer campaign {{with the intent to}} infect the candidate with his flu. He wrote that <b>he</b> <b>licked</b> doorknobs and other objects in the campaign office, and handed Bauer a saliva-coated pen, hoping to pass the virus on to Bauer and his supporters. (Later he said much of his article had been fictitious). He also registered and participated in the caucus, which was illegal, as Savage was not an Iowa resident. He was charged and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent voting in a caucus, and was sentenced to a year's probation, 50 hours of community service, and a $750 fine.|$|E

2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When <b>he</b> <b>licked</b> his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|E

60|$|A jungle path. A lion's roar, {{a melancholy}} {{suffering}} roar, {{comes from the}} jungle. It is repeated nearer. The lion limps from the jungle on three legs, holding up his right forepaw, in which a huge thorn sticks. He sits down and contemplates it. <b>He</b> <b>licks</b> it. <b>He</b> shakes it. He tries to extract it by scraping it along the ground, and hurts himself worse. He roars piteously. <b>He</b> <b>licks</b> it again. Tears drop from his eyes. He limps painfully off the path and lies down under the trees, exhausted with pain. Heaving a long sigh, like wind in a trombone, he goes to sleep.|$|R
