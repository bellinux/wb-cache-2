5|$|Anaheim University in {{cooperation}} with the Kurosawa Family established the Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film to offer online and blended learning programs on Akira Kurosawa and filmmaking. The animated Wes Anderson film, Isle of Dogs, is partially inspired by Kurosawa's filming techniques. At the 64th Sydney Film Festival, there was a retrospective of Akira Kurosawa where films of his were screened to remember the great legacy he has created <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano had {{symptoms}} of syphilis, {{which he had}} caught during his time in Europe. This sickness forced him to take long leaves <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in the Consulate, and to suggest his cousin Juan José Castelli, who had similar ideas, as a possible replacement during his leaves. Rejection by the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796.|$|E

5|$|Charles T. Hinde (July 12, 1832– March 10, 1915) was an American industrialist, tycoon, riverboat captain, businessman, and entrepreneur. He managed many {{businesses}} and invested in numerous business ventures {{over the course}} of his life. Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation, shipping, railroad, and hotel businesses. By his late forties, Hinde had already amassed a great fortune <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in the steamboat and railroad industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> at Duff House. There was no formal contract, and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework. Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and the matter was initially resolved in his favour. However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on the fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, {{and he wanted to}} visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E

5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be disconnected <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In all of Cook's {{overseas}} recordings his surname is Cooke {{to distinguish}} it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in the United States. The male members of The Cook Family Singers have always used just their middle initials as a trademark, a trait beginning back in 1885 {{when the first}} such group was formed.|$|E
5|$|The Truman {{family moved}} into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, {{including}} the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked to and <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> {{across the street}} each morning and afternoon. In due course, {{the decision was made}} to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E

5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge}} of the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over two years}} and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E

5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought {{that he might be}} more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} arising <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> with Douglas and {{the film}} studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E
