5|$|A frieze is {{a coarse}} woollen cloth that usually has a nap on one side. It was <b>hard-wearing</b> and well-suited for outer garments, and was popular with working men.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a <b>hard-wearing,</b> creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in <b>hard-wearing</b> beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Goatskin is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} gloves. It is <b>hard-wearing</b> but coarser than other leathers and is normally used for cheaper gloves.|$|E
25|$|The {{coastline}} around Tintagel {{is significant}} because it is composed of old Devonian slate; about a mile southwards from Tintagel towards Treknow the coastline was quarried extensively for this <b>hard-wearing</b> roofing surface. Quarries inland at Trebarwith and Trevillet continued to be worked until the mid-20th century. Apart from the island headlands on the coast include Willapark and Start Point.|$|E
500|$|It {{produces}} a <b>hard-wearing,</b> white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age. The wood {{can be worked}} and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and parquetry. [...] Because it is non-staining, is used for kitchen utensils, wooden spoons, bowls, rolling pins and chopping boards. In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes, sometimes in association with contrasting, dark-coloured laburnum wood. The reference to the [...] "white maple" [...] in the English Christmas carol, [...] "Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town", [...] in [...] "Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree" [...] presumably refers not to the silver or white maple (A. saccharinum), which does not occur naturally in Europe, but to the white wood of the sycamore or the field maple, Acer campestre.|$|E
2500|$|Peccary is the world’s rarest {{and most}} luxurious gloving leather. [...] Peccary leather is very soft, [...] {{difficult}} to sew, and <b>hard-wearing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Deerskin has {{the benefit}} of great {{strength}} and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than [...] "hairsheep". It is very <b>hard-wearing</b> and heavier in weight.|$|E
2500|$|Real {{coatings}} do {{not reach}} perfect performance, {{though they are}} capable of reducing a surface reflection coefficient to less than 0.1%. Also, the layer will have the ideal thickness for only one distinct wavelength of light. Other difficulties include finding suitable materials for use on ordinary glass, since few useful substances have the required refractive index (...) that will make both reflected rays exactly equal in intensity. Magnesium fluoride (MgF2) is often used, since this is <b>hard-wearing</b> and can be easily applied to substrates using physical vapor deposition, even though its index is higher than desirable (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Berthelot's duties {{meant that}} he was {{frequently}} absent from the château, so the responsibility for supervising the building works fell to his wife, Philippa Lesbahy. These took time, since {{it was difficult to}} lay solid foundations in the damp ground of this island in the Indre, and the château had to be raised on stilts driven into the mud. Even once the foundations were laid, construction still progressed slowly, as much of the stone for the château came from the Saint-Aignan quarry, which was famous for its <b>hard-wearing</b> rock but was also around [...] away, meaning that the heavy blocks had to be transported to Azay-le-Rideau by boat.|$|E
60|$|He {{said there}} was some comfort in that thought, and went off then to spend his last evening for many months with his wife. For all his wildness, Bunter had made no mistake in his marrying. He had married a lady. A perfect lady. She was a dear little woman, too. As to her pluck, I, who know what times {{they had to go}} through, I cannot admire her enough for it. Real, <b>hard-wearing</b> every day and day after day pluck that only a woman is capable of when she is of the right sort--the undismayed sort I would call it.|$|E

50|$|Once printed, {{the surface}} of cold foil images may be varnished, laminated, or {{encapsulated}} {{in order to provide}} a <b>hard-wearing,</b> durable surface.|$|E
50|$|The name Triton is {{associated}} in modern industry with tough <b>hard-wearing</b> machines {{such as the}} Ford Triton engine and Mitsubishi Triton pickup truck.|$|E
50|$|The word, majolica, is {{also used}} for Victorian majolica, a <b>hard-wearing</b> type of pottery where {{coloured}} lead glazes are applied direct to the 'biscuit'.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor is}} {{concrete}} {{so that the}} ball will bounce well. The walls may be stone, brick or concrete but covered in a layer of <b>hard-wearing</b> plaster.|$|E
5000|$|In Old English, [...] "Bromford" [...] means [...] "broom ford", {{signifying}} {{abundance of}} broom shrubs (or similar <b>hard-wearing</b> plants) and a location {{to cross the}} River Tame.|$|E

5000|$|Deerskin has {{the benefit}} of great {{strength}} and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than [...] "hairsheep". It is very <b>hard-wearing</b> and heavier in weight.|$|E
50|$|The hill {{is formed}} from {{relatively}} <b>hard-wearing</b> sandstones of the South Wales Lower Coal Measures with mudstone layers between the sandstones which here dip steeply northwards into the South Wales Coalfield syncline.|$|E
50|$|Much like aerospace, {{lighter and}} {{stronger}} materials {{would be useful}} for creating vehicles that are both faster and safer. Combustion engines might also benefit from parts that are more <b>hard-wearing</b> and more heat-resistant.|$|E
50|$|Eggshell paint also {{refers to}} a type of <b>hard-wearing</b> wall paint with the same matte sheen as an egg's shell, rather than the same color; {{consequently}} eggshell paint can be any color, not just off-white.|$|E
5000|$|The mass-produced {{earthenware}} {{decorated with}} coloured lead glazes, made in Britain, Europe and the US; typically <b>hard-wearing,</b> with moulded surfaces, vibrant translucent glazes, in classical or naturalistic styles often with {{an element of}} High Victorian whimsy.|$|E
5000|$|Russia leather is a {{particular}} form of bark-tanned cow leather. It is distinguished by an oiling step, after tanning, where birch oil is worked into the leather to make it particularly <b>hard-wearing,</b> flexible and resistant to water.|$|E
5000|$|Bilibo is a [...] "shell-shaped, <b>hard-wearing</b> {{piece of}} plastic" [...] {{used as a}} toy. It is {{produced}} in six different colors. It was developed in 2001 by Swiss designer Alex Hochstrasser in consultation with experts for child development.|$|E
50|$|Plain weave (also called tabby weave, linen weave or taffeta weave) is {{the most}} basic of three {{fundamental}} types of textile weaves (along with satin weave and twill). It is strong and <b>hard-wearing,</b> used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>hard-wearing</b> leather look {{close contact}} jump saddle suited for riders who prefer greater freedom of {{movement}} in the seat. Ideal for developing a strong, balanced rider position. This saddle is made from [...] "Equi-Leather" [...] and features short, synthetic, interchangeable girth points.|$|E
50|$|Limestone rock {{is found}} {{in much of the}} parish. Box Ground, a <b>hard-wearing</b> variety of Bath stone, was {{extracted}} at quarries such as Box Mine which are now closed. As of 2015 the remaining source of Box Ground is Hartham Park quarry at Corsham.|$|E
50|$|Artificial turf is {{surface of}} {{synthetic}} fibers resembling natural grass. It {{is widely used}} for sports fields for being more <b>hard-wearing</b> and resistant than natural surfaces. Most use infills of crumb rubber from recycled tires, which use is controversial because of concerns that the tires contain carcinogens.|$|E
50|$|Running shorts are {{designed}} to facilitate comfort and free movement during exercise. Their materials are lightweight and <b>hard-wearing.</b> Many running shorts include an inner lining that acts as underwear, so you don't have to wear underwear with running shorts. Polyester is a common fabric in running shorts.|$|E
50|$|All bar grips are crossplies, {{having been}} {{developed}} {{when this was}} the only practical means of manufacturing tyres. The simple pattern of bar grips also made them easy to manufacture and <b>hard-wearing,</b> even if made from poor quality or ersatz rubber, bulked up with extreme quantities of non-rubber fillers.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{hardness}} of the coating {{it can be used}} to salvage worn parts. Coatings of 25 to 100 micrometres can be applied and machined back to final dimensions. Its uniform deposition profile mean it can be applied to complex components not readily suited to other <b>hard-wearing</b> coatings like hard chromium.|$|E
50|$|Often made of <b>hard-wearing</b> fabrics, such as herringbones or tweeds, {{it was not}} {{a formal}} coat at the time, though in the 20th century a cape would be seen as such. After the Edwardian period, it lost its cape, and {{continued}} {{to be used as a}} heavy-duty overcoat, often in a double-breasted style.|$|E
50|$|Russia leather is a {{particular}} form of bark-tanned cow leather. It is distinguished by a later processing step, after tanning, where birch oil is worked into the rear face of the leather. This gives a leather that is particularly <b>hard-wearing,</b> flexible and resistant to water. The oil impregnation also deterred insect attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{resistive}} element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of graphite. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called cermet.Conductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain <b>hard-wearing</b> resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, {{in addition to}} the carbon that provides the conductive properties.|$|E
