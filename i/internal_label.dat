40|$|The bright {{fluorescent}} cytosine analogue tCO {{stands out}} among fluorescent bases {{due to its}} virtually unquenched fluorescence emission in duplex DNA. However, like most reported base analogues, {{it has not been}} thoroughly characterized in RNA. We here report on the first synthesis and RNA-incorporation of tCO, and characterize its base-mimicking and fluorescence properties in RNA. As in DNA, we find a high quantum yield inside RNA duplexes ( = 0. 22) that is virtually unaffected by the neighbouring bases (?F = 0. 20 - 0. 25), resulting in an average brightness of 1900 M- 1 cm- 1. The average fluorescence lifetime in RNA duplexes is 4. 3 ns and generally two lifetimes are required to fit the exponential decays. Fluorescence properties in ssRNA are defined by a small increase in average quantum yield ( = 0. 24) compared to dsRNA, with a broader distribution (?F = 0. 17 - 0. 34) and slightly shorter average lifetimes. Using circular dichroism, we find that the tCO-modified RNA duplexes form regular A-form helices and in UV-melting experiments the stability of the duplexes is only slightly higher than that of the corresponding natural RNA ( = + 2. 3 °C). These properties make tCO a highly interesting fluorescent RNA base analogue for detailed FRET-based structural measurements, as a bright <b>internal</b> <b>label</b> in microscopy, and for fluorescence anisotropy measurements of RNA dynamics...|$|E

Fluorescein - dATP was used in a second reaction, followed by termination with ddGTP and ddTTP in a 3 : 1 ratio. The fragments were pooled and separated by capillary gel electrophoresis. The results were compared with peak-height encoded sequencing based on fluorescently labeled primers. The dye-labeled primers produced higher resolution separations for shorter fragments. However, dye-labeled primer fragments suffered from an earlier onset of biased reptation and produced shorter sequencing reads.

40|$|Mismatch-specific endonucleases are {{efficient}} {{tools for}} the targeted scanning of populations for subtle DNA variations. Conventional protocols involve 5 -labeled amplicon substrates and {{the detection of}} digestion products by LIF electrophoresis. A shortcoming of such protocols, however, is the limited 5 -signal strength. Normally the sensitivity of fluorescent DNA analyzers is superior to that of intercalating dye/agarose systems, however, pooling capacities of the former and latter approaches to mismatch scanning are somewhat similar. Detection is further limited by significant background. We investigated the activity of CEL nucleases using amplicon substrates labeled both internally and at each 5 -terminus. The amplicons were generated from exon 8 of the rice starch synthase IIa encoding gene. Signal of both 5 -labels was significantly reduced by enzyme activity, while that of the <b>internal</b> <b>label</b> was largely unaffected. In addition, background resulting from internal labeling was a significant improvement on that associated with 5 -labeling. Sizing of the multilabeled substrates suggests that 5 -modification enhances exonucleolytic activity, resulting in {{the removal of the}} dye-labeled terminal nucleotides. We have developed an alternative approach to mismatch detection, in which amplicon labeling is achieved via the incorporation of fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotides, which we have named Endonucleolytic Mutation Analysis by Internal Labeling (EMAIL). The strength of the EMAIL assay was demonstrated by the reclassification of a rice line as being heterozygous for the starch gene. This cultivar was assigned as being homozygous by a previous resequencing study. EMAIL shows potential for the clear identification of multiple mutations amongst allelic pools...|$|E
40|$|We study {{here the}} arising of Kelvin [...] Helmholtz Instability (KHI) in one fast jet of 2014 April 16 {{observed}} by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in different UV and EUV wavelengths. The evolution of jet indicates the blob like structure at its boundary {{which could be}} the observational evidence of the KHI. We model the jet as a moving cylindrical magnetic flux tube of radius $a$ embedded in a magnetic field B_i and surrounded by rest magnetized plasma with magnetic field B_e. We explore the propagation of the kink MHD mode along the jet that can become unstable against the KHI if its speed exceeds a critical value. Concerning magnetic fields topology we consider three different configurations, notably of (i) spatially homogeneous magnetic fields (untwisted magnetic flux tube), (ii) <b>internal</b> (<b>label</b> `i') twisted magnetic field and external homogeneous one (label `e') (single-twisted flux tube), and (iii) {{both internal and external}} twisted magnetic fields (double-twisted magnetic flux tube). Plasma densities in the two media rho_i and rho_e are assumed to be homogeneous. The density contrast is defined in two ways: first as rho_e/rho_i and second as rho_e/(rho_i + rho_e). Computations show that the KHI can occur at accessible flow velocities in all the cases of untwisted and single-twisted flux tubes. It turns out, however, {{that in the case of}} a double-twisted flux tube the KHI can merge at an accessible jet speed only when the density contrast is calculated from the ratio rho_e/(rho_i} + rho_e). Evaluated KHI developing times and kink mode wave phase velocities at wavelength of 4 Mm lie in the ranges of 1 [...] 6. 2 min and 202 [...] 271 km/s, respectively [...] -all being reasonable for the modeled jet.

Operational models of concurrent computation typically describe processes in terms of a state space together with its possible evolution by performing atomic actions. Transition systems have proved useful in modelling the kinds of processes involved in static networks, like those described by CCS and related calculi. In these situations, processes evolve by communicating along named channels. Modern systems, though, often contain an element of mobility and reconfiguration. In languages such as the π-calculus, this dynamic structure is described in terms of the communication of the channel names themselves: name-passing. This allows, for instance, one process to advise another process to begin communicating on a particular channel. Not surprisingly, techniques and models relevant to static networks are inadequate in the name-passing context. Thus operational models of name-passing process calculi have been investigated. ⋆ This paper supersedes the extended abstract with the same title that appeared i...|$|R

The monoclonal antibody OKT 6 was detected {{with the use of}} goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein (FITC) for light microscopy, and sheep antimouse Fab' 2 fragment of IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for immunoelectron microscopy. The presence of S- 100 protein was revealed by an antibody prepared against bovine S- 100 protein, using sheep anti-rabbit IgG labeled with FITC for light microscopy and with HRP for immunoelectron microscopy. OKT 6 antibody and S- 100 protein were detected simultaneously by double labeling with FITC and rhodamine. In all patients with pulmonary HX, the major cellular components (HX cells) of the granulomas showed labeling of the plasma membranes by OKT 6 and of the cytoplasm by the anti S- 100 protein antibody.

We label streets either internally or externally. For <b>internal</b> <b>labels,</b> we compute potential label positions for each street, compare them, and decide for one. For external street labels, we apply a force-directed approach; labels behave like electrons. The first algorithm for labeling points allows labels to slide along their reference points; it makes use of visibilities between labels.

Significant evidence for the internal staining of Bacillus subtilis (Gram positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram negative) using these structures is presented via steady-state emission, epifluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. In particular, the E. coli adenine auxotroph, and not the wild type, took up adenine coated quantum dots, and this only occurred in adenine deficient growth media.
