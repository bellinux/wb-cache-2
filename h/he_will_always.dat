5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be there for her if she needs someone.|$|E

But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in the story, we see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web.

Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret.

How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—Total Baseball deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, [...] "the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good anybody could manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, [...] "You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants." [...] Appel noted, [...] "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager.
