His beliefs matter to him {{both on and off}} the track: [...] "I'm a religious man, so I really believe in my God-given ability, that I can do the unexpected. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E
500|$|On September15,2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warren Campbell filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carey at the [...] 9th Circuit for {{copyright}} infringement, [...] "reverse passing off" [...] and false designation, claiming that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] borrowed heavily from a song they composed called [...] "One of Those Love Songs". It was recorded by the R group Xscape in 1998 for their album Traces of My Lipstick. The lawsuit claimed that Carey wrongfully gave the songwriting credits to Jam and Lewis. Swirsky and Campbell had sold the rights of the song to So So Def Recordings in 1998. [...] "I'm a fan of Mariah Carey; this is nothing personal against her. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> there's accountability, and it's very clear what happened here. I've never sued anybody before", Swirsky said. According to the district court, an expert witness (chair of the Musicology Department at the University of California at Los Angeles) determined that the songs shared a [...] "substantially similar chorus". The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B. The expert further remarked that [...] "the emphasis on musical notes" [...] on the two songs was the same, which [...] "contribute to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs." [...] He presented a series of visual transcriptions of his observations. The transcriptions contained details about the pitch sequence of both the songs' chorus, melody, and bassline.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Klein refuted {{the charges}} of anti-Semitism in his reply, stating that he was [...] "anti-neoconservative".Listen, people can vote {{whichever}} way they want, for whatever reason they want. I just don't want to see policy makers who make decisions {{on the basis of}} whether American policy will benefit Israel or not. In some cases, you want to provide protection for Israel certainly, but you don't want {{to go to war with}} Iran. When Jennifer Rubin or Abe Foxman calls me antisemitic, they're wrong. I am anti-neoconservative. I think these people are following very perversely extremist policies and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> that it was time for mainstream Jews to stand up and say, [...] "They don't represent us, they don't represent Israel." ...|$|R

'Well, I have been thinking of that, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> there was anything in it. I did make myself rather a fool at Beauchastel, and Jem would have made me a greater one; but you know my father {{put a stop to}} it. Thinking her handsomer than other people can't be love, can it?' ...|$|R

"I {{have seen}} one of the proprietors and the editor," [...] said the lawyer, [...] "and they are quite willing to apologise. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> they are very sorry.

2500|$|The plot is {{not based}} on the storyline in the {{original}} book by Gaston Leroux. Lloyd Webber stated: [...] "I don't regard this as a sequel—it's a stand-alone piece." [...] He later clarified: [...] "Clearly, it is a sequel, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> {{that you have to have}} seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies." [...] The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is [...] "ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.|$|R

"I can't explain it," [...] says Mr. Franklin; [...] "but, if {{the girl}} IS {{concerned}} {{in the loss}} of the Diamond, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> she was on the point of confessing everything--to me, of {{all the people in the}} world--not two minutes since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{more than}} half true," [...] she said to herself--"{{more than half}}. Here am I, twenty years old, and never have thought of any thing, never done any thing, except to amuse and gratify myself; no purpose, no object; nothing high, nothing dignified, nothing worth living for! Only a parlor ornament--heigh ho! Well, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> I could do {{something}} with this Elliot; and yet how dare I try?" ...|$|E

I mean, I'm glad! It was experience: oh, and past. I loved it and the streets, and the shops, and all those grinning, gnashing faces, and even you.... It was wildly exciting, Mr Crimble, can't you see? And now"--I ended triumphantly--"and now I have another novel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Arthur turned {{towards him}} with a pained expression. 'Father,' he said, half reproachfully, 'Father, dear father, dou't talk to me like that. Don't think I'm so shallow or so dishonest as to {{subscribe}} to opinions I don't believe in. It's a curious thing to say, a curious thing in this unbelieving age, and I'm half ashamed to say it, even to you; but do you know, father, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> it: in my very heart of hearts, I fancy I believe every word of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Viewing this {{suggestion}} as another act of impertinence {{on the part}} of the Baroness, I persisted in my intention of going to the concert. It was for the Princess to decide what course of conduct I was bound to follow. What did I care for the Doctor's report to the Duke! Shall I own my folly? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> was jealous of the Duke.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{interposed}} the old lady, {{before her}} son could answer, [...] "if Charles <b>does</b> <b>believe</b> in omens, {{it is nothing}} to laugh at. You will soon know better, when you are his wife, than to confound him, even in the slightest things, with the common herd of people. All his convictions are well founded--so well, that if <b>I</b> thought he <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> in omens, <b>I</b> should most assuredly {{make up my mind}} to believe in them too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, Bonaparte {{had some}} strong points about him, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe.</b> But {{he could have}} been nothing to the Leather-stocking, in the woods! It's no great matter, young gentleman, to be a great man among your {{inhabitants}} of cities--what I call umbrella people. Why, Natty was almost as great with the spear as with the rifle; though I never heard that he got a sight of the sogdollager." ...|$|R

[HE.] If I were the maid I should meet the lad half way - (For <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that timid youth will die!) [BOTH.] I thank you much for your counsel true; I've learnt what that poor soul ought to do! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear child, I'm sure of him, for my {{experience}} {{has made me}} very sharp and I'm convinced I can manage him without a bit of trouble. We've {{known each other for}} ages" [...] Steve was twenty and Kitty eighteen [...] "and always been the best of friends. Besides, he is quite my ideal man. I never could bear big hands and feet, and his are simply adorable. Then he's the best dancer I know and dresses in perfect taste. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> I fell in love with his pocket handkerchiefs first, they were so enchanting I couldn't resist," [...] laughed Kitty, pulling a large one out of her pocket and burying her little nose in the folds, which shed a delicious fragrance upon the air.|$|E
6000|$|... 'George Sarawia will (D.V.) {{start with}} a little company of Christian friends at his own island. The {{scholars}} from all the different islands fraternise excellently well, {{and in many cases}} the older and more advanced have their regular chums, by private arrangement among themselves, whom they help, and to whose islands they are quite prepared to be sent, if I think fit so to arrange; and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that from the Banks Islands we may send out missionaries to many of the Melanesian islands, as from Samoa and Karotonga they have gone out to the islands of the Eastern Pacific. Humanly speaking, I see no difficulty in our drawing into our central school here any number of natives that we can support, from the New Hebrides, Banks and Solomon Islands, and I trust soon from the Santa Cruz Islands also.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} {{impossible}}," [...] he answered. [...] "My father ordered the step himself, {{and he is}} a hard man. It is impossible to turn him if he thinks he will lose money by turning.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone Australia, Mac described the song saying; “I feel like I wrote this song from myself to myself {{as some sort of}} reminder. Doing the right thing is hard and sometimes it is way easier to pretend you don't give a shit. Deep down I think we all give a shit and that everything has to be alright if you want it to be. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a real, honest, good fellow," [...] said Babie. [...] "I'm {{sorry for}} Bobus, but I've known Cecil almost all my life, and I can't have him abused. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Essie will be happier with a simple-hearted fellow like him, {{than with a}} clever man like Bobus, who has places in his mind she could never reach up to, and lucky for her too," [...] half whispered Babie at the end.|$|R
60|$|In {{every town}} where we stay, though it be {{only for a}} day, we hold a regular levée or drawing-room, where I shake hands on an average with five or six hundred people, who pass on from me to Kate, and are shaken again by her. Maclise's picture of our darlings stands upon a table or {{sideboard}} the while; and my travelling secretary, assisted very often by a committee belonging to the place, presents the people in due form. Think of two hours of this every day, and the people coming in by hundreds, all fresh, and piping hot, and full of questions, when we are literally exhausted and can hardly stand. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that if I had not a lady with me, I should have been obliged {{to leave the country}} and go back to England. But for her they never would leave me alone by day or night, and as it is, a slave comes to me now and then {{in the middle of the}} night with a letter, and waits at the bedroom door for an answer.|$|E
60|$|Did {{she ever}} take a roll before like that last? Did she ever take a roll before like this worse {{one that is}} coming now? Here is the {{partition}} at my ear down in the deep on the lee side. Are we ever coming up again together? I think not; the partition and I are so long about it that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> we have overdone it this time. Heavens, what a scoop! What a deep scoop, what a hollow scoop, what a long scoop! Will it ever end, and can we bear the heavy mass of water we have taken on board, and which has let loose all the table furniture in the officers' mess, and has beaten {{open the door of}} the little passage between the purser and me, and is swashing about, even there and even here? The purser snores reassuringly, and the ship's bells striking, I hear the cheerful 'All's well!' of the watch musically given back the length of the deck, as the lately diving partition, now high in air, tries (unsoftened by what we have gone through together) to force me out of bed and berth.|$|E
6000|$|And we {{also did}} admirable things with our next subsidiaries, [...] "Tono-Bungay Lozenges," [...] and [...] "Tono-Bungay Chocolate." [...] These we urged upon {{the public for}} their {{extraordinary}} nutritive and recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain. We gave them posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously vertical cliffs, cyclist champions upon the track, mounted messengers engaged in Aix-to-Ghent rides, soldiers lying out in action under a hot sun. [...] "You can GO for twenty-four hours," [...] we declared, [...] "on Tono-Bungay Chocolate." [...] We didn't say whether you could return on the same commodity. We also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister, wig, side-whiskers, teeth, a horribly life-like portrait of all existing barristers, talking at a table, and beneath, this legend: [...] "A Four Hours' Speech on Tono-Bungay Lozenges, and as fresh as when he began." [...] Then brought in regiments of school-teachers, revivalist ministers, politicians and the like. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> there was an element of [...] "kick" [...] in the strychnine in these lozenges, especially in those made according to our earlier formula. For we altered all our formulae--invariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you wrong me," [...] replied Lucy, {{with great}} solemnity; [...] "I know nobody of whose {{judgment}} I think so highly as I do of yours; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe,</b> {{that if you}} was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means {{to put an end}} to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is hard {{to write}} you this, but he {{actually}} made the condition of my acceptance of the inheritance that I should not marry you. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> convinced him that you wouldn't have me take the money under any circumstances. And the dreadful side of it all was that I {{had to make it}} plain to him--after what has happened that my desire to marry you wasn't the main reason of my refusal. I had to tell him that even though you had not been in question, I couldn't have taken what he wished to give me, since it had not been honestly made. He asked me why I went on eating the food bought with such money, living under his roof? But I cannot, I will not leave him just yet.... It is two o'clock. I cannot write any more to-night." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Mapleside now came in, and {{was very}} {{surprised}} and glad to see Polly. We confided to her, under promise of strict secrecy, the good news Polly had come down to bring; a promise which the dear old lady did not keep, for she was so delighted and full of it, that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> she could have kept it to herself had her life depended upon it. So she informed--also in the strictest confidence--three or four of her most intimate friends, and as these were the greatest gossips in Canterbury, {{it was not long}} before the whole town knew of it; and, although I would, perhaps, rather that it had not been known, yet I could not be vexed with the kind old lady, for I was very pleased at the sincere pleasure all my friends seemed to feel at my happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} haven't been giving all {{your time and}} beauty-sleep doing {{too much of that}} {{settlement}} work, Ruthie--and Heaven only knows what germs you will get there--of course I should be the first to praise any work for the poor, ungrateful and shiftless though they are--what with my committees and the Truegate Temperance Home for Young Working Girls--it's all very well to be sympathetic with them, {{but when it comes to}} a settlement-house, and Heaven knows I have given them all the counsel and suggestions I could, though some of the professional settlement workers are as pert as they can be, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> some of them think they are trying to end poverty entirely, just as though the Lord would have sent poverty into the world if He didn't have a very good reason for it--you will remember the Bible says, 'The poor you always have with you,' and as Florence Barclay says in her novels, which may seem a little sentimental, but they are of such a good moral effect, you can't supersede the Scriptures even in the most charming social circles. To say nothing of the blessings of poverty, I'm sure they're much happier than we are, with our onerous duties, I'm sure that if any of these ragamuffin anarchists and socialists and anti-militarists want to take over my committees they are welcome, if they'll take over the miserable headaches and worried hours they give me, trying to do something for the poor, they won't even be clean but even in model tenements they will put coal in the bath-tubs. And so I do hope you haven't just been wearing yourself to a bone working for ungrateful dirty little children, Ruthie." ...|$|E
50|$|BATTERED SOUL: O, no. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in peace.|$|E
5000|$|Cuts to {{the budget}} of the Ontario Provincial Police also proved to be a problem. The police union stoked fears that the cuts would endanger public safety. This was {{dismissed}} as fear-mongering by Pilkey. He said, [...] "I do welcome their suggestions but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> if someone is trying to paint a Draconian, desperate picture, it perhaps is a reach." ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel's laugh rippled. How {{very clever}} her husband was. [...] "I shall {{keep you from}} forgetting this afternoon," [...] she promised. [...] "I am so glad {{to go out in}} a machine. <b>Really</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> I could sit the saddle to-day. And this is too nice!" [...] she declared, as she poured the coffee. [...] "Are you not going down?" [...] Then she {{extended}} a steaming cup. [...] "Take this," [...] she begged. [...] "They have sent plenty for two; suppose we have breakfast together." ...|$|R
60|$|As to {{objections}} {{which may}} lie against {{any of the}} proposals made in this book, I have in some places mentioned such as occurred to my thoughts. I shall never assume that arrogance to pretend no other or further objections may be raised; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> no such objection can be raised as will overthrow any scheme here laid down so as to render the thing impracticable. Neither do I think but that all men will acknowledge most of the proposals in this book would be of as great, and perhaps greater, advantage to the public than I have pretended to.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall never}} rest much while my faculties last, and (if I know myself) {{have a certain}} {{something}} in me that would still be active in rusting and corroding me, if I flattered myself that I was in repose. On the other hand, I think that my habit of easy self-abstraction and withdrawal into fancies has always refreshed and strengthened me in short intervals wonderfully. I always seem to myself to have rested far more than I have worked; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> have some exceptional faculty of accumulating young feelings in short pauses, which obliterates a quantity of wear and tear.|$|R
