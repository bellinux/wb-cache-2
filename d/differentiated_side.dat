50|$|The {{building}} is 70 ft wide, and 90 ft deep. It has a main space of 7000 sq ft (and an assembly room of 4000 sq ft), and 50 ft high cathedral blue ceilings. It has pointed arch tall lancet windows (originally surrounded by trefoil tracery and moldings) and doorways (surrounded by parts of moldings showing engaged columns and foliate capitals). Its larger center door is crowned by triangular molding {{that is almost}} {{as high as the}} second floor, which contains a Magen David with thin pinnacles on either side. It also has interior wooden vaults, and several balconies (one of which houses Angel Orensanz's studio). It has a tripartite front facade of red stone brick, covered with stucco, framed at its top by a pointed gable. Originally, the building was three stories high and topped by concave pyramidal roofs with finials atop them, but today it is two stories high and topped by buttressed, clearly <b>differentiated</b> <b>side</b> square towers {{on either side of the}} center section. The towers were an unusual feature at the time they were built, containing articulated stairwells to the galleries. Its original ceiling was deep blue, with gold stars.|$|E

40|$|Single-molecule {{measurements}} of complex biological {{structures such as}} proteins are an attractive route for determining structures of {{the large number of}} important biomolecules that have proved refractory to analysis through standard techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. We use a custom-built low-current scanning tunneling microscope to image peptide structures at the single-molecule scale in a model peptide that forms β sheets, a structural motif common in protein misfolding diseases. We successfully differentiate between histidine and alanine amino acid residues, and further <b>differentiate</b> <b>side</b> chain orientations in individual histidine residues, by correlating features in scanning tunneling microscope images with those in energy-optimized models. Beta sheets containing histidine residues are used as a model system due to the role histidine plays in transition metal binding associated with amyloid oligomerization in Alzheimer's and other diseases. Such measurements are a first step toward analyzing peptide and protein structures at the single-molecule level. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
