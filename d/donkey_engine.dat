5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E

60|$|It is {{afternoon}} of {{a sunny day}} about a week later. From the harbor and docks outside, muffled by the closed door and windows, comes the sound of steamers' whistles and the puffing snort of the <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> of some ship unloading nearby.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{commanding}} {{position that the}} Point offered over the entire upper Nushagak Bay, it suffered from extensive and growing mud flats that limited access to vessels except during the bay's extreme high tides. Nushagak Point remains the location of some productive salmon set net sites. Artifacts from the cannery era, such as <b>donkey</b> <b>engines,</b> still remain.|$|R
25|$|John Dolbeer (March 12, 1827 – August 17, 1902) was {{a partner}} in the Dolbeer & Carson Lumber Co., one of the early major Humboldt County, California lumber {{operations}} based in Eureka. While in that business, he invented the logging engine, more commonly known as the steam donkey or <b>donkey</b> <b>engine.</b> This invaluable equipment, especially with regard to difficult terrain and very large trees, revolutionized 19th century logging so significantly that variations of the engine were still used well into the 20th Century.|$|E
25|$|On recovery, the {{artefact}} {{was found}} to be in very fragile condition with the cast iron shell badly corroded and incomplete. Additionally there is evidence to suggest that the artefact is missing many of its mountings such as the aerator, connecting pipes and <b>donkey</b> <b>engine.</b> It is inconclusive whether these materials were removed by agents operating {{under the direction of the}} owner Charles Edward Broadhurst (1826 – 26 April 1905) in the initial salvaging of the wreck in 1872 or by treasure hunters in more recent times.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{abandoned}} <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the forest}} near {{the west bank of}} the Clearwater River at Marcus Falls. It can be seen from the viewpoint in late fall when leaves are off the trees, but otherwise it is not accessible. It was moved here in the winter of 1912-13 when the Canadian Northern Railway was being planned and some loggers figured they could get the contract for the Clearwater River bridge at Bailey's Chute if they had a donkey on site. The 10-ton machine was skidded over the ice of Canim Lake, rafted along Mahood Lake in the spring, then winched to this location. The men had already cut 9000 cubic meters of timber when the railway was confirmed along a different route.|$|E
5000|$|The Willamette {{locomotive}} was an improved-upon clone of the Shay locomotive {{produced in}} limited number by Willamette Iron & Steel (better {{known for their}} steam <b>donkey</b> <b>engines)</b> after key patents expired. West coast logging customers were clamoring for improvements in detail design {{and the application of}} more modern locomotive technology to the geared locomotive; Lima (manufacturers of the Shay) were dragging their heels. The Willamette was the response to that.|$|R
2500|$|The turret's rounded shape {{helped to}} deflect cannon shot. A pair of <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> rotated the turret through {{a set of}} gears; a full {{rotation}} was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. This design was technologically inferior to Coles', and made fine control of the turret difficult. [...] If turret rotation overshot its mark it was difficult to make a correction. Either the engine would have to be placed in reverse or another full rotation was necessary.|$|R
50|$|In 1888 George Key {{opened up}} his own shop above his father John Key's first-floor draper shop on Lower Brook Street in Rugeley Staffordshire, England. That same year, Key {{designed}} {{a new type of}} coat made of a hard-wearing material developed for those who were working on the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. Some of the navvies worked on <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> (a steam-powered winch or logging engine), providing the inspiration for the name of George Key's new coat: the donkey jacket.|$|R
2500|$|Hooligan {{had been}} placed in service by June 3, 1909, and was first used as a pile driver. [...] Shortly after that the steamer was sent to the Odessa {{vicinity}} to work towing logs for the Long Lake Lumber Company. [...] On Saturday, June 12, 1909, Hooligan transported a logging <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> for the Lake Lumber Company.|$|E

2500|$|On April 8, 1930, George M. Brown, with a log raft in tow, and Capt. Mike Lollis in command, ran aground on {{the north}} sand spit at the {{entrance}} to Siletz Bay. [...] The grounding was said to have been caused by cross currents and strong northeast wind. [...] The tug Craig was sent from Taft to assist Brown, but itself went aground. [...] Craig was able to get free, but dustained some damage. [...] Brown was still owned by the Anchor Towing Company, but at the time was being operated for Lincoln County Logging Co. [...] Two days later Moore was pulled free with the use of steam <b>donkey</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

A pair of <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> rotated the turret through {{a set of}} gears; a full {{rotation}} was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately 160 LT; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Hurlbut broke {{ground on}} {{building}} the Timber Mountain Log Ride, another collaboration with Arrow Development, which, {{along with the}} Mine Ride, is still {{considered one of the}} iconic rides of the park, {{and one of the most}} popular. Many guests ride it twice or more when they visit - on some days the turnstile ridership of the Log Ride exceeds that of the front gate of the park. The ride demonstrates great attention to detail, which is the key characteristic of Hurlbut's creations. Many of the items seen on the ride are actual cast-iron gears, steam <b>donkey</b> <b>engines,</b> and sawmill equipment from over a hundred years ago.|$|R
5000|$|This project mainly {{includes}} combined electrical {{generation and}} heating systems for private homes and small villages burning wood or bamboo chips. This {{is intended to}} replace 2-stroke <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> and small diesel power plants. Drastic reduction in noise level is one immediate benefit of a steam-powered small plant. Ted Pritchard, of Melbourne, Australia, was intensively developing this type of unit from 2002 {{until his death in}} 2007. The company Pritchard Power (now Uniflow Power) [...] stated in 2010 that they continue to develop the stationary S5000, and that a prototype had been built and was being tested, and designs were being refined for market ready products.|$|R
2500|$|By 1918, the boilers on Bellingham were {{considered}} too worn {{out for the}} vessel to be of any further service as a powered ship. [...] The fittings and machinery was therefore removed and scrapped by the firm of Neider & Marcus. [...] In March 1919 Bellingham was sold to H.C. Strong who was doing business as the Sunny Point Packing Company. [...] The powerless vessel {{was taken to the}} King and Winge shipyard in West Seattle which converted the ship into an unpowered sailing barge which still retained the name Bellingham. [...] A <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> with steam driven by a vertical boiler was installed, which powered two cargo hoists. [...] The vessel was also rigged with auxiliary sails, although these appear to not have been used very much.|$|E
2500|$|In 1863 Carson and John Dolbeer {{formed the}} Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. Eighteen {{years later in}} 1881, as the company {{advanced}} into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam <b>Donkey</b> <b>Engine</b> which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard to reach areas. At about the same time, Carson {{was involved in the}} founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, [...] "If I build it poorly, they would say that I am a damned miser; if I build it expensively, they will say I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself." [...] In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing [...] of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, {{set the stage for the}} unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play Ingomar the Barbarian.|$|E

5000|$|A small {{armoured}} pilot {{house was}} fitted {{on the upper}} deck towards the bow, however, its position prevented Monitor from firing her guns straight forward. [...] Like Coles, one of Ericsson's goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire. The turret's rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> rotated the turret {{through a set of}} gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862 but fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made.|$|R
50|$|It {{was long}} {{considered}} by foresters {{and government agencies}} to be a weed tree. In its earlier years, its only use was to feed the boilers of <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> bringing in the valuable pine and fir logs. There was a period in the mid 1960s when U.S. Forest Service policy in California's National Forests was systematic extermination of California black oak by girdling the trees. The objective was {{to make room for}} more coniferous growth. In the rush to utilize the pines, firs and redwoods, the dense hardwoods were looked on with contempt. Like a few other visionaries in the 1960s, Guy Hall thought the California black oak presented a beautiful challenge that deserved better than eradication. In 1965 Hall convinced federal agencies to cease their extermination polices.|$|R
50|$|The railroads, steam shovels, steam-powered cranes, rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and {{pneumatic}} power drills used {{to drill holes}} for explosives (about 30000000 lb were used) {{were some of the}} new construction equipment used to construct the canal. Nearly all this equipment was built by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and made in the United States by companies such as the Joshua Hendy Iron Works. In addition the canal used large refrigeration systems for making ice, large electrical motors to power the pumps and controls on the canal's locks, and other new technology. They built extensive electrical generation and distribution systems, one of the first large-scale uses of large electrical motors. Electricity-powered <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> pulled the ships through the locks on railroad tracks laid parallel to the locks.|$|R
60|$|But {{presently}} {{the sound}} of the <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> and the rattle of a steel cable on the hoisting-drum proclaimed the fact that the Kincaid's anchor was being raised, and a moment later the waiter heard the propellers revolving, and slowly the little steamer moved away from him out into the channel.|$|E

50|$|By the 1850s, Felton {{became the}} hub of the logging {{industry}} and the coastal redwood trees that blanketed the area became the largest export. Early loggers described the area as dense, nearly impenetrable redwood forests, howling canyons, and frequent encounters with ferocious grizzly bears, the last of which, a silvertip sow, {{is said to have been}} killed near Bonny Doon in the late 1880s. They also struggled with a lack of access and suitable transportation for the timber. Eventually the original trusty oxen were replaced by wood burning <b>donkey</b> <b>engines,</b> of which some tracks can still be found today in Lompico. Between 1890 and 1900, the entire area was clear cut and the forest is now in the process of reestablishing itself on the young, steep slopes of marine sedimentary rock common to the California coast.|$|R
2500|$|His several patents {{showed his}} {{ingenuity}} in problem solving, {{and he had}} an impact in all facets of the industry, from the actual lumbering operation itself, to transporting and exporting – even owning the barques and brigs to ship the lumber to worldwide markets. Among his most useful and successful patent was that for the Dolbeer Logging Engine in August 1881. [...] This machine was a simple steam engine mounted on a wooden skid which enabled loggers to employ cables to move giant logs across long distances or steep terrain to adjacent railways or waterways. This invention improved log retrieval in difficult terrain and revolutionized the industry. It was so cost effective and useful that the technology continued to be used well into the 20th century. Examples of working <b>Donkey</b> <b>engines</b> can still be found operating during special occasions at Fort Humboldt State Historic Park in Eureka. The patent (...) was issued April 18, 1882.|$|R
60|$|Electric lights, a shed-covered wharf, {{mountains}} of luggage and freight, the noisy toil of 'longshoremen and sailors, the staccato snorts of <b>donkey</b> <b>engines</b> and the whining sheaves as running lines {{ran through the}} blocks, a crowd of white-coated stewards carrying hand-baggage, the quartermaster at the gangway foot, the gangway sloping steeply up to the Umatilla's promenade deck, more quartermasters and gold-laced ship's officers {{at the head of}} the gangway, and more crowd and confusion blocking the narrow deck--thus Michael knew, beyond all peradventure, that he had come back to the sea and its ships, where he had first met Steward, where he had been always with Steward, save for the recent nightmare period in the great city. Nor was there absent from the flashing visions of his consciousness the images and memories of Kwaque and Cocky. Whining eagerly, he strained at the leash, risking his tender toes among the many inconsiderate, restless, leather-shod feet of the humans, as he quested and scented for Cocky and Kwaque, and, most of all, for Steward.|$|R

50|$|To {{strengthen}} her {{wooden frame}} and hull, Pretoria was constructed using steel keelson plates, steel chords, and steel arches. She also was strapped diagonally with steel. She needed a <b>donkey</b> <b>engine</b> {{to run a}} pump to keep her interior dry.|$|E
50|$|Wyoming was {{equipped}} with a Hyde anchor windlass and a <b>donkey</b> steam <b>engine</b> to raise and lower sails, haul lines and perform other tasks. The steam engine {{was not used to}} power the ship, but permitted it to be sailed with a smaller crew of only 11 hands. It was named for the state of Wyoming because Wyoming Governor Bryant Butler Brooks (1907-1921) was one of the investors in the ship, which cost $175,000 in 1909 dollars. Another Percy & Small-built schooner, the five-masted Governor Brooks, was named after Brooks.|$|R
50|$|Riding {{through two}} {{personal}} cycles of prosperity and poverty before his third and lasting success, Benson {{went into the}} business of logging in near Clatskanie, Oregon and Oak Point, Washington, downstream from Portland, buying up tracts of timber wherever he could. He introduced a number of changes to Northwest logging, including the <b>donkey</b> steam <b>engine</b> which replaced the oxen that had previously been used to haul logs. He later built the famous Benson seagoing rafts which could carry up to six million board feet (14,000 m³) of timber, cutting the cost of transporting logs to markets in California.|$|R
