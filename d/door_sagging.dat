2500|$|Round vault {{doors were}} {{popular in the}} early 20th century and are iconic images for a bank's high security. [...] They fell out of favor due to {{manufacturing}} complexities, maintenance issues (<b>door</b> <b>sag</b> due to weight) and cost, but a few examples are still available.|$|R
6000|$|Little {{by little}} {{the story of}} the country's decay came out. The village of Ordway had been moved away, nothing {{remained}} but the grain elevator. Many of our old neighbors had gone [...] "to the irrigation country" [...] and more were planning to go as soon as they could sell their farms. Columbia was also in desolate decline. Its hotel stood empty, its windows broken, its <b>doors</b> <b>sagging.</b>|$|R
60|$|The three {{defenders}} {{poured a}} few rounds through the <b>sagging</b> <b>door,</b> then Bridge {{noted that the}} Chinaman ceased firing.|$|R
50|$|A geared {{continuous}} hinge {{is a type}} of {{continuous hinge}} used mostly on doors in high-traffic entrances and features gear teeth that mesh together under a cap that runs the length of the hinge. The hinges use a number of fasteners to attach the door to the frame from top to bottom to distribute a door’s weight more evenly along the frame to stop <b>doors</b> from <b>sagging.</b> They are often used in schools, hospitals, hotels, offices, airports, stadiums, storefronts and many other commercial and industrial buildings.|$|R
500|$|By 1910 {{the fort}} was {{occupied}} as a grace and favour residence by Sir Malcolm Murray, the Comptroller to the Duke of Connaught. The Duke was {{the owner of}} [...] nearby Bagshot Park. The fort was extended with a new service wing and entrance porch in 1911–12, which was subsequently demolished. The dining and drawing rooms were also extended and new entrance lodges were built. After the departure of Murray, the fort was described as suffering from [...] "dust inches deep, splintered <b>doors</b> and <b>sagging</b> floors" [...] in 1929.|$|R
60|$|BURKE--[Talking {{aloud to}} himself.] Row, ye divil! Row! [Then lifting {{his head and}} looking about him.] What's this tub? Well, we're safe anyway--with the help of God. [He makes {{the sign of the}} cross mechanically. JOHNSON comes along the deck to port, {{supporting}} the fourth man, who is babbling to himself incoherently. BURKE glances at him disdainfully.] Is it losing the small wits ye iver had, ye are? Deck-scrubbing scut! [They pass him and go into the cabin, leaving the <b>door</b> open. BURKE <b>sags</b> forward wearily.] I'm bate out--bate out entirely.|$|R
60|$|Forgetful, in the {{excitement}} of the moment, of his terror of the horror ridden ruin, The Oskaloosa Kid hastened ahead, mounted the few steps to the verandah, crossed it and pushed open the <b>sagging</b> <b>door.</b> Behind him came Bridge as the youth entered the dark interior. A half dozen steps he took when his foot struck against a soft and yielding mass. Stumbling, he tried to regain his equilibrium only to drop full upon the thing beneath him. One open palm, extended to ease his fall, fell upon the upturned features of a cold and clammy face. With a shriek of horror The Kid leaped to his feet and shrank, trembling, back.|$|R
60|$|But when {{he looked}} about the room, and saw here and there the simple comforts and {{necessaries}} which his money had bought the sick man and the two helpless women, his heart swelled with joy and pride; and he realised the pleasure we all feel in being a good genius. At times it had come pretty hard to send {{the greater part of}} his week's wages home, but now he was glad he had done it. The poor, coarse food which his mother had served him as a treat; the low, cracked ceilings; the waving floor, covered with rag carpet; the <b>sagging</b> <b>doors,</b> and the old-fashioned trim of the small-paned windows, were all very different from the luxurious abundance, the tesselated pavement, and the tapestry Brussels, the lofty studding, and the black walnut mouldings of the St. Albans; and Lemuel felt the difference with a curious mixture of pride and remorse in his own escape from the meanness of his home. He felt the self-reproach to which the man who rises without raising with him all those dear to him is destined in some measure all his life. His interests and associations are separated from theirs, but if he is not an ignoble spirit, the ties of affection remain unweakened; he cares for them with a kind of indignant tenderness, and calls himself to account before them in the midst of pleasures which they cannot share, or even imagine.|$|R
