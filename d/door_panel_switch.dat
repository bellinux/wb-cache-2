5000|$|On March 16, 1999, Lear {{announced}} it would acquire United Technologies Automotive, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation that produced dashboards, electrical distribution systems, motors and air-flow parts, interior <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> and <b>switches,</b> for $2.3 billion. [...] Lear announced on May 4, 1999, that it had completed the acquisition.|$|R
5000|$|The STS {{interior}} had a 12-way power {{front seat}}, manual articulating front seat headrests, center front armrest with cassette and coin/cup storage console trimmed in ultrasoft leather, net-type map pockets, rear bucket seats with integral headrests, center rear console and rear storage compartment, leather-wrapped {{front and rear}} <b>door</b> trim <b>panels,</b> <b>door</b> pull straps and overhead pull straps, high-gloss elm burl real wood appliques on <b>door</b> trim <b>panels</b> and <b>switch</b> plates, horn pad and bar, instrument panel and front and rear consoles, Beechwood Thaxton floor carpet and a decklid liner in tara material with STS logo. Other standard STS features (these were options on the standard Seville) were: automatic door locks, illuminated driver and passenger side visor vanity mirrors, illuminated entry system, rear window defogger, theft-deterrent system and trunk mat.|$|R
2500|$|... 2005 was {{the last}} model year for the XG350, {{as it would be}} {{replaced}} {{at the top of the}} Hyundai line-up by the 2006 Azera. Both the base and L models now offered the formerly optional carpeted floor mats as standard equipment, while the L model was now equipped with a standard trunk-mounted eight-disc CD changer. The driver's <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> <b>panel</b> featured a restyled power door lock button; it was now designed to feel less like the adjacent power window controls, for ease of differentiation by touch.|$|R
2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the <b>door</b> <b>panel,</b> the rear <b>switch</b> being the drivers door window. Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{is presented in}} a two-dimensional cross-section on screen, showing the locations of guards, <b>doors,</b> <b>switch</b> <b>panels,</b> lights, security cameras, and other features, including the target objectives. The player, as Conway, can run and climb on walls, use stairwells and elevators, and using the abilities of Conway's [...] "Bullfrog" [...] hypertrousers, can launch the character great heights or distances, potentially tackling guards or breaking through glass walls. Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player {{to stay out of}} the guards' line of sight.|$|R

50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder of the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> autonomously connecting {{the line to}} a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> defects such as pressure marks and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on <b>door</b> <b>panels.</b> Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks and scratches on <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks and scratches. Pressure marks and scratches emerge at several places on the <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R

50|$|The 1972 {{models were}} {{very similar to the}} 1971 models, with the only change being the rear view mirror was glued to the {{windshield}} rather than bolted to top of the cab, and metal or vinyl-covered flat <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were no longer available; all trim level <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were molded plastic with integral armrests and wood grain inserts on Cheyenne and Sierra trim levels. For restoration, {{it should also be noted}} that the door and window cranks were slightly longer due to the molded plastic <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> and the vent windows were now secured with a single screw on the inside of the door, thus differentiating it from the 1971 model year.|$|R
