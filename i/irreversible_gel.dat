Another dispersion present within balut is an emulsion. Although balut is mainly made up of protein, fat is present within the fertilized bird. An emulsion is a suspension of liquid droplets (fat or water) within a liquid solution (fat or water). The broth found inside balut is a dispersion because of the liquid fat floating within the broth, this can also been seen in chicken broth, in chicken noodle soup. After cooking it can be considered a protein gel (depending on the length of time it was cooked for). Heating foods high in protein such as a chicken egg, or balut, can cause the chemical changes to take place and fully or partially denature proteins, causing the surface to become thick and essentially causing an <b>irreversible</b> <b>gel</b> protein formation to take place.|$|E

Commercial lithium, sodium and potassium silicate solutions were used to reveal the effect of the cation nature on the gelation process. Gels are obtained by acidifying alkaline silicate solutions with hydrochloric acid. A syneresis phenomenon during ripening that leads to the formation of a strongly consolidated solid has been observed. Whatever the cation, the gelation or syneresis mechanism would be similar. However, gelation time decreases and syneresis increases with the cation size. Gelation results from formation of small particles which grow in number and size and then gather to fill the available space. Ripening takes place through a dissolution/precipitation mechanism...|$|E

At the gelation threshold this plateau scales {{as a function of the}} wave vector k as k^η - 2, with η being related to the decay of the percolation pair connectedness function.

40|$|Abstract. We report here a {{calculation}} of the spatial correlation function of the fully polymerised four-functional units in the kinetic gelation model in three dimensions. The {{results indicate that the}} fully polymerised four-functional units form small correlated regions in space. This is in sharp contrast to normal percolation where the spatial distribution of fully polymerised units is uniform. The size of these clusters of crosslinks depends on the extent of reaction, the concentration of initiators and the solvent diffusivity. The results suggest a picture of the microscopic structure of a gel as consisting of bundles of chains linked by clusters of crosslinks in agreement with electron microscopic studies of polyacrylamide gels. The process of free-radical-initiated <b>irreversible</b> polymerisation in <b>gels</b> such as polyacrylamide can be simulated by a kinetic gelation (KG) model originally proposed by Manneville and de Seze (1981) and developed extensively by Herrmann et a 1 (1982).

40|$|Crossflow {{microfiltration}} (0. 1 μm) of {{skimmed milk}} is largely {{used in the}} dairy industry. The overall performance of the process is governed by the accumulation of casein micelles at the membrane surface, {{which leads to the}} formation of an <b>irreversible</b> deposit (a <b>gel)</b> in critical hydrodynamic conditions (CHC). To control the filtration performance, it is then necessary to understand how the micelles accumulate at the membrane and how they interact with each other during accumulation. In that aim, microfiltration of skimmed milks is performed at different ionic strengths (NaCl addition 0 – 0. 3 M) and the properties of the casein micelles deposit are determined in each case in terms of structuration, transmission properties and fouling resistances. Upon addition of salt, our results indicate that the casein micelles turn into a gel at a lower “critical” casein concentration than with native milk. With the increase in ionic strength, the deposit is also more cohesive and harder to remove from the membrane. Finally, the addition of NaCl results in a change in the selectivity of the process, with a decrease in the overall protein transmission through the deposit layer. All these results are explained through a shift in the balance of interactions between and within the micelles as ionic strength is changed. They are also very consistent with the generic colloidal behavior of casein micelles as determined through osmotic stress experiments...|$|R

This makes itinconvenient in transportation, storage, and consumption. Curdlan is a bacterial polysaccharide which is composed mainly of β- 1, 3 - glucosidic linkage. A rigid and elastic thermal <b>irreversible</b> <b>gel</b> could be formed from its suspension by heating above 80 ℃. Excellent gel strength couldbe maintained by the gel after freezing and thawing. The gel would result in syneresis when it is stored, and the syneresis of curdlan gel could bedecreased {{by the addition of}} waxy corn starch. On the other hand, concentration of coagulant required was also affected owing to thebinding capacity of curdlan. Therefore, traditional tofu with freezing resistance and higher water holding capacity was developed in this study. Effects of curdlan(0 ~ 1. 5 %), waxy corn starch(0 ~ 1. 5 %), and coagulantconcentrations(0. 5 ~ 1. 5 %) on traditional tofu were studies by using response surface methodology (RSM) and a three-variable and three-leveldesign. The objectives were to obtain a traditional tofu with freezingresistance by the study of their interactions and by the determination of some optimum conditions. On the other hand, freezing temperature(- 5 ℃ ~- 45 ℃) was combined with those three above-mentioned conditionsin the freeze-drying study in order to develop a dehydrated product with good qualities and to expand the applicability of traditional tofu in modern foods. Items tested included gel strength, water holding capacity,rehydration ratio, Instron texture profile analysis (TPA), as well assensory evaluation and scanning electron microscopic examination. Besides, the studies of pure curdlan was also be performed by using RSM. Differences among those processes was going to be compared and studied,and actions of curdlan in application was going to be further investigatedand elucidated. Results showed that the optimum processing conditions of frozen traditional tofu were curdlan 0 ~ 0. 2 %, waxy corn starch 0. 94 ~ 1. 5 %,and coagulant 1 %. The optimum processing conditions of freeze-dried traditional tofu were found to be curdlan 0 ~ 0. 18 %, waxy corn starch 1. 31 ~ 1. 5 %, coagulant 0. 5 %, and freezing temperature - 25 ℃. 中 文 摘 要 傳統豆腐十分容易腐敗，而且不具抗凍性，冷凍貯藏之 後會形成海棉狀的質地，喪失豆腐特有的質感。因而造成產銷、貯藏及消 費上的許多不便。curdlan是由微生物所產生的一種多醣類，乃是葡萄糖 以β- 1, 3 -醣甘鍵連接而成。其懸浮液在 80 ℃以上加熱可形成堅實、有彈 性之熱不可逆性膠體，此膠體經冷凍、解凍後發現仍能保持良好的凝膠強 度。而糯玉米澱粉的添加可以防止離水。此外，由於curdlan本身就具有 結著性，對豆腐製造時所需的凝結劑添加量會有影響。因此本研究擬將 curdlan與糯玉米澱粉應用於傳統豆腐的製造上，以提高其抗凍性及保水 力，利用反應曲面法(RSM) 對傳統豆腐製程中所用curdlan濃度(0 ~ 1. 5 %) 、糯玉米澱粉濃度(0 ~ 1. 5 %) 及凝結劑濃度(0. 5 ~ 1. 5 %) 進行三因子 三層階的試驗，探討其間的交互作用並進行最適化，嘗試開發具抗凍性的 冷凍傳統豆腐。此外，將前述三因子再配合上預備凍結溫度(- 5 ℃ ~ - 45 ℃) ，進行四因子三層階的試驗，嘗試開發具良好品質的冷凍乾燥豆腐 ，以拓展傳統豆腐在現代化食品中的應用性。測定項目包括凝膠強度、保 水力、復水性及Instron質地輪廓分析(TPA) 等物理分析，以及官能品評和 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察。此外，並以反應曲面法同時對純curdlan的作用 進行探討比較，嘗試藉由相互間的差異來了解curdlan在製造應用中的作 用情形。結果發現冷凍傳統豆腐的最適加工條件為：curdlan濃度 0 ~ 0. 2 %，糯玉米澱粉濃度 0. 94 ~ 1. 5 %，凝結劑濃度 1 %。冷凍乾燥傳統豆腐 的最適加工條件為：curdlan濃度 0 ~ 0. 18 %，糯玉米澱粉濃度 1. 31 ~ 1. 5 %，凝結劑濃度 0. 5 %，預備凍結溫度- 25 ℃...|$|E
40|$|The Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) -encoded p 19 protein (P 19) {{is widely}} used as a robust tool to {{suppress}} RNA interference (RNAi) in various model organisms. P 19 dimers appropriate 21 -nucleotide (nt) duplex short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by Dicer presumably to prevent programming of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In the context of virus infection, this model predicts that P 19 mutants compromised for siRNA binding cannot prevent RISC-mediated degradation of TBSV RNA and thus reduce viral pathogenicity. To test this, we used P 19 / 43 (R→W), which is less pathogenic than wild-type P 19 (wtP 19), and P 19 / 75 - 78 (RR→GG), with pathogenicity properties (i. e., viral spread and symptom induction) {{comparable to those of}} a P 19 -null mutant.

40|$|Glucocerebrosides (GlcCer) {{isolated}} from the leaves of winter rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) differ from the more commonly investigated natural and synthetic cerebrosides, in that greater than 95 % of the fatty acids are saturated and monounsaturated hydroxy fatty acids. Isomers of the trihydroxy long chain base hydroxysphingenine (t 1 (8 : 18 cis or trans)) and isomers of sphingadienine (d 18 : 2 (4 trans, 8 cis or trans)) comprise 77 % and 17 %, respectively, of the total long chain bases. The phase behavior of fully hydrated and dry rye leaf GlcCer was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction. On initial heating, aqueous dispersions of GlcCer exhibit a single endothermic transition at 56 degrees C and have an enthalpy (delta H) of 46 J/g. Cooling to 0 degrees C {{is accompanied by a}} small exothermic transition (delta H = - 8 J/g) at 8 degrees C. On immediate reheating, a broad exothermic transition (delta H = - 39 J/g) is observed between 10 and 20 degrees C in addition to a transition at 56 degrees C. These transitions are not reversible, and the exothermic transition rapidly diminishes when the sample is held at low temperature. Using x-ray diffraction, it was determined that the endotherm at 56 degrees C represents a transition from a highly ordered lamellar crystalline phase (Lc) with a d-spacing of 57 A and a series of wide-angle reflections in the 3 – 10 A range, to a lamellar liquid crystalline (L alpha) phase having a d-spacing of 55 A and a diffuse wide-angle scattering peak centered at 4. 7 A. Cooling leads to the formation of a metastable gel phase (L beta) with a d-spacing of 64. 0 A and a single broad reflection at 4. 28 A. Subsequent warming to above 15 degrees C restores the original Lc phase. Thus, rye GlcCer in excess water exhibit a series of <b>irreversible</b> transitions and <b>gel</b> phase metastability. Dry GlcCer undergo an initial heating endothermic transition at 130 degrees C, which is ascribed to a transformation into the HII phase from a two phase state characterized by the coexistence of phases with disordered (alpha) and helical (delta) type chain conformations but of unknown lattice identity: An exotherm at 67. 5 degrees C observed upon subsequent cooling is of unknown origin. Since an undercooled HII phase persists down to 19 degrees C, the exotherm may derive in part from an alpha-to-delta type chain packing conformational change especially under slow cooling conditions.

40|$|In {{colloidal}} filtration, {{understanding the}} mechanisms responsible for deposit formation and determining {{the relations between}} filtration conditions and deposit characteristics are still major issues. Following the general - and now well admitted - description of colloidal filtration given by Bacchin et al. (2006, 2011), irreversible fouling occurs when a critical concentration in particles is reached at the membrane surface. At this concentration, the interactions between the particles get dominated by attractive forces and phase transition takes place from the liquid to the solid state (<b>irreversible</b> deposit – <b>gel).</b> In cross-flow filtration, this critical concentration is reached at a given flux (this is the well-known concept of critical flux) (Field et al., 1995); while it is reached at a critical filtered volume in dead-end filtrations conducted at constant flux (Bessière et al., 2005). Importantly, phase transition and deposit formation can also be interpreted {{in terms of a}} critical osmotic pressure crit, that can be viewed as the compressive pressure required to reach the critical concentration and go from the liquid to the solid state. The critical conditions for deposit formation, as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the deposit, are now well documented, especially for "hard" colloids like silica, latex, clays [...] .; in opposition to "soft" colloids that can deform and even deswell when concentrated. As the "softness feature" might necessarily {{have an impact on the}} formation of a deposit and on its properties, it becomes essential to get new information about the behavior of soft colloids in filtration. It is all the more important that such soft objects (emulsions, microgels, protein aggregates [...] .) are involved in an increasing number of industrial processes that use membrane operations. In this work, we focus on the behavior of one particular soft and sponge-like natural colloid, the casein micelle that makes up to 80 % of the protein content of cow milk. For that purpose, specific dead-end filtration experiments were designed and performed, involving successive filtrations interspersed with rinse periods at zero transmembrane pressure P = 0). This methodology allowed us to precisely monitor the build-up -or not- of a deposit at the membrane surface, as well as to estimate the critical conditions at which the deposit is formed. A detailed analysis of the properties of the deposit is also proposed, based on the variation in its specific resistance (α) with the conditions of filtration. From the results obtained, we first demonstrate that deposit formation is intimately linked to the colloidal nature of the micelle, as no irreversible deposit is formed when caseins are not organized into micelles. The deposit, or gel, forms through intermicellar bonds that are created when the micelles are forced to come in contact with each other. We then discuss the critical conditions for deposit formation and we estimate the corresponding critical osmotic pressure at which colloidal phase transition occurs. Interestingly, the obtained value is a bit higher than the one measured in "static" osmotic stress experiments; which could be a direct effect of liquid flow between the particles. From our filtration experiments, we find that critical osmotic pressure crit Which corresponds to the compressive pressure that is required to reach the critical concentration and provokes phase transition, equals 31 - 35 kPa. Interestingly, this value is close to the one measured from "static" osmotic stress experiments. It is however sufficiently higher to postulate, among other assumptions, that the liquid flow between the particles and/or the kinetics of intermicellar bond formation have an effect on crit. We finally demonstrate that our results are consistent with a deposit made of closely-packed and connected casein micelles that are compressed during filtration, and that fully relax to their "native" initial dimensions when pressure is released (Figure 1). The deposit is found to be both compressible and relaxable; two properties that are related to the soft and elastic nature of the casein micelle alone. In most cases, the resistance to flow through the deposit is entirely governed by the internal porosity of the casein micelle; this porosity being directly associated to the degree of compression of the micelle body...|$|R
