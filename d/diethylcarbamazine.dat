5000|$|Filariasis; since albendazole's {{disintegration}} of the microfilarie ("pre-larva") can cause an allergic reaction, antihistamines or corticosteroids are sometimes added to treatment. In cases of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi, albendazole is sometimes given {{as an adjunct to}} ivermectin or <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> in order to suppress microfilaremia. It can also be given for loa loa filariasis as an adjunct or replacement to <b>diethylcarbamazine.</b> Albendazole has an embryotoxic effect on Loa loa adults and thus slowly reduces microfilaremia.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis {{involves}} recovering either adult worms {{from the}} arteries {{after the death}} of the infested host, or microcercariae from the skin of the face or head. Treatments have been reported for sheep. A combination of tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate) and emetine hydrochloride healed the skin lesions. [...] For elimination of the nematodes, fuadin (stibophen), <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> and piperazine hexahydrate have been suggested. [...] However, repeated administration of <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> runs the risk of fatality due to accumulation of dead worms in the arteries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC) is a {{medication}} {{used in the}} treatment of filariasis including lymphatic filariasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, and loiasis. It may also be used for prevention of loiasis in those at high risk. While it has been used for onchocerciasis (river blindness), invermectin is preferred. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Treatments for lymphatic {{filariasis}} differ {{depending on the}} geographic location of the endemic area. In sub-Saharan Africa, albendazole is being used with ivermectin to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world, albendazole is used with <b>diethylcarbamazine.</b> Geo-targeting treatments {{is part of a}} larger strategy to eventually eliminate {{lymphatic filariasis}} by 2020.|$|E
50|$|Anthelmintics such as <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> and {{albendazole}} {{have shown}} promise {{in the treatment}} of Brugia timori filariasis.

50|$|<b>Diethylcarbamazine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1947. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is less than 0.01 USD per dose. It is not commercially available in the United States but can be gotten from the Center for Disease Control.|$|E
50|$|High microfilarial loads {{should be}} {{decreased}} by {{a course of}} Ivermectin, a prolonged administration of albendazole, or cytapheresis sessions to prevent occurrence of serious adverse events, including fatal encephalopathy induced by dying microfilariae. Cytapheresis is helpful in decreasing very high microfilarial loads up to 75%. <b>Diethylcarbamazine</b> kills both microfilariae and adult worms but has more severe side effects and can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} {{people outside the}} United States is albendazole combined with ivermectin. A combination of <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> and albendazole is also effective. Side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, and headaches. All of these treatments are microfilaricides; they {{have no effect on}} the adult worms. While the drugs are critical for treatment of the individual, proper hygiene is also required.|$|E
50|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} mass dewormingâ€”treating entire {{groups of}} people who are at risk with a single annual dose of two medicines, namely albendazole in combination with either ivermectin or <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> citrate. With consistent treatment, since the disease needs a human host, the reduction of microfilariae means the disease will not be transmitted, the adult worms will die out, and the cycle will be broken. In sub-Saharan Africa, albendazole (donated by GlaxoSmithKline) is being used with ivermectin (donated by Merck & Co.) to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world, albendazole is used with <b>diethylcarbamazine.</b> Transmission of the infection can be broken when a single dose of these combined oral medicines is consistently maintained annually for a duration of four to six years. Using a combination of treatments better reduces the number of microfilariae in blood. Avoiding mosquito bites, such as by using insecticide-treated mosquito bed nets, also reduces the transmission of lymphatic filariasis.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of loiasis {{involves}} chemotherapy or, in some cases, surgical {{removal of}} adult worms followed by systemic treatment. The current {{drug of choice}} for therapy is <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC), though ivermectin use is not unwarranted. The recommend dosage of DEC is 6 mg/kg/d taken three times daily for 12 days. The pediatric dose is the same. DEC is effective against microfilariae and somewhat effective against macrofilariae (adult worms).|$|E

Subba Rao developed the important anti-cancer drug methotrexate, still in widespread clinical use today, {{and the drug}} <b>Diethylcarbamazine</b> (hetrazan) which was used by WHO against filariasis. Under Subba Rao, Benjamin Duggar made his discovery of the world's first tetracycline antibiotic, aureomycin, in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Visceral toxocariasis {{in humans}} {{can be treated}} with {{antiparasitic}} drugs such as albendazole or mebendazole, tiabendazole or <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> usually in combination with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids have been utilized with some positive results. Anti-helminthic therapy is reserved for severe infections (lungs, brain) because therapy may induce, due to massive larval killing, a strong inflammatory response. Treatment of ocular toxocariasis is more difficult and usually consists of measures to prevent progressive damage to the eye.|$|E
50|$|The Mazzotti reaction, first {{described}} in 1948, {{is a symptom}} complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of onchocerciasis with the medication <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC). Mazzotti reactions can be life-threatening, and are characterized by fever, urticaria, swollen and tender lymph nodes, tachycardia, hypotension, arthralgias, oedema, and abdominal pain that occur within seven days of treatment of microfilariasis. The Mazzotti reaction correlates with intensity of infection; however, there are probably multiple infection intensity-dependent mechanisms responsible for mediating this complex reaction.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on optimal therapeutic approach. The most commonly used drug is <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC), but it is, however, often ineffective. Although other drugs have been tried such as praziquantel, ivermectin, and albendozole, none {{has proven to be}} reliably and rapidly effective. Mebendazole appeared more active than DEC in eliminating the infection, and had comparable overall responses. Thiabendazole evidenced a small, but significant activity against the infection. A combination of treatments, DEC plus mebendazole, was much more effective than single drug doses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diethylcarbamazine</b> {{has been}} shown as an {{effective}} prophylaxis for Loa loa infection.A study of Peace Corps volunteers in the highly Loaâ€”endemic Gabon, for example, had the following results: 6 of 20 individuals in a placebo group contracted the disease, compared to 0 of 16 in the DEC-treated group. Seropositivity for antifilarial IgG antibody was also much higher in the placebo group. The recommended prophylactic dose is 300 mg DEC given orally once weekly. The only associated symptom in the Peace Corps study was nausea.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of streptocerciasis {{includes}} {{the use of}} <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC) which is reportedly effective against the microfilarial and adult stage M. streptocerca, but not proven {{as a method of}} treatment. A common drug used to treat roundworms, Ivermectin, is not proven to serve as a treatment for streptocerciasis although it is shown that ivermectin should not be used as a mass treatment in endemic areas where only M. streptocerca is found. This is because the side effects of the drug commonly outweigh the consequences of the infection.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} coinfection, {{combination}} therapy with ivermectin and <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> is advocated. However coinfection with malaria and HIV, especially among African women, {{does not respond}} well to the current combination therapies.

50|$|Prevention can be {{achieved}} by treating entire groups in which the disease exists, known as mass deworming. This is done every year for about six years, in an effort to rid a population of the disease entirely. Medications used include antiparasitics such as albendazole with ivermectin, or albendazole with <b>diethylcarbamazine.</b> The medications do not kill the adult worms but prevent further spread of the disease until the worms die on their own. Efforts to prevent mosquito bites are also recommended, including reducing the number of mosquitoes and promoting the use of bed nets.|$|E
5000|$|Tropical {{pulmonary}} eosinophilia is a rare, {{but well}} recognised, syndrome characterised by pulmonary interstitial infiltrates and marked peripheral eosinophilia. This condition is more widely recognised and promptly diagnosed in filariasis-endemic regions, {{such as the}} Indian subcontinent, Africa, Asia and South America. In nonendemic countries, patients are commonly thought to have bronchial asthma. Chronic symptoms may delay the diagnosis by up to five years. [...] Early recognition and treatment with the antifilarial drug, <b>diethylcarbamazine,</b> is important, as delay before treatment may lead to progressive interstitial fibrosis and irreversible impairment.|$|E
50|$|An area of {{tremendous}} concern regarding loiasis is its co-endemicity with onchocerciasis {{in certain areas}} of west and central Africa, as mass ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can lead to serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients who have high Loa loa microfilarial densities, or loads. This fact necessitates {{the development of more}} specific diagnostics tests for Loa loa so that areas and individuals at a higher risk for neurologic consequences can be identified prior to microfilaricidal treatment. Additionally, the treatment of choice for loiasis, <b>diethylcarbamazine,</b> can lead to serious complications in and of itself when administered in standard doses to patients with high Loa loa microfilarial loads.|$|E
5000|$|The severe {{symptoms}} {{caused by}} the parasite can be avoided by cleansing the skin, surgery, {{or the use of}} anthelmintic drugs, such as <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> (DEC), ivermectin, or albendazole. The drug of choice is DEC, which can eliminate the microfilariae from the blood and also kill the adult worms with a dosage of 6 mg/kg semiannually or annually. [...] A polytherapy treatment that includes ivermectin with DEC or albendazole is more effective than each drug alone. [...] Protection {{is similar to that of}} other mosquito-spread illnesses; one can use barriers both physical (a mosquito net), chemical (insect repellent), or mass chemotherapy as a method to control the spread of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Antifilarial {{medication}} for infected humans generally is not supported {{in the medical}} literature. One group of authors has recommended a single dose of ivermectin followed by three doses of <b>diethylcarbamazine</b> if the syndrome is recognized prior to surgery. However, most cases are diagnosed retrospectively, when histopathological sections of biopsy or excision material are viewed. In term of surgical care, excision of lesions and affected areas is the treatment of choice for patients with human dirofilariasis. Some authors have recommended a period of observing chest coin lesions for several months if dirofilariasis is suspected and no other features in the history or examination suggesting malignancy or other infection are present. Also, no specific diet is recommended for patients with dirofilariasis.|$|E
