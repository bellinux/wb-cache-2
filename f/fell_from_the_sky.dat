In addition to the blackbirds a few grackles and starlings also <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in the same incident. A test report from the state poultry lab concluded that the birds had died from blunt trauma. An unlicensed fireworks discharge was the likely cause.|$|E

60|$|I <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> on Barbizon {{about two}} o'clock of a September afternoon. It is the dead {{hour of the}} day; all the workers have gone painting, all the idlers strolling, in the forest or the plain; the winding causewayed street is solitary, and the inn deserted. I was the more pleased to find one of my old companions in the dining-room; his town clothes marked him for {{a man in the}} act of departure; and indeed his {{portmanteau}} lay beside him on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Folklore in the British Isles {{suggests}} that Michaelmas {{day is the}} last day that blackberries can be picked.

Satan cursed the fruit, scorched them with his fiery breath, and stamped and spat on them, {{so that they would}} be unfit for eating.

25|$|The {{details of}} Alford’s theory are as follows: that Atlantis was {{a metaphor for}} the primeval underworld (the {{interior}} of the earth); that the invasion of the known world by Atlantis allegorised the eruption of the underworld; and that Ancient Athens represented the ideal city– an archetypal and metaphorical ‘city’ - which <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and defeated Atlantis by breaking into the underworld.|$|E
25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
50|$|The {{limestone}} crags {{are naturally}} arranged {{in the same}} formation as the seven stars of the Big Dipper constellation.

One of the crags can be climbed, having steep stairs going up the side; at the top is a small pavilion for viewing the lake and neighboring crags.

60|$|Paolo {{was entirely}} remote from Maria's world. He {{had not yet}} even grasped the fact of money, not thoroughly. He {{reckoned}} in land and olive trees. So he had the old fatalistic attitude to his circumstances, even to his food. The earth was the Lord's and the fulness thereof; also the leanness thereof. Paolo could only do his part and leave the rest. If he ate in plenty, having oil and wine and sausage in the house, and plenty of maize-meal, he was glad with the Lord. If he ate meagrely, of poor polenta, that was fate, it was <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> that ruled these things, and no man ruled <b>the</b> <b>skies.</b> He took his fate as it <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies.</b>|$|R

Mulder, assisted on the case by Mexican-American INS agent Conrad Lozano, is able to track down and interrogate Eladio, who frightens the other migrants. Meanwhile, Scully discovers that Maria was killed by a fungal growth known as Aspergillus.|$|E

50|$|Wind {{continued}} to blow throughout {{the afternoon and}} evening. Swamp coolers were blown off the roofs of buildings. Windows were shattering and store signs were blowing in the wind.

60|$|Nor was {{the village}} less {{attractive}} in its sounds {{than in the}} natural pleasing disorder of its aspect and the sheltering warmth of its street. In the fields and by the skimpy hedges perfect silence reigned; only the wind blowing in your face filled your ears with a rushing aerial sound like that which lives in a seashell. Coming back from this open bleak silent world, the village street seemed vocal with bird voices. For the birds, too, loved the shelter which had enabled them to live through that great frost; and they were now recovering their voices; and whenever the wind lulled and a gleam of sunshine <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>sky,</b> they were singing {{from end to end}} of the long street.|$|R

Then she knew there was a hand in her hand, though she saw nobody, and the hand seemed to lead her on. And she came to an open place in the forest, and there the silver light <b>fell</b> clear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and she saw a great shadowy rose tree, covered with white wild roses.|$|R
2500|$|Whereas the {{original}} game was primarily {{inspired by a}} real life experience Boakes had, Lights Out featured {{a larger number of}} influences. The main inspirations for the game were the still-unexplained disappearance of three lighthouse keepers from the Flannan Isles Lighthouse in December 1900, and [...] "The Ballad of Flannan Isle" [...] (1912) by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, which was inspired by the incident, and which features several times in the game itself. Another major influence on both the story and the look of the game was the 1977 Doctor Who serial Horror of Fang Rock, which itself was partly inspired by the Flannan Isles disappearances, and which sees the Fourth Doctor investigate why a lighthouse on the island of Fang Rock is not lit, finding one lighthouse keeper dead, and the others reporting a light <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> near the island.|$|E
2500|$|This {{culminated in}} the Chiapas [...] "caste war", which was an {{uprising}} the Tzotzils beginning in 1868. The basis of the uprising was {{the establishment of the}} [...] "three stones cult" [...] in Tzajahemal. Agustina Gómez Checheb was a girl tending her father’s sheep when three stones <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Collecting them, she put them on her father’s altar and soon claimed that the stone communicated with her. Word of this soon spread and the [...] "talking stones" [...] of Tzajahemel soon became a local indigenous pilgrimage site. The cult was taken over by one pilgrim, Pedro Díaz Cuzcat, who also claimed to be able to communicate with the stones, and had knowledge of Catholic ritual, becoming a kind of priest. However, this challenged the traditional Catholic faith and non Indians began to denounce the cult. Stories about the cult include embellishments such as the crucifixion of a young Indian boy.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1666 two {{fishermen}} {{caught a}} huge female shark {{near the town}} of Livorno, and Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, ordered its head to be sent to Steno. Steno dissected the head and published his findings in 1667. He noted that the shark's teeth bore a striking resemblance to certain stony objects, found embedded within rock formations, that his learned contemporaries were calling glossopetrae or [...] "tongue stones". Ancient authorities, such as the Roman author Pliny the Elder, in his Naturalis Historia, had suggested that these stones <b>fell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> or from the Moon. Others were of the opinion, also following ancient authors, that fossils naturally grew in the rocks. Steno's contemporary Athanasius Kircher, for example, attributed fossils to a [...] "lapidifying virtue diffused through the whole body of the geocosm", considered an inherent characteristic of the earth – an Aristotelian approach. Fabio Colonna, however, had already shown in a convincing way that glossopetrae are shark teeth, in his treatise De glossopetris dissertatio published in 1616. Steno added to Colonna's theory a discussion on the differences in composition between glossopetrae and living sharks' teeth, arguing that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form, using the contemporary corpuscular theory of matter.|$|E
50|$|Pido (Rene Requiestas) and Dida (Kris Aquino) grew up {{together}} in an orphanage believing they are siblings. Soon after a family adopts both of them, they leave the house due to abuse.

The moment that their parents found them and they discover {{that they are not}} related, their feelings for each other get stronger. They are now separated from each other, however, with Pido working as a street vendor and Dida living in a mansion. Despite their differences, they still choose to love each other and they get married in the end.

Following his father's trail, Lemeza comes to the ruins and discovers it's composed of various amalgamations of various ruins and structures from different areas around the globe. Upon further exploration and discovery within the ruins, Lemeza learns the story about how a being simply known as [...] "Mother" [...] <b>fell</b> down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and crashed onto the planet.

And it could be nothing else but either that or Cayenne. I've got my wits about me. Directly I sighted this queer game I said to myself--'Escaped Convict.' I was as certain of it as I am of seeing you standing here this minute. So I spurred on straight at him. He stood his ground for a bit on a sand hillock crying out: 'Monsieur! Monsieur! Arretez!' then at the last moment broke and ran for life. Says I to myself, 'I'll tame you before I'm done with you.' So without a single word I kept on, heading him off here and there. I rounded him up towards the shore, and at last I had him corralled on a spit, his heels in the water and nothing but sea and sky at his back, with my horse pawing the sand and shaking his head within a yard of him.|$|R
