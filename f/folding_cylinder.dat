40|$|Origami <b>folded</b> <b>cylinders</b> (origami bellows) {{have found}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated applications in space flight and medicine. In {{spite of this}} interest, a general understanding of the mechanics of an origami <b>folded</b> <b>cylinder</b> has been elusive. With a newly developed set of geometrical tools, we have found an analytic solution for all possible cylindrical rigid-face states of both Miura-ori and triangular tessellations. Although an idealized bellows {{in both of these}} families may have two allowed rigid-face configurations over a well-defined region, the corresponding physical device, limited by nonzero material thickness and forced to balance hinge and plate-bending energy, often cannot stably maintain a stowed configuration. We have identified the parameters that control this emergent bistability, and have demonstrated the ability to design and fabricate bellows with tunable deployability.

40|$|Some {{specially}} designed materials exhibit a transverse expansion when stretched. This behaviour {{can be described}} by a negative Poisson’s ratio, υ, that is commonly defined as the ratio between the negative transverse strain and the longitudinal strain. Some polymers found by Lake [1] have such property. In a separate paper, Lake showed a 2 d version of the micro-structure of the materials consisting of honeycomb with inverted cells and the possible conversion to 3 d structure with inwardly bulging cells. In this paper, we report that the same technique {{can be used in}} origami to create expandable tubes with negative Poisson’s ratio based on folding patterns for flat paper and their application as deployable stents in medicine. Many folding patterns for flat paper could lead to an overall negative Poisson’s ratio. Typical examples include some map folding patterns and the well-known Miura-ori in which the pulling of the diagonal corners of a folded paper will lead to expansion of the other two corners. Through out-of-plane motion the folded flat paper can expand or contract in two orthogonal directions simultaneously. Some of the folding patterns for flat paper can also used for <b>folding</b> of <b>cylinders.</b> Fujimoto (藤 本 修 三) first explored this possibility. In his book published in 1982 [2], he presented numerous folding patterns for flat paper and their transformation to tubes by joining together two edges of the paper. The similar concepts have also reported by other authors[3]. The reported work primarily focuses on the artistic aspect of the <b>folding</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Most of the patterns, including the one based on Miura-ori, result cylinders which are completed rigid or have little expansion, nevertheless, a few patterns enable the diameter of the tubes to alter...|$|R
40|$|Summary. p 2 p 2 is {{an upgrade}} of the continuation/bifurcation package pde 2 path for {{elliptic}} systems of PDEs, based on Matlab’s pdetoolbox. The new features include easier switching between different single parameter continuations, genuine multi–parameter continuation (e. g., <b>fold</b> continuation), <b>cylinder</b> and torus geometries (i. e., periodic boundary conditions), a general interface for adding auxiliary equations like mass conservation or phase equations for continuation of traveling waves, {{and a more}} efficient FEM usage.

40|$|Trapped singly-charged ions can {{crystallize}} as {{a result}} of laser cooling. The emerging structure depends on the number of particles and on the geometry of the trapping potential. In linear multipole radiofrequency traps, the geometry of the radial potential can lead to the formation of single-ring structures. We analyse the conditions and stability of single rings {{as a function of the}} number of poles. For larger numbers of ions the rings form tubes in which the arrangement of the ions corresponds to a triangular lattice <b>folded</b> onto a <b>cylinder.</b> The stability of these tubular structures is numerically studied for different lattice constants and their normal mode spectrum is determined.

40|$|We {{study the}} lateral {{deformations}} of randomly folded elastoplastic and predominantly plastic thin sheets under the uniaxial and radial compressions. We {{found that the}} lateral deformations of <b>cylinders</b> <b>folded</b> from elastoplastic sheets of paper obey a power law behavior with the universal Poissons index nu = 0. 17 pm 0. 01, which does not depend neither the paper kind and sheet sizes, nor the folding confinement ratio. In contrast to this, the lateral deformations of randomly folded predominantly plastic aluminum foils display the linear dependence on the axial compression with the universal Poissons ratio nu_e = 0. 33 pm 0. 01. This difference {{is consistent with the}} difference in fractal topology of randomly folded elastoplastic and predominantly plastic sheets, which is found to belong to different universality classes. The general form of constitutive stress-deformation relations for randomly folded elastoplastic sheets is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of the transdermal {{penetration}} of different active agents {{is an important}} research goal. Our aim was to establish a novel in vivo experimental model which provides a possibility for exact measurement of the quantity of penetrated drug. The experiments were performed on SKH- 1 hairless mice. A skin fold in the dorsal region was fixed with two fenestrated titanium plates. A circular wound was made {{on one side of}} the skin <b>fold.</b> A metal <b>cylinder</b> with phosphate buffer was fixed into the window of the titanium plate.

40|$|The studied {{bump stop}} is a hollow <b>folded</b> {{polyurethane}} <b>cylinder</b> mounted around the damper rod in a MacPherson front wheel suspension, restricting the upward wheel displacement. It {{is a critical}} component for durability since the force transfer through the bump stop determines the vertical peak loads to the car body. In extreme load cases as driving over a curb, the bump stop is subjected to impact loading giving a highly non-linear behavior. The nominal compressive strain can reach 80 % under a load duration of milliseconds. The presented model is based on impact test data. By performing drop tests, high load levels and short contact times can be combined, giving a realistic loading in view of road load data from the test track. The main objective of the model is to predict the behavior at high strain rates and strain levels. The strongly progressive behavior, shown in a stress strain diagram, {{both in terms of}} the loading curve and the hysteresis, requires special attention. The main feature of the model is a linear viscoelastic Maxwell model combined with a function that takes care of the strongly progressive behavior. This function, obtained from a dynamic loading curve in the impact test, is multiplied with the Maxwell stress, giving the sought progressive behavior. The model is accurate, simple to obtain from the impact test, computationally efficient, and easy to implement in commercial multi-body-system codes as ADAMS and can thus successfully be used in the product development of new cars...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSignal {{transduction}} ATPases {{with numerous}} domains (STAND) are sophisticated proteins that integrate several signals and respond by building multimeric platforms allowing signaling in various processes: apoptosis, innate immunity, bacterial metabolism. They comprise a conserved nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD), which {{functions as a}} binary switch that oscillates between the OFF (ADP-bound) and the ON (ATP-bound) conformation, and non conserved sensor and effector domains. Transition from the OFF form to the ON form strictly depends on the binding of an inducer to the sensor domain. The interaction of the inducer with this domain was studied in MalT, a model STAND protein. MalT sensor domain has a SUPR (superhelical repeats) <b>fold</b> resembling a <b>cylinder</b> with a central cavity. The cavity was subjected to an alanine-scanning approach, {{and the effects of}} the alanine substitutions on inducer binding and transcription activation were analyzed. This work unambiguously showed that the inducer maltotriose binds inside the cavity, and a patch on the inner surface was proposed to be the primary maltotriose binding-site. Furthermore, limited proteolysis suggested that maltotriose binding changes the conformation of the sensor domain...|$|R

40|$|Leaves {{and flowers}} {{frequently}} have a characteristic rippling pattern at their edges. Recent experiments found similar patterns in torn plastic. These patterns can be reproduced by imposing metrics upon thin sheets. The {{goal of this}} paper is to discuss a collection of analytical and numerical results for the shape of a sheet with a non [...] flat metric. First, a simple condition is found to determine when a stretched sheet <b>folded</b> into a <b>cylinder</b> loses axial symmetry, and buckles like a flower. General expressions are next found for the energy of stretched sheet, both in forms suitable for numerical investigation, and for analytical studies in the continuum. The bulk of the paper focuses upon long thin strips of material with a linear gradient in metric. In some special cases, the energy [...] minimizing shapes of such strips can be determined analytically. Euler [...] Lagrange equations are found which determine the shapes in general. The paper closes with numerical investigations of these equations. Comment: 15 pages and 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} contact conductance {{between two}} mating surfaces, a conductive tape {{has been developed}} by growing dense arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs, graphite layers <b>folded</b> into <b>cylinders)</b> {{on both sides of}} a thermally conductive metallic foil. When the two mating surfaces are brought into contact with the conductive tape in between, the CNT arrays will adhere to the mating surface. The van der Waals force between the contacting tubes and the mating surface provides adhesion between the two mating surfaces. Even though the thermal contact conductance of a single tube-to-tube contact is small, the tremendous amount of CNTs on the surface leads to a very large overall contact conductance. Interface contact thermal resistance rises from the microroughness and the macroscopic non-planar quality of mating surfaces. When two surfaces come into contact with each other, the actual contact area may be much less than the total area of the surfaces. The real area of contact depends on the load, the surface roughness, and the elastic and inelastic properties of the surface. This issue is even more important at cryogenic temperatures, where materials become hard and brittle and vacuum is used, which prevents any gas conduction through the interstitial region. A typical approach to increase thermal contact conductance is to use thermally conducting epoxies or greases, which are not always compatible with vacuum conditions. In addition, the thermal conductivities of these compounds are often relatively low. The CNTs used in this approach can be metallic or semiconducting, depending on the folding angle and diameter. The electrical resistivity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been reported. MWCNTs can pass a current density and remain stable at high temperatures in air. The thermal conductivity of a MWCNT at room temperature is measured to be approximately 3, 000 W/m-K, which is much larger than that of diamond. At room temperature, the thermal conductance of a 0. 3 sq cm array of CNTs was measured to be as high as 10 W/K. The high thermal conductivity and the nanoscale size make CNTs ideal as thermal interface materials. The CNT-based thermal tape can be used for the thermal management of microelectronic packages and electronic systems. It also can be integrated with current device technology and packaging. The material would allow for an efficient method to manage excess heat generation without requiring any additional power. Lastly, the CNT tape can be used to enhance thermal contact conductance across two mating surfaces on some NASA missions...|$|R
