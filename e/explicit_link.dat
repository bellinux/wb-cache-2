25|$|Camel case {{is used in}} some wiki markup {{languages}} for {{terms that}} should be automatically linked to other wiki pages. This convention was originally used in Ward Cunningham's original wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as TiddlyWiki, Trac and PmWiki make use {{of it in the}} default settings, but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or plugin to disable it. Wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> markup using square brackets and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as AboutUs.|$|E

2500|$|The Celtic {{languages}} (usually pronounced [...] {{but sometimes}} [...] ) are descended from Proto-Celtic, or [...] "Common Celtic"; {{a branch of}} the greater Indo-European language family. The term [...] "Celtic" [...] was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, following Paul-Yves Pezron who had already made the <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.|$|E
30|$|The {{distance}} between two objects depends {{not only on}} the number of links existing in the navigation path between the pages, but also on the type of HTML constructs (i.e., tags) that make up the links. We distinguish tags that must be explicitly clicked by the user (<b>explicit</b> <b>links)</b> from tags that refer to objects that are automatically loaded when the requested page is parsed (implicit <b>links).</b> Regarding <b>explicit</b> <b>links,</b> our system considers only the a HTML tag. A link in the navigation path referring to this tag is assigned a distance of 1, since traversing this link requires the user to follow the link, which is not guaranteed to happen.|$|R
40|$|WS-BPEL is a {{standard}} language to model business processes. Control flow is modeled explicitly using links. Data is passed via shared variables {{and there is no}} notion of <b>explicit</b> data <b>links.</b> However, <b>explicit</b> data <b>links</b> are an important means to reason about business process models. We present an algorithm to derive <b>explicit</b> data <b>links</b> in WS-BPEL processes. By considering dead path elimination as defined in WS-BPEL, we reduce the number of derived data links when compared to existing approaches that ignore dead path elimination...|$|R
40|$|Online {{newspapers}} and journals, {{as well as}} many other types of informational sites, are invariably confronted with the question of where to place links associated with the online document. Currently, many informational sites place associative links below (as seen with CNN. com) or {{on the side of the}} document (as seen with techreview. com), while a shrinking number of sites embed associative links within their documents, such as scientificamerican. com. Placing associative links either outside or within a document has both benefits and drawbacks. The placement of links outside of a document (<b>explicit</b> <b>links)</b> may promote quicker selection times once the context of the link is known, since the reader does not have to wade through the entire document to find the link. Moreover, readers exposed to <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> may be less prone to digress to other information paths before completely reading and grasping the meaning of the entire document. If digression does occur, then information may be retrieved faster with <b>explicit</b> <b>links.</b> On the other hand, embedding the links may provide an important context that would be absent if they stood outside of a document. It also may provide for a stronger association between the main document and the secondary, associative pages. Unfortunately, there has been very little empirically validated research concerning associative lin...|$|R
2500|$|... The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} transport, as {{an application of}} sustainability to transport, originally grew out of concerns to minimise the harmful environmental effects associated with our increasing use of transport (particularly automobiles). [...] However, the concept has evolved to require a more <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> to {{the achievement of the}} triple bottom line, rather than purely addressing environmental concerns, in the context of transport. [...] In other words, the goal of sustainable transport needs to express how transport integrates, influences and affects broader social, economic and environmental outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst British Labour MP Keith Vaz {{argued that}} Bully be banned or {{reclassified}} as rated 18 in the UK before its publication, {{the game was}} released rated 15. Currys and PC World, both owned by DSG International, {{said that they did}} not wish to sell the game in the UK because it is [...] "not appropriate for Currys' family-friendly image". The official statement lists what Currys believes is [...] "the <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between violence and children" [...] as the reason behind the ban. Despite this decision, other high street retailers including Game, HMV and Virgin Megastores announced intentions to stock the game. DSG stores still stock other Rockstar games including the GTA series, and other violent games like Manhunt, which both have BBFC 18 ratings, whereas Bully has a BBFC 15 rating.|$|E

30|$|First, {{we focus}} on {{traceability}} links among different kinds of software engineering artifacts. Managing <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> among different artifacts is a normal idea.

50|$|Stevens 1961 paper {{used the}} linear {{programming}} {{version of the}} transportation, assignment, translocation of masses problem of Koopmans, Hitchcock, and Kantorovich. His analysis provided an <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between transportation and location rent. It was quite transparent, {{and it can be}} extended simply. In response to the initiation of the P-J study, Herbert and Stevens (1960) developed the core model of the P-J Study. Note that this paper was published before the 1961 paper. Even so, the 1961 paper came first in Stevens’ thinking.|$|E

50|$|Another {{concept for}} Scotland {{becoming}} a republic is through {{reform of the}} United Kingdom's constitutional status from a constitutional monarchy to a republican constitution. There is not an <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> with British unionism, as this tends to advocate the Union of Crowns. This {{is a form of}} British republicanism which is supported by many English politicians such as Dennis Skinner and Jeremy Corbyn, and advocacy groups such as Republic. There is not mainstream support for this concept in any Scottish political parties, and remains a personal position, unlike support for an independent Scottish republic which does have party support.|$|E
50|$|Cloning {{refers to}} a process whereby a new object is {{constructed}} by copying the behavior of an existing object (its prototype). The new object then carries all the qualities of the original. From this point on, the new object can be modified. In some systems the resulting child object maintains an <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> (via delegation or resemblance) to its prototype, {{and changes in the}} prototype cause corresponding changes to be apparent in its clone. Other systems, such as the Forth-like programming language Kevo, do not propagate change from the prototype in this fashion, and instead follow a more concatenative model where changes in cloned objects do not automatically propagate across descendants.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{the idea}} of rapid climate change caused by {{disruption}} of North Atlantic Ocean currents creates the setting for the 2004 apocalyptic science-fiction film The Day After Tomorrow.

50|$|At {{least one}} paper {{has made an}} <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between OCPD and the OCD {{symptoms}} endorsed by anorexics, noticing that in the samples under study one with both restrictive anorexia and OCD and another from OCD but no present eating disorder those with comorbid AN and OCD {{were more likely to}} be diagnosed with OCPD than those with OCD only (38.1% vs 8.7%). In a larger sample which included anorexic bingers and normal weight bulimics, it was found that all three eating disordered groups were more likely to develop symptoms about order and symmetry than the OCD-only group. Among women recovered from AN, orderliness concerns remain higher than among control samples without an eating disorder history.|$|E

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of Richard Walsh is notable because it established an <b>explicit</b> <b>link</b> between Mavis and the Sydney satirical magazine Oz, which {{at that time}} {{was the subject of a}} highly publicized censorship controversy. The three Oz co-editors—Walsh, Richard Neville and Martin Sharp - had recently been charged with producing an obscene publication, relating to satirical articles and photographs published in the magazine's early editions. In September 1964 the trio was found guilty of the obscenity charges, and there was a major public outcry when presiding magistrate Gerald Locke SM sentenced Walsh and Neville to six months' imprisonment with hard labour. When Mavis premiered the [...] "Oz Three" [...] were preparing their appeal against the verdict (which was ultimately quashed).|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Web-page {{classification}} can be enhanced by using hyperlinks that provide linkages between Web pages. However, in the Web space, hyperlinks are usually sparse, noisy and thus in many situations can only provide limited help in classification. In this paper, we extend the concept of linkages from explicit hyperlinks to implicit links built between Web pages. By observing that people who search the Web with the same queries often click on di#erent, but related documents together, we draw implicit links between Web pages that are clicked after the same queries. Those pages are implicitly linked. We provide an approach for automatically building the implicit links between Web pages using Web query logs, together with a thorough comparison between the uses of implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> in Web page classification. Our experimental results on a large dataset confirm that the use of the implicit links is better than using <b>explicit</b> <b>links</b> in classification performance, with an increase of more than 10. 5 % in terms of the Macro-F 1 measurement...|$|R
