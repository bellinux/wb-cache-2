Substation consists of 2 <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders,</b> 2 outgoing feeders for motors, 2 outgoing feeders for power transformers, measuring, bus coupler and bus riser <b>feeder.</b> <b>Incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> are connected to distribution system E. ON by cable lines which were proposed. Protected machines (power transformers and motors with rated power) are connected to switchgear panels of UniGear ZS 1 type by cable lines too. Proposed protection system {{is based on the}} short-circuit conditions, standard CSN 33 3051 recommendations as well as theoretical backgrounds acquired from technical papers and other publicated literature according to the bibliography. For selected protection functions are defined their parameters. Control, monitoring and protection functions provides REF 542 plus relay. Consequently, secondary tests which are part of the commissioning, are given in the practical part of thesis. Secondary tests were performed by relay test system FREJA 300 by Megger. Results of tests are displayed in tripping characteristics...|$|R

The smart meter measurements were aggregated {{to construct the}} load profiles of the loads connected to an 11 kV transformer. These load profiles were used to decide the period during which an agent reconfigures the network to minimise outage times. The proposed approach was exemplified using a 11 kV network having two <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> and a backup generator...|$|R
40|$|Managing newly {{received}} cattle presents {{challenges from}} both a nutritional and health standpoint; however, information about pre-arrival management of <b>incoming</b> <b>feeder</b> cattle {{has become increasingly}} available and can be utilized to refine arrival processing protocols. Previous management, nutrition and vaccination history impacts newly arrived cattle’s capabilities of coping with the stress associated with feedlot entry. Utilizing the available information to more precisely identify the diseaserisk of incoming groups of cattle will assist in determining expected investments in disease prevention and intervention {{as well as the}} associated labor involved...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the problem of flow collision of the integrative information transmission in the switched Ethernet for substation process-level (SESPL), this paper proposed a novel priority-based transfer scheme in the end-nodes {{based on the information}} model, in which different priorities are assigned according to different information types by using the user priority field defined in the standard IEEE 802. 1, and first-come-first-served (FCFS) and static priority queuing (SPQ) scheduling algorithms are used in the switch and end-nodes respectively. An implementation method through introducing a prioritization mechanism into the protocol stacks is presented. Case study on a typical substation <b>feeder</b> <b>bay</b> verifies the validity and feasibility of the proposed schemer...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{protection}} concept for medium voltage substation. The first theoretical part of thesis describes given medium voltage substation. Substation consists of two <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> and six outgoing feeders. Due {{to the size of the}} substation was selected one outgoing feeder which is the subject of description and protection concept. Next part of the thesis is a description of the protective functions used to protect the elements in the selected feeder. This part contains a detailed description of the function and setting options for protection. The main part of the thesis describes calculation of specific protection functions and consequently with secondary testing of protective functions.

40|$|The thesis titled Individual {{stand-by}} of <b>incoming</b> <b>feeder</b> of Energetika Třinec 6 kV substantion is theoreticaly {{and practically}} concived work that offers comprehensive information on automatic standby {{focused on the}} selected operation of Energetika Třinec. At present, the standby is in authention mode and thesis solves shutdown of transformer T 5. The extract of automatic device indicates trouble-free operation and thesis focus on the power take-off for transformer T 5. The theoretical part provides information about problems of own comsumption of power plants, automatic device of standby and protection of electrical equipment. Thesis also sloves the protection settings, which is supported by calculations of short-circuit currents. The practical part is formed from the suggestion of solution in accordance to current criteria and the evaluation of possible settings of protective automatic devices together with an assessment of implementation option of standby. The aim of the thesis is to perform analysis of standby and evaluate effects which causes shutdown of own comsumption part.

40|$|Performance and carcass {{data from}} 624 steers in three {{experiments}} {{were used to}} evaluate potential strategies that might be used with <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> to remove animals that produce low value carcasses when cattle are sold in a valuebased grid. Removing 10 % of the carcasses with the lowest net value from each group increased the overall average net value of the remaining carcasses $ 17. 50 to $ 21. 09. Carcass weight {{was found to be}} the most significant factor determining net value of the carcass. Gain of the steers during the first 3 to 5 weeks of the feeding period was significantly related to average final gain and carcass value, but accounted for {{a small portion of the}} overall variation in gain or carcass value. Use of initial gain was successful in identifying ten of the sixty-four carcasses with least net value in a value-based grid. Adding frame score and measurement of initial thickness of backfat along with initial gain did not significantly improve identification of the low-value carcasses. Sorting the steers as feeders based on frame score and initial thickness of backfat resulted in differences in performance and carcass measurements. The low-value carcasses tended to be concentrated in the smaller-framed steers...|$|R
40|$|Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) {{systems are}} a widely applied, low cost {{electrification}} method {{used in many}} rural areas. In Central Queensland a single SWER system supplying approximately 100 kW may extend more than 300 km. Many SWER systems include shunt reactors to control {{the effects of the}} line charging capacitance. One effect, the Ferranti effect, causes the line voltage to rise with the distance. In three phase distribution systems this effect is not visible but in SWER systems, this effect makes it difficult to maintain the consumers supply within the acceptable regulation range. As the second effect, the loading of the SWER system supply transformer increases. Controllable shunt reactors are used as one solution to the aforementioned problems. Stanage <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder</b> in Central Queensland area has been chosen for the installation of the designed shunt reactor. Stange <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder</b> is supplied by an isolating transformer with the total capacity of 150 kVA and the voltage level of 22 kV. Using the Stanage <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder,</b> this paper details the process of design and simulation of a suitable switch reactor. This step has been carried out by firstly, the design of the switch reactor and secondly, the proper modelling of the designed reactor for the voltage regulation studies...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{through the}} Transport Coordination Board, Union Airways with its commercially strong backing blocked and {{continued}} to block the other airline, Great Pacific, from landing at Palmerston North leaving the Gisborne-Hawkes <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder</b> airlines with a restricted service. Their passengers would have to travel north by rail. Union Airways under their postal contract collected mail from the overnight Limited Express train at Palmerston {{and took it to}} the South Island and required no air link to Auckland. The board [...] "caused perturbation" [...] in the North Island by noting the most important trunk route would be between Palmerston North and Dunedin. Later newspapers produced articles about the working time saved by an Auckland businessman heading for Christchurch and travelling to Palmerston North by overnight train when compared with a flight originating in Auckland the following morning which would land him in Christchurch much later that day.|$|R
40|$|Substations (HV/MV) connect {{transmission}} and distribution systems with consumers of electric energy. The selective search method was used for calculation of substation reliability, where all arrangement elements were grouped into blocks. Subject of the analysis was H-arrangements comprising air-insulated switchgears on the high voltage side of HV/MV substations with different number of <b>feeder</b> and transformer <b>bays</b> and diverse scope of the installed switching equipment. Failure rate and duration were used as main HV/MV substation equipment reliability indices. A large number of arrangements were classified into groups, and within a group the arrangements were ranked {{with the use of}} multiple criteria. It is shown that the reliability of the electricity transit depends on the equipment of field for the transit of electricity, which favors poorly equipped field. On the other hand, the reliability of transformation of the full power depends mostly on the equipment in coupling field. It is essential that in the coupling field, {{there are at least two}} disconnectors. Installation of the switch in the coupling field is meaningful only with appropriate protection, because it further improves reliability. Conclusions are drawn for phased construction and expansion of the single pole diagram with an additional field for the transmission line...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{an urgent}} need for an {{international}} protocol for power protection and substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) agreed to collaborate together to advance the existing communication protocols for substation automation system (SAS). The objectives were to achieve interoperability and free configuration in a multi-vendor environment substation. The outcome of this agreement was to announce {{the first edition of}} the IEC 61850 Standard as an international standard in 2004. The standard incorporates the use of logical nodes to resolve problems related to interoperability and interchangeability in multi-vendor zone substation systems. The standard also initiated a cost-effective Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging technology to replace the traditional copper wiring. The second edition of the IEC 61850 Standard was published in 2014 which is encapsulated in a series of 20 documents spanning over ten sections. The last few years has seen numerous studies pointing to the IEC 61850 as a worthwhile international standard for substation automation system. There is still, nevertheless, resistance from utilities to welcoming the IEC 61850 implementation. This may perhaps be {{due to the lack of}} knowledge that engineers have about the standard and/or because of several ambiguous topics that still are not addressed in detail in the context of IEC 61850. Furthermore, it should go without saying that, the GOOSE technology has brought several benefits to the power protection and communication systems in the field of substation automation. However, the lack of tools and knowledge to take advantage of the GOOSE messaging technology in IEC 61850 -based zone substations is tangible. For instance, in order to test an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), isolating a GOOSE message from substation is a main industrial challenge for engineers. When an IED is isolated from live substation for test purposes, its GOOSE message is not isolated yet, and the IED under test is still publishing the GOOSE trip signal to other IEDs. In order to isolate the GOOSE trip signal for IED test purposes, each vendor implements its own method and they use their proprietary configurator tools. This means that, engineers are desperately dealing with a lack of comprehensive tool or method to isolate the GOOSE trip signal in a multi-vendor zone substation. These challenges led to the slow migration of the standard into substations. Having acknowledged these difficulties and challenges the spotlight is seemingly in the path of developing a tool or program to be utilised for GOOSE isolation and GOOSE management in a multi-vendor relay environment. In doing that, a 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation is implemented accompanied with a SCADA centre as a model of an IEC 61850 -based Substation. Two bays with separate 66 kV sub-transmission lines, 66 / 22 kV step down transformers, 22 kV Bus 1 with Bus Tie Circuit Breaker and three 22 kV <b>feeders</b> per <b>bay</b> have been considered for the simulation. In the construction of the Substation Simulator, the aim is to take advantage of the IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging technology for protection, control, monitoring and communication purposes. Hence, the hardwire connections are replaced by GOOSE signals through optic cables as much as possible. This thesis will not only provide the design and configuration procedures of this substation, but also will cover the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance. In order to fully understand the concept of the 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation, it is very essential to be familiar with the structure of communication protocols and the IEC 61850 Standard. This thesis starts by exploring a synopsis of communication protocols and their development over the time. It elucidates core elements of telemetry communications, structures of protocols and the significance of standards for communication protocols within substation automation systems. This is followed by a comprehensive exploration of the fundamentals of the IEC 61850 -based substations. In particular, it will cover the GOOSE messaging technology and interoperability in a multi-vendor substation environment. The author also addresses the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance...|$|R
