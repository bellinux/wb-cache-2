On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and with a faint pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E

5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in Geneva.

His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E

5|$|Domestic mammals form a {{large part}} of the {{livestock}} raised for meat across the world. They include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep, 1 billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.|$|E
5|$|Economically, animals {{provide much}} of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of {{mechanised}} transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of}} the power used <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and transport.
