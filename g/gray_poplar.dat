5000|$|The Trysting Tree at Oregon State University, in the USA, {{was a large}} <b>Gray</b> <b>Poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) located {{southeast}} of Benton Hall, and was a popular gathering spot on campus. According to one story, George Coote, a faculty member in Horticulture, planted the tree between 1880 and 1885. An early alumnus claimed that the Trysting Tree was so named because of its [...] "magical effects on students, especially in springtime". The tree's popularity was such that the Board of Regents felt obliged to place two arc lights on the cupola of Benton Hall (then the administration building) [...] "to keep the tree from being overworked". On September 27, 1987, the original Trysting Tree was cut down because of advanced disease in its trunk and limbs. Prior to its removal, Jack Stang (Department of Horticulture) took several cuttings from the tree and rooted them. One these [...] "offshoots" [...] (Trysting Tree II) was planted in 1982 near the original tree.|$|E
40|$|The plastidic 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol- 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pathways in plants andproduces a large variety of essential isoprenoids. Its regulation, however, is still not well understood. Using the stableisotope 13 C-labeling technique, we analyzed the carbon fluxes through the MEP pathway and into the major plastidicisoprenoid products in isoprene-emitting and transgenic isoprene-nonemitting (NE) <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus 3 canescens). Weassessed the dependence on temperature, light intensity, and atmospheric [CO 2]. Isoprene biosynthesis was by far (99 %) themain carbon sink of MEP pathway intermediates in mature <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> leaves, and its production required severalfold highercarbon fluxes compared with NE leaves with almost zero isoprene emission. To compensate for the much lower demand forcarbon, NE leaves drastically reduced the overall carbon flux within the MEP pathway. Feedback inhibition of 1 -deoxy-Dxylulose- 5 -phosphate synthase activity by accumulated plastidic dimethylallyl diphosphate almost completely explained thisreduction in carbon flux. Our data demonstrate that short-term biochemical feedback regulation of 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate synthase activity by plastidic dimethylallyl diphosphate is an important regulatory mechanism of the MEPpathway. Despite being relieved from the large carbon demand of isoprene biosynthesis, NE plants redirected onlyapproximately 0. 5 % of this saved carbon toward essential nonvolatile isoprenoids, i. e. b-carotene and lutein, most probablyto compensate for the absence of isoprene and its antioxidant properties...|$|E
40|$|Waterlogging is {{a serious}} {{impediment}} to crop productivity worldwide which acts to reduce oxygen levels in the rhizosphere due to the low diffusion rate of molecular oxygen in water. Plants respond to low oxygen through rapid and specific changes at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Transcriptional changes to low-oxygen (hypoxia) stress have been studied {{in a number of}} plant species using whole genome microarrays. Using transcriptome data from root tissue from early time points (4 – 5 h) from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), Arabidopsis and <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus x canescens), we have identified a core set of orthologous genes that responded to hypoxia in similar ways between species, and others that showed species specific responses. Responses to hypoxia were most similar between Arabidopsis and cotton, while the waterlogging tolerant poplar species exhibited some significant differences...|$|E
50|$|Gypsy moth larvae prefer oak trees, but may feed on {{many species}} of trees and shrubs, both {{hardwood}} and conifer. In the eastern US, the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, speckled alder, basswood, <b>gray,</b> paper birch, <b>poplar,</b> willow, and hawthorns, amongst other species. The gypsy moth avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, cucumber tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high. Older larvae feed on several species of softwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: During the {{recultivation}} of {{the uranium}} mining area of Kõvágószõlõs (Hungary), the tailings {{were covered with}} clay and loess soil layers having a thickness of 30 cm and 100 cm, respectively. In the loess covering layer, acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), poplars (Populus × albus, Populus × canescens), oak (Quercus pubescens), silver tree (Eleagnus angustifolia) were planted between 1996 and 2004. In order to establish {{the extent of the}} uranium and thorium transport from the sludge to the leaves by uptake and translocation processes through roots with a length higher than 1. 3 m results in a remarkable redistribution of these pollutants, a <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> tree, growing spontaneously in the last uncovered tailing, being selected as reference tree. The U and Th concentrations in the leaves of the above-mentioned trees, in the covering layers {{as well as in the}} original sludge were determined by inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SF-MS). Generally, the Th concentration of the soils was about 4 times higher than that of uranium, while uranium concentration was about 10130 times higher than that of thorium in the leaf samples and its concentration ranged from 28 to 1045 ng g− 1, the last value belonging to the poplar tree growing on the last uncovered tailing. In order to assume the mobility and bioavailability of uranium if the dry leaves fall down, the uranium species in the leaves of the poplar tree growing in the uncovered reservoir were determined applying ultrasound-assisted extraction with distilled water and ammonium acetate as well as high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) -ICP-SF-MS technique. About 20 % of total uranium could be extracted in form of uranyl cations and a presumably negatively charged uranium compound. Estimations revealed that the annual increment of U in the soil surface layer due to the dead fallen leaves in case of the investigated <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) is about 1. 2 %...|$|E
30|$|Reforestation in {{the humid}} tropics and arid zones, where trees are often subject to stresses, is an {{effective}} approach for mitigating global warming. Forestation with Populus species that are tolerant to the stresses in such regions has been conducted. The selection of poplar trees with higher stress tolerance leads to more efficient reforestation. The genome-wide bioinformatics approaches of gene function {{have been used for}} revealing the mechanisms of biological processes, including such stress tolerance. The decoding of the poplar genome has been followed by the genome-wide identification of genes and then the inference of gene function for systematic understanding of biological processes. To predict gene function in poplar, we analyzed poplar gene expression data using DNA microarray datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and developed a database for poplar gene co-expression analysis. Using the database, we illustrate the steps to retrieve two groups of co-expressed genes that are specifically expressed in experiments of hypoxic stress response in <b>gray</b> <b>poplar,</b> a flooding-tolerant tree species. Our database allows users to extract genes involved in biological processes, such as stress reaction, and then is useful for understanding such mechanisms in tree species.|$|E
40|$|Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) is a {{promising}} oil-seed crop for biodiesel production. However, {{the species is}} highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can result in stunted growth and yield loss. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to waterlogging in Jatropha remain elusive. Here, the transcriptome adjustment of Jatropha roots to waterlogging was examined by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The results indicated that 24 h of waterlogging caused significant changes in mRNA abundance of 1, 968 genes. Comprehensive gene ontology and functional enrichment analysis of root transcriptome revealed that waterlogging promoted responses to hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. On the other hand, the stress inhibited carbohydrate synthesis, cell wall biogenesis, and growth. The results also highlighted the roles of ethylene, nitrate, and nitric oxide in waterlogging acclimation. In addition, transcriptome profiling identified 85 waterlogging-induced transcription factors including members of AP 2 /ERF, MYB, and WRKY families implying that reprogramming of gene expression is a vital mechanism for waterlogging acclimation. Comparative analysis of differentially regulated transcripts in response to waterlogging among Arabidopsis, <b>gray</b> <b>poplar,</b> Jatropha, and rice further revealed not only conserved but species-specific regulation. Our findings unraveled the molecular responses to waterlogging in Jatropha and provided new perspectives for developing a waterlogging tolerant cultivar in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and physiological}} responses of <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) following root hypoxia were studied in roots and leaves using transcript and metabolite profiling. The {{results indicate that}} there were changes in metabolite levels in both organs, but changes in transcript abundance were restricted to the roots. In roots, starch and sucrose degradation were altered under hypoxia, and concurrently, the availability of carbohydrates was enhanced, concomitant with depletion of sucrose from leaves and elevation of sucrose in the phloem. Consistent with the above, glycolytic flux and ethanolic fermentation were stimulated in roots but not in leaves. Various messenger RNAs encoding components of biosynthetic pathways such as secondary cell wall formation (i. e. cellulose and lignin biosynthesis) and other energy-demanding processes such as transport of nutrients were significantly down-regulated in roots but not in leaves. The reduction of biosynthesis was unexpected, as shoot growth was not affected by root hypoxia, suggesting that the up-regulation of glycolysis yields sufficient energy to maintain growth. Besides carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism was severely affected in roots, as seen from numerous changes in the transcriptome and the metabolome related to nitrogen uptake, nitrogen assimilation, and amino acid metabolism. The coordinated physiological and molecular responses in leaves and roots, coupled with the transport of metabolites, reveal important stress adaptations to ensure survival during long periods of root hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|Ectomycorrhizas (EMs) {{alleviate}} {{stress tolerance}} of host plants, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. To elucidate {{the basis of}} EM-induced physiological changes and their involvement in stress adaptation, we investigated metabolic and transcriptional profiles in EM and non-EM roots of <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) in the presence and absence of osmotic stress imposed by excess salinity. Colonization with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus increased root cell volumes, a response associated with carbohydrate accumulation. The stress-related hormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid were increased, whereas jasmonic acid and auxin were decreased in EM compared with non-EM roots. Auxin-responsive reporter plants showed that auxin decreased in the vascular system. The phytohormone changes in EMs are in contrast to those in arbuscular mycorrhizas, suggesting that EMs and arbuscular mycorrhizas recruit different signaling pathways to influence plant stress responses. Transcriptome analyses on a whole genome poplar microarray revealed activation of genes related to abiotic and biotic stress responses {{as well as of}} genes involved in vesicle trafficking and suppression of auxin-related pathways. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated EM-related genes whose transcript abundances were independent of salt stress and a set of salt stress-related genes that were common to EM non-salt-stressed and non-EM salt-stressed plants. Salt-exposed EM roots showed stronger accumulation of myoinositol, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid and higher K+-to-Na+ ratio than stressed non-EM roots. In conclusion, EMs activated stress-related genes and signaling pathways, apparently leading to priming of pathways conferring abiotic stress tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{targeted}} cultivation possibilities of energy plants in Slovakia and to evaluate the appropriateness of targeted cultivation of energy plants Populus and energy grass Miscanthus. In Slovakia, is used the classification system of regions according territorial statistical units - NUTS (NUTS III - 8 regions). The highest potential for the cultivation of energy plants (soil quality group 5 - 9) is in Prešov (99. 95 %), Žilina (99. 89 %) and Košice (99. 51) region. The research was conducted at the research locality of the energy plants in Kolíňany (Nitra region). We studied four Italian varieties of <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) (Monviso, Pegaso, AF- 2 and Sirio) and two genotypes of energy grass Miscanthus (Miscantus × giganteus (Greef et Deuter, 1993) and Miscanthus sinensis (Tatai)). Production of Populus varieties after the first growing cycle (2009 - 2012), exceeding the value of the economic threshold was 67. 42 t ha- 1 (AF- 2) to 87. 16 t ha- 1 (Monviso). Both genotypes of Miscanthus produce an economically interesting production of dry mass for the 4 year period (2010 - 2013) (Miscantus × giganteus (Greef et Deuter) 88. 97 t ha- 1 and Miscanthus sinensis (Tatai) 77. 80 t ha- 1).

40|$|The {{consequences}} of altered abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity in <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens [Ait. ] Sm.) development were examined by ectopic {{expression of the}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant abi 1 (for abscisic acid insensitive 1) gene. The expression resulted in an ABA-insensitive phenotype revealed by a strong tendency of abi 1 poplars to wilt, impaired responsiveness of their stomata to ABA, and an ABA-resistant bud outgrowth. These plants therefore required cultivation under very humid conditions to prevent drought stress symptoms. Morphological alterations became evident when comparing abi 1 poplars with poplars expressing Arabidopsis nonmutant ABI 1 or wild-type plants. abi 1 poplars showed increased stomatal size, enhanced shoot growth, and retarded leaf and root development. The increased stomatal size and its reversion {{to the size of}} wild-type plants by exogenous ABA indicate a role for ABA in regulating stomatal development. Enhanced shoot growth and retarded leaf and root development support the hypothesis that ABA acts independently from drought stress as a negative regulator of growth in shoots and as a positive regulator of growth in leaves and roots. In shoots, we observed an interaction of ABA with ethylene: abi 1 poplars exhibited elevated ethylene production, and the ethylene perception inhibitor Ag+ antagonized the enhanced shoot growth. Thus, we provide evidence that ABA acts as negative regulator of shoot growth in nonstressed poplars by restricting ethylene production. Furthermore, we show that ABA has a role in regulating shoot branching by inhibiting lateral bud outgrowth...|$|E

The reconstruction of past debris-flow activity was, in contrast, only very rarely based on growth anomalies in broad-leaved trees. Consequently, this study aimed at dating the occurrence of former debris flows from growth series of broad-leaved trees and at determining their suitability for dendrogeomorphic research. Results were obtained from gray alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench), silver birch and pubescent birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), white poplar, black poplar and <b>gray</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus alba L., Populus nigra L. and Populus x canescens (Ait.) Sm.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and black elder (Sambucus nigra L.) injured by debris-flow activity at Illgraben (Valais, Swiss Alps). Tree-ring analysis of 104 increment cores, 118 wedges and 93 cross-sections from 154 injured broad-leaved trees allowed the reconstruction of 14 debris-flow events between AD 1965 and 2007. These events were compared with archival records on debris-flow activity at Illgraben. It appears that debris flows are very common at Illgraben, but only very rarely left the channel over the period AD 1965 – 2007. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of disturbed trees contributed to the identification of six patterns of debris-flow routing and led to the determination of preferential breakout locations of events. The results of this study demonstrate the high potential of broad-leaved trees for dendrogeomorphic research and for the assessment of the travel distance and lateral spread of debris-flow surges...|$|E
