However, there are two additional weighty moral reasons in favor of routine vaccination: fairness and concern for the vulnerable. These moral reasons in favor of vaccination are not defeated by a parental prerogative to prioritize the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> one’s children over the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> others...|$|R
