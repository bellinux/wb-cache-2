5|$|Starting in 2011, Friskies {{has been}} {{developing}} digital games for cats on mobile <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> are played using touch-screens. Some of its early games included Cat Fishing, JitterBug and Pull 'n Play, which each focused on chasing moving targets on the screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> supply power and type-B receptacles on target <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|E
50|$|A <b>device</b> <b>that</b> {{performs}} the multiplexing {{is called a}} multiplexer (MUX), and a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> {{performs the}} reverse process is called a demultiplexer (DEMUX or DMX).|$|R
50|$|A {{modulator}} is a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> performs modulation. A demodulator (sometimes detector or demod) is a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> performs demodulation, {{the inverse}} of modulation. A modem (from modulator-demodulator) can perform both operations.|$|R
5000|$|A Volume Boot Record (VBR) is {{the first}} sector of a data storage <b>device</b> <b>that</b> has not been partitioned, or the first sector of an {{individual}} partition on a data storage <b>device</b> <b>that</b> has been partitioned.

5|$|Within {{parallel}} computing, {{there are}} specialized parallel <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> remain niche areas of interest. While not domain-specific, {{they tend to}} be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled <b>devices,</b> <b>that</b> are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5000|$|The {{called party}} (in some {{contexts}} called the [...] "B-Number") {{is a person}} who (or <b>device</b> <b>that)</b> answers a telephone call. The person who (or <b>device</b> <b>that)</b> initiates a telephone call is the calling party.|$|R

50|$|A {{floppy disk}} {{hardware}} emulator is a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> emulates a mechanical {{floppy disk drive}} with a solid state or network storage <b>device</b> <b>that</b> is plug compatible with the drive it replaces, similar to how solid-state drives replace mechanical hard disk drives.|$|R
5|$|<b>Devices</b> <b>that</b> must {{withstand}} {{extremely high}} temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
50|$|An {{autosampler}} {{is commonly}} a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> is coupled to an analytical instrument providing samples periodically for analysis. An autosampler {{can also be}} understood as a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> collects samples periodically from a large sample source, like the atmosphere or a lake, for example.|$|R

5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo. Also in 1980, the new embassy under construction in Moscow was found to be so riddled with listening <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> it would be unusable for secure work.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
50|$|A {{hardware}} security module (HSM) is {{a physical}} computing <b>device</b> <b>that</b> safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing.

It uses many of the themes and plot <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and <b>devices,</b> <b>that</b> provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{had over}} 50 handset partners, when Windows Mobile {{was still being}} shipped on new devices. 80% of the 50 million Windows Mobile <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> were made from launch to February 2009 were built by one {{contract}} manufacturing group, HTC, which makes handsets for several major companies under their brands, and under its own brand.|$|E
