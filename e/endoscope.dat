The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology {{was applied to}} one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic <b>endoscope.</b> Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an <b>endoscope.</b> The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the <b>endoscope.</b> The <b>endoscope</b> is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle {{manipulation}} under vision guides the <b>endoscope</b> into the esophagus. The <b>endoscope</b> is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The <b>endoscope</b> is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the <b>endoscope</b> is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the <b>endoscope.</b> Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|E

The <b>endoscope</b> has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the <b>endoscope</b> onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Endoscopic {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) screening is currently implemented in many countries. Since <b>endoscopes</b> cannot be sterilised, {{the transmission of}} infectious agents through <b>endoscopes</b> has {{been a matter of}} concern. We report on a continuous quality control programme in a large-scale randomised controlled trial on flexible sigmoidoscopy screening of an average-risk population. Continuously, throughout a two-year screening period, series of microbiological samples were taken from cleaned ready-to-use <b>endoscopes</b> and cultured for bacterial growth. Results 8573 endoscopies were performed during the trial period. Altogether, 178 microbiological samples (2 %) were taken from the biopsy channels and surfaces from the <b>endoscopes.</b> One sample (0. 5 %) showed faecal contamination (Enterobacter cloacae), and 25 samples (14 %) showed growth of environmental bacteria. Conclusions Growth of bacteria occurs in a clinical significant number of samples from ready-to-use <b>endoscopes.</b> Pathogenic bacteria, however, were found only in one sample. Improvement of equipment design and cleaning procedures are desirable and continuous microbiological surveillance of <b>endoscopes</b> used in CRC screening is recommended. </p...|$|R

At the bottom of the primary containment structure, 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The radiation level measured was 72.9 Sievert per hour. Because of this, the <b>endoscope</b> could only function a few hours at this place.

25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern <b>endoscope,</b> was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an <b>endoscope</b> (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's <b>endoscope</b> was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a diagnostic procedure in which an <b>endoscope</b> is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E

The SEMS is placed through the channel of the <b>endoscope</b> into the esophagus over a guidewire, marked on fluoroscopy, and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the <b>endoscope)</b> such that it expands when in position.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the quality of disinfection of <b>endoscopes</b> at Brest hospital over a period from 2007  to 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of microbiological investigations of <b>endoscopes</b> done at Brest hospital from 2007  to 2009. The interpretation of the microbiological investigations is based on the recommendations of the Comité technique national des infections nosocomiales et infections liées aux soins (CTINILS) of 2007. RESULTS: Most of the controls realized over the period deal with gastroenterological <b>endoscopes</b> (63. 4  %) and bronchial <b>endoscopes</b> (21. 8  %). Most of the controls (66. 8  %) are conformed to the target level. Only 26. 7  % of the controls get the level of action. Globally, the rate of level of action significantly increases (p= 0. 004) from 2007 (21. 2  %) to 2009 (35. 6  %). This increase is relatively important in gastroenterology endoscopy (46. 8  % in 2009  versus 24. 1  % in 2007) whereas the rate decreases in bronchial endoscopy (14. 8  % in 2009  versus 25. 9  % in 2007). In gastroenterological endoscopy, rates vary with the type of <b>endoscopes</b> and the context of controls, but there is no significant difference between manual disinfection and automated disinfection. The most frequent germ found in gastroenterological and bronchial endoscopies is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results show that it is very difficult to insure a perfect disinfection of <b>endoscopes.</b> Difficulties met are certainly related with the complexity of the <b>endoscopes</b> and of the techniques of disinfection. Infections of patients are very infrequent in endoscopy, which takes the question of the pertinence of the threshold used for microbiological investigations...|$|R
