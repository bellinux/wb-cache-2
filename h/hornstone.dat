60|$|Kosdera, {{where we}} halted, {{is a pretty}} place, {{elevated}} 440 feet, with a broad stream front the hills flowing past it. These hills are of limestone, and rounded, resting upon others of <b>hornstone</b> and jasper. Following up the stream I came to some rapids, where the stream is crossed by large beds of <b>hornstone</b> and porphyry rocks, excessively hard, and pitched up at right angles, or with a bold dip to the north. The number of strata was very great, {{and only a few}} inches or even lines thick: they presented all varieties of jasper, <b>hornstone,</b> and quartz of numerous colours, with occasional seams of porphyry or breccia. The racks were elegantly fringed with a fern I had not hitherto seen, Polypodium proliferum, which is the only species the Soane valley presents at this season.|$|E
60|$|One of my carts {{was here}} hopelessly broken down; {{advancing}} on the spokes {{instead of the}} tire of the wheels. By the banks of a deep gully here the rocks are well exposed: they consist of soft clay shales resting on the limestone, which is nearly horizontal; and this again, unconformably on the quartz and <b>hornstone</b> rocks, which are confused, and tilted up at all angles.|$|E
6000|$|Jackson, in his [...] "Report on the Geology of Maine," [...] says: [...] "Hornstone, {{which will}} answer for flints, occurs {{in various parts}} of the State. The largest mass of this stone known in the world is Mount Kineo, upon Moosehead Lake, which appears to be entirely {{composed}} of it, and rises seven hundred feet above the lake level. This variety of <b>hornstone</b> I have seen in every part of New England in the form of Indian arrow-heads, hatchets, chisels, etc., which were probably obtained from this mountain by the aboriginal inhabitants of the country." ...|$|E
25|$|Nearly 4000 lithic tools {{have been}} {{recovered}} from Okladnikov Cave. Mousterian artefacts are found throughout all seven layers. The tool assemblage consisted mostly of scrapers and scraper-knives. Around {{a quarter of the}} tools at Okladnikov Cave were made from jasperoids, while around 5% were made from <b>hornstones.</b>|$|R
50|$|When a rock is contact {{altered by}} an igneous {{intrusion}} it very frequently becomes more indurated, and more coarsely crystalline. Many altered rocks {{of this type}} were formerly called <b>hornstones,</b> and the term hornfels is often used by geologists to signify thosefine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. A shale may become a dark argillaceous hornfels, full of tiny plates of brownish biotite; a marl or impure limestone may change to a grey, yellow or greenish lime-silicate-hornfels or siliceous marble, tough and splintery, with abundant augite, garnet, wollastonite and other minerals in which calcite is an important component. A diabase or andesite may become a diabase hornfels or andesite hornfels with development of new hornblende and biotite and a partial recrystallization of the original feldspar. Chert or flint may become a finely crystalline quartz rock; sandstones lose their clastic structure and are converted into a mosaic of small close-fitting grains of quartz in a metamorphic rock called quartzite.|$|R
60|$|Soon after {{descending}} {{to the bed}} of the valley, {{which is}} broad and open, we came on a second dry lake-bed, a mile long, with shelving banks all round, heavily snowed on the shaded side; the river was divided into many arms, and meandered over it, and a fine glacier-bound valley opened into it from the south. There were no boulders on its surface, which was pebbly, with tufts of grass and creeping tamarisk. On the banks I observed much granite, with large mica crystals, <b>hornstone,</b> tourmaline, and stratified quartz, with granite veins parallel to the foliation or lamination.|$|E
60|$|All around here, as at Roump, {{is a dead}} flat, except {{towards the}} crest of the ghats which {{overhang}} the valley of the Soane, and there the sandstone rock rises by steps into low hills. During a ride to a natural tank amongst these rocky elevations, I passed from the alluvium to the sandstone, and at once met with all the prevailing plants of the granite, gneiss, limestone and <b>hornstone</b> rocks previously examined, and which I have enumerated too often to require recapitulation; a convincing proof that the mechanical properties and not the chemical constitution of the rocks regulate the distribution of these plants.|$|E
60|$|I {{reached the}} east bank of the Tambur, on the 13th of November, at its {{junction}} with the Khawa, in a deep gorge. It formed a grand stream, larger than the Teesta, of a pale, sea-green, muddy colour, and flowed rapidly with a strong ripple, but no foam; it rises six feet in the rains, but ice never descends nearly so low; its breadth was sixty to eighty yards, its temperature 55 degrees to 58 degrees. The breadth of the foaming Khawa was twelve to fifteen yards, and its temperature 56.5 degrees. The surrounding vegetation was entirely tropical, consisting of scrubby sal trees, acacia, Grislea, Emblica, Hibiscus, etc.; the elevation being but 1300 feet, though the spot was twenty-five miles {{in a straight line}} from the plains. I camped at the fork of the rivers, on a fine terrace fifty feet above the water, about seventy yards long, and one hundred broad, quite flat-topped, and composed of shingle, gravel, etc., with enormous boulders of gneiss, quartz, and <b>hornstone,</b> much water-worn; it was girt by another broken terrace, twelve feet or so above the water, and covered with long grass and bushes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{sandstone}} to {{the east}} of Kala-panee is capped by some beds, forty feet thick, of conglomerate worn into cliffs; these are the remains of a very extensive horizontally stratified formation, now all but entirely denuded. In the valley itself, the sandstone alternates with alum shales, which rest on a bed of quartz conglomerate, and the latter on black greenstone. In the bed of the river, whose waters are beautifully clear, are <b>hornstone</b> rocks, dipping north-east, and striking north-west. Beyond the Kalapanee the road ascends about 600 feet, and is well quarried in hard greenstone; and passing through a narrow gap of conglomerate rock,* [Formed of rolled masses of greenstone and sandstone, united by a white and yellow cement.] enters a shallow, wild, and beautiful valley, through which it runs for several miles. The hills on either side are of greenstone capped by tabular sandstone, immense masses of which have been precipitated {{on the floor of the}} valley, producing a singularly wild and picturesque scene. In the gloom of the evening it is not difficult for a fertile imagination to fancy castles and cities cresting the heights above.* [Hydrangea grows here, with ivy, Mussoenda, Pyrua, willow, Viburnum, Parnassia, Anemone, Leycesteria formosa, Neillia, Rubus, Astilbe, rose, Panax, apple, Bucklandia, Daphne, pepper, Scindapsus, Pierix, holly, Lilium giganteum ("Kalang tatti," [...] Khas.), Camellia, Elaeocarpus, Buddleia, etc. Large bees' nests hang from the rocks.] ...|$|E
6000|$|The ascent was {{alternately}} over steep rocky slopes, {{and broad}} shelf-like flats; many more plants grew here than I had expected, in inconspicuous scattered tufts.* [Besides those before mentioned, there were Fescue-grass (Festuca ovina of Scotland), a strong-scented silky wormwood (Artemisia), and round tufts of Oxytropis chiliophylla, {{a kind of}} Astralagus that inhabits eastern and western Tibet; this alone was green: it formed great circles on the ground, the centre decaying, and the annual shoots growing outwards, and thus constantly enlarging the circle. A woolly Leontopodium, Androsace, and some other plants assumed nearly the same mode of growth. The rest of the vegetation consisted of a Sedum, Nardostachys Jatamansi, Meconopsis horridula, a slender Androsace, Gnaphalium, Stipa, Salvia, Draba, Pedicularis, Potentilla or Sibbaldia, Gentiana and Erigeron alpinus of Scotland. All these grow nearly up to 18,000 feet.] The rocks were nearly vertical strata of quartz, <b>hornstone,</b> and conglomerate, striking north-west, and dipping south-west 80 degrees. The broad {{top of the hill}} was also of quartz, but covered with angular pebbles of the rocks transported from Kinchinjhow. Some clay-stone fragments were stained red with oxide of iron, and covered with Parmelia miniata;* [This minute lichen, mentioned at chapter xxxii, is the most Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine in the world; often occurring so abundantly as to colour the rocks of an orange red. This was the case at Bhomtso, and is so also in Cockburn Island in the Antarctic ocean, which it covers so profusely that the rocks look as if brightly painted. See [...] "Ross's Voyage," [...] vol. ii. p. 339.] this, with Borrera, another lichen, which forms stringy masses blown along by the wind, were the only plants, and they are among the most alpine in the world.|$|E
60|$|The hills are <b>hornstone</b> and quartz, {{stratified}} and dipping southerly with a {{very high}} angle; they are very barren, and evidently identical with those on the south bank of the Soane; skirting, in both cases, the granite and gneiss range of Paras-nath. The alluvium {{on the banks of}} the Ganges is obviously an aqueous deposit subsequent to the elevation of these hills, and is perfectly plane up to their bases. The river has its course through the alluvium, like the Soane. The depth of the former is in many places upwards of 100 feet, and the kunker pebbles it contains are often disposed in parallel undulating bands. It nowhere contains sand pebbles or fossils; concretions of lime (kunker) alone interrupting its uniform consistence. It attains its greatest thickness in the valleys of the Ganges and the Soane, gradually sloping up to the Himalaya and Curruckpore hills on either flank. It is, however, well developed on the Kymore and Paras-nath hills, 1200 to 1500 feet above the Ganges valley, and I have no doubt was deposited in very deep water, when the relative positions of these mountains to the Ganges and Soane valleys were the same that they are now. Like every other part of the surface of India, it has suffered much from denudation, especially on the above-named mountains, and around their bases, where various rocks protrude through it. Along the Ganges again, its surface is an unbroken level between Chunar and the rocks of Monghyr. The origin of its component mineral matter must be sought in the denudation of the Himalayas within a very recent geological period. The contrast between the fertility of the alluvium and the sterility of the protruded quartzy rocks is very striking, cultivation running up to these fields of stones, and suddenly stopping.|$|E
60|$|Dikes are {{frequent}} in the metamorphic schists of the Chonos Islands, and seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient volcanic rocks on the south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego. At S. Andres I {{observed in the}} space of half-a-mile, seven broad, parallel dikes, composed of three varieties of trap, running in a N.W. and S.E. line, parallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges of altered clay-slate; but they must be of long subsequent origin to these mountains; for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the last chapter. North of Tres Montes, I noticed three dikes differing from each other in composition, one of them having a euritic base including large octagons of quartz; these dikes, as well as several of porphyritic greenstone at Vallenar Bay, extended N.E. and S.W., nearly at right angles to the foliation of the schists, but in the line of their joints. At Low's Harbour, however, a set of great parallel dikes, one ninety yards and another sixty yards in width, have been guided by the foliation of the mica-schist, and hence are inclined westward at an angle of 45 degrees: these dikes are formed of various porphyritic traps, some of which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded grains of quartz. A porphyritic trap of this latter kind, passed in one of the dikes into a most curious <b>hornstone,</b> perfectly white, with a waxy fracture and pellucid edges, fusible, and containing many grains of quartz and specks of iron pyrites. In the ninety-yard dike several large, apparently now quite isolated, fragments of mica-slate were embedded: but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the surrounding solid rock, no doubt these new separate fragments originally formed wedge-shaped depending portions of a continuous vault or crust, once extending over the dike, but since worn down and denuded.|$|E
60|$|In a {{geographical}} {{point of view}} the range of hills between Burdwan and the Soave is interesting, as being the north-east continuation of a chain which crosses the broadest part of the peninsula of India, from the Gulf of Cambay to the junction of the Ganges and Hoogly at Rajmahal. This range runs south of the Soane and Kymore, which it meets I believe at Omerkuntuk;* [A lofty mountain said to be 7000-8000 feet high.] the granite of this and the sandstone of the other, being there both overlaid with trap. Further west again, the ranges separate, the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite, forming the Satpur range, which divides {{the valley of the}} Taptee from that of the Nerbudda. The Paras-nath range is, though the most difficult of definition, the longer of the two parallel ranges; the Vindhya continued as the Kymore, terminating abruptly at the Fort of Chunar on the Ganges. The general and geological features of the two, especially along their eastern course, are very different. This consists of metamorphic gneiss, in various highly inclined beds, through which granite hills protrude, the loftiest of which is Paras-nath. The north-east Vindhya (called Kymore), on the other hand, consists of nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, overlying inclined beds of non-fossiliferous limestone. Between the latter and the Paras-nath gneiss, come (in order of superposition) shivered and undulating strata of metamorphic quartz, <b>hornstone,</b> hornstone- porphyry, jaspers, etc. These are thrown up, by greenstone I believe, along the north and north-west boundary of the gneiss range, and are to be recognised as forming the rocks of Colgong, of Sultangunj, and of Monghyr, on the Ganges, as also various detached hills near Gyah, and along the upper course of the Soane. From these are derived the beautiful agates and cornelians, so famous under the name of Soane pebbles, and they are equally common on the Curruckpore range, as on the south bank of the Soane, so much so in the former position as to have been used in the decoration of the walls of the now ruined palaces near Bhagulpore.|$|E
50|$|Hammerstones are or {{were used}} to produce flakes and hand axes {{as well as more}} {{specialist}} tools from materials such as flint and chert. They were applied to the edges of such stones so that the impact forces caused brittle fractures, and loss of flakes for example. They were also widely used to reduce the bulk of other hard stones such as jade, jadeite and <b>hornstone</b> to make polished stone tools. A good example is the <b>hornstone</b> found in the English Lake District used to make polished axes during the early Neolithic period, and known as the Langdale axe industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{base of the}} Achtermannshöhe is part of {{the granite}} massif of the Brocken, which extends across a wide area between Wurmberg, Torfhaus and Elend. By contrast, the rocky, {{treeless}} Kuppe of the Achtermann comprises hornfels, a contact metamorphic rock. The <b>hornstone</b> on the summit has a depth of about 10 m and was formed from Grauwacke as it was heated during the intrusion of granitic magma.|$|E
5000|$|Mount Kineo, with 700-foot (200 m) cliffs rising {{straight}} up from Moosehead Lake, has attracted visitors for centuries, from early American Indians (Red Paint People), to later tribes seeking its flint called <b>hornstone,</b> Penobscots and Norridgewocks, the Abenaki bands who battled here with their enemy the Mohawks, to 19th-century [...] "rusticators" [...] traveling by railroad and steamboat and today's hotel guests. Various species dwell among its cliffs and talus slopes, including peregrine falcons and rare plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} {{outcrops}} of fine-grained greenstone or <b>hornstone</b> suitable for making polished stone axes. Such axes {{have been found}} distributed across Great Britain. The rock is an epidotised greenstone quarried or perhaps just collected from the scree slopes in the Langdale Valley on Harrison Stickle and Pike of Stickle. The {{nature and extent of}} the axe-flaking sites making up the Langdale Axe Factory complex are still under investigation.Geological mapping has established that the volcanic tuff used for the axes outcrops along a narrow range of the highest peaks in the locality. Other outcrops in the area are known to have been worked, especially on Harrison Stickle, and Scafell Pike where rough-outs and flakes have been found on platforms below the peaks at and above the 2000- or 3000-foot level.|$|E
30|$|The Bijawar {{group is}} the Meso-proterozoic {{formations}} deposited over the Archean Bundelkhand craton and it is exposed along its southeastern (Hirapur and Sonarai Basins) and northwestern (Gwalior Basin) margins. The Bijawar group consists in succession of a basal conglomeratic horizon and quartzite overlain by <b>hornstone</b> breccias, limestone, phyllitic shales, red jaspers, and dioritic traps (Pati et al. 2007). These rocks are again well exposed along the southeastern edges of the Vindhyan Syncline where they dip under the Semri Group of the Vindhyan supergroup (Ray 2006). The Vindhyan Supergroup, {{is one of the}} biggest and widest Precambrian sedimentary successions of the world, occupying an area of 1, 04, 000  km 2 in central peninsular India. The basin, spread over Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Bihar. The Vindhyan Basin is bordered to the south by the ENE–WSW trending Narmada-Son lineament. The western margin is delimited by the NE–SW trending Great Boundary Fault closest to the northwest trending Aravalli–Delhi Fold Belt (Venkatachala et al. 1996) and Indo-Gangetic alluvium towards north and east but the basin is deemed to persist underneath of the Gangetic alluvial (Chakraborty 2006). The Vindhyan Supergroup is subdivided into the upper Vindhyan (Kaimur, Rewa, and Bhander Groups) and the lower Vindhyan (Semri Group). The Vindhyan rocks are well exposed in three diverse sectors: the Rajasthan sector, the Bundelkhand sector, and the Son Valley Sector. The study area extends over the Bundelkhand sector which consist the Semri, Kaimur and Rewa group.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{highlights}} potential {{complications that}} {{may arise while}} using in situ produced 10 Be to date exposure or burial events using diagenetic silica (chert). The initiation and evolution of large gravitational collapses in sedimentary rocks were constrained using cosmic ray exposure dating. Because these collapses occurred in a stratigraphic level composed of chert (diagenetic silica) concretions interbedded in limestone layers, their development was studied by performing in situ-produced 36 Cl and 10 Be concentration measurements in both the limestone and coexisting diagenetic silica (chert), respectively. Following the routinely used decontamination and preparation protocols for 10 Be produced in diagenetic silica, large discrepancies were observed with exposure ages determined by 36 Cl within carbonate for samples originating from the same scarp. While 36 Cl exposure ages were clustered as expected for a unique single gravitational event, 10 Be exposure ages were scattered along the same studied scarps. To determine the origin of such a bias, petrological investigations were carried out for chert (diagenetic silica). Thin sections highlighted a complex mineralogical texture characterized by remnant silicified ooids showing calcitic cores, calcite inclusions and a dominant amorphous hydrated silica (grain > 20 μm). To decipher and characterize the potential origins of the excess measured 10 Be within diagenetic silica, all samples were first reprocessed following the routine decontamination protocol (HCL-H 2 SiF 6 leachings and three partial HF dissolutions) but starting from three different grain size fractions (GS 1 : 1000 - 500, GS 2 : 500 - 250 and GS 3 : 250 - 50 μm). The resulting concentrations clearly showed a decreasing 10 Be content {{as a function of}} the grain size, but still yielded 10 Be exposure ages significantly higher than 36 Cl counterparts. Because potential adsorption of 10 Be at the surface of amorphous silica grains was suspected, partial dissolution steps following by a leaching step in hydroxylamine were investigated. Finally, it seems that an additional leaching in KOH allowed removal of the amorphous silica phase and the measured 10 Be concentrations yielded 10 Be exposure ages agreeing within uncertainties with the 36 Cl ones. This work suggests that measuring in situ produced 10 Be within chert (amongst other types of diagenetic silica, e. g. flint, <b>hornstone,</b> jasper, etc.) containing amorphous silica requires caution...|$|E
