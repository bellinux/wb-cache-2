40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{has been}} associated with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. We aim to evaluate the correlation between extracranial veins stenosis evaluated with MR venography (MRV) and clinical/MR parameters of MS. METHODS: In 29 consecutive MS patients we performed a standard brain MRI protocol, completed by the evaluation of extra-cerebral venous system using a phase-contrast and a Volumetric Interpolated Breath Hold Examination (VIBE) sequence before and after gadolinium. The T 2 -proton density images were used to calculate the lesion volume. The <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> were evaluated qualitatively (in terms of presence and severity of stenoses) and quantitatively (degree of stenosis). The phase-contrast images were analyzed to calculate the average and peak velocity in the internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins.</b> RESULTS: Postcontrast VIBE successfully showed the <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> in all the subjects.

50|$|There are {{two sets}} of jugular veins: {{external}} and internal. The left and right external <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> drain into the subclavian <b>veins.</b> The internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> join with the subclavian veins more medially to form the brachiocephalic veins. Finally, {{the left and right}} brachiocephalic veins join to form the superior vena cava, which delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart.|$|R
50|$|The rising central venous {{pressure}} is evidenced by distended <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> while in a non-supine position. It is caused by reduced diastolic filling of the right ventricle, due to pressure from the adjacent expanding pericardial sac. This results in a backup of fluid into the veins draining into the heart, most notably, the <b>jugular</b> <b>veins.</b> In severe hypovolemia, the neck veins may not be distended.|$|R
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the <b>jugular</b> <b>vein</b> and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal <b>jugular</b> <b>vein,</b> and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jugular</b> <b>vein</b> {{thrombosis}} is {{a condition}} that may occur due to infection, intravenous drug use or malignancy. <b>Jugular</b> <b>vein</b> thrombosis can have a varying list of complications, including: systemic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and papilledema.

40|$|BACKGROUNDAND PURPOSE: The {{hypothesis}} thatMS {{could be}} provoked by a derangement {{of the blood}} outflow from the brain has been largely discredited. In part, it was because data on the normal pattern of outfloware scarce andobtainedwith differentmethods. The aimof this studywas to evaluate the normal pattern of outflow for the vertebral and internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> in healthy subjectswithmultigate color Doppler. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five volunteers were studied to assess vessel area, mean velocity, and flow for the vertebral and internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> in the supine and sitting positions. RESULTS: In the sitting position, flow decreases, both in vertebral <b>veins</b> and internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins,</b> as the total vessel area decreases (from 0. 46 0. 57 to 0. 09 0. 08 cm 2), even if the mean velocity increases (from 12. 58 10. 19 to 24. 14 17. 60 cm/s). Contrary to {{what happens to the}} blood inflow, outflow in the supine position, through vertebral and internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins,</b> ismore than twice the outflow in the sitting position (739. 80 326. 32 versus 278. 24 207. 94 mL/min). In the sitting position, on application of very low pressure to the skin with the sonography probe, internal <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> rarely appear to occlude. A pronounced difference of diameter between internal jugular veinswas present in approximately one-third of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the view that other outflow pathways, like the vertebral plexus, {{play a major role in}} the normal physiology of brain circulation and must be assessed to obtain a complete picture of blood outflow.

40|$|Glutaraldehyde treated human {{umbilical}} veins (Dardik Biograft) {{were used}} to bypass short segments of the femoral artery in 15 dogs and were compared to autogenous <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> placed in the contralateral femoral artery of each animal. All 15 autogenous <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> remained patent for the four month period of observation whereas thrombosis occurred in seven of 15 umbilical vein grafts. This patency rate of 53 % was significantly lower than that observed for autogenous <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> (p less than 0. 01). Neointimal Fibrous Hyperplasia (NFH) a the proximal anastomosis was responsible for six of the seven umbilical vein graft occlusions. Of the eight patent umbilical veins, five had varying degrees of proximal anastomotic stenosis secondary to NFH. Histological examination of each graft revealed significant fibroblastic proliferation and collagen deposition within the lumen of stenosed and thrombosed grafts. Although human umbilical veins have distinct advantages over other prosthetics, such as availability and flexibility, the incidence of experimental neointimal fibrous hyperplasia causing anastomotic stenosis and thrombosis is prohibitively high...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} determine if melatonin concentrations differ between <b>jugular</b> <b>veins.</b> In a first experiment, blood was collected continuously every 30 min from each jugular during 12 -h from 6 ewes. In a second experiment, 100 ewes were sampled twice at night simultaneously from the two <b>jugular</b> <b>veins.</b> In both experiments, mean melatonin concentrations were similar between right and left jugulars. However, within individuals, large differences were observed {{between the two sides}} (p < 0. 001). This difference was stable over time and the higher side varies among individuals. The concentrations of prolactin and oxytocin, measured in the same samples did not show such differences. This observation raises the question of the origin of this phenomenon. Moreover, it has important implications for studies in which melatonin concentrations need to be assessed accurately. Indeed, a reliable quantitative assessment of melatonin production by the pineal gland requires sampling from both <b>jugular</b> <b>veins.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: the {{biological}} characteristics of cryopreserved allografts are poorly understood, although many factors {{are known to}} influence their outcome. This study examines the development of transplant vasculopathy in both fresh and cryopreserved vein allografts and specifically assesses the efficacy of a transport solution containing 10 % polyethylene glycol and 10 μM glutathione (PEG/GSH). Methods: <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> were harvested from control donor rabbits and transplanted as interposition carotid bypass grafts in 30 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Ten received the fresh <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> (fresh). Ten animals received <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> which had been harvested, transported in a physiological solution, cryopreserved and stored in a standard fashion (cryopreserved). Ten animals received <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> which had been harvested, transported in the same solution {{with the addition of}} PEG/GSH, cryopreserved and stored in a standard fashion (PEG/GSH). Cryopreserved <b>jugular</b> <b>veins</b> were stored for 6 weeks before transplantation. All animals were sacrificed 28 days postoperatively. Vein grafts were perfusion-fixed and wall dimensions were determined by planimetry. Results: all transplanted grafts were patent at harvest. The control cryopreserved vein grafts showed a 54 % increase in mean intimal thickness (63 ± 10 μm vs. 41 ± 3 μm p< 0. 05) but no change in mean medial thickness (125 ± 9 μm vs. 119 ± 13 μmp =n. s.) compared to the fresh allograft. Transport of the grafts in PEG/GSH solution resulted in the abolition of the increase in intimal thickness (41 ± 4 μmp < 0. 01) associated with cryopreservation without a change in medial thickness (140 ± 15 μmp =n. s.) compared to the cryopreserved allograft. Conclusion: cryopreserved vein grafts develop significant intimal hyperplasia compared to freshly transplanted grafts. The use of PEG/GSH in the transport solution significantly reduces this transplant graft intimal hyperplasia to that which develops in fresh grafts and may lead to improvements in the clinical use of cryopreserved veins...|$|R
