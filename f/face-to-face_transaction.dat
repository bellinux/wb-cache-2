Online advertisers need to promote new, interesting methods to attract customers. One of the methods includes the usage of group buying sites, which provides great deals and offers through online-coupons. Because of this, it would be interesting to see how these group buying sites communicate and persuade readers to read and use their services. This study looks into three main aspects which are the move structure, links on the online advertisements and common linguistic features. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the rhetorical structure and communicative purpose of hotel and lodging online advertisements. This study adopted Askehave and Nielsen’s (2005) two-dimensional model approach as the main framework to analyze the data collected. The usage of this framework accounts for a better explanation on the usage of digital genre as Askehave and Nielsen’s (2005) two-dimensional model approach was used not only for examining the moves in the online advertisements, but also the links involved which provide access to different parts of the web page. In addition, this study also looks at the common linguistic features available in the data collected. Twenty-five different hotel and lodging advertisements were collected from five different group buying sites.

40|$|With {{regard to}} issuer purchases, {{some of the}} {{traditional}} policy rationales against insider trading do not apply or apply with less force. Nevertheless, courts, commentators, and the SEC have all stated or assumed that a public corporation violates rule 10 b- 5 by buying its own shares in the market based on material, nonpublic information. In rule 10 b- 5 cases involving <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions,</b> several circuit courts have ruled that the company may not purchase its own stock based on material information not known to the seller. No good reason exists not to apply these precedents to stock market trades by issuers, especially because block trades blur the distinction between <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> and stock market trades. Some decisions involving <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> have relied on a fiduciary duty running from the corporation to the seller. Although this duty has some appeal, it is unsupported by traditional state law fiduciary duty analysis. The company can act only through its board of directors, officers, employees, and other agents. These actors are obligated {{to act in the}} best interests of the corporation, which may not coincide with the best interests of an individual shareholder transacting business with the company. Under rule 10 b- 5, the most compelling reason for issuer insider trading liability may simply be that no strong reason exists to distinguish the corporation from a corporate 2 ̆ 2 insider, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., an employee or independent contractor. Such an 2 ̆ 2 insider 2 ̆ 2 has a Chiarella/Dirks classical relationship with the innocent shareholder on the other side of the insider trade because of a mutual relationship with the issuer. When an issuer trades on material, nonpublic information, innocent shareholders have a 2 ̆ 2 classical relationship 2 ̆ 2 with the corporation because of their investment. In other words, the relationship between the issuer and one of its shareholders is, if anything, closer than the relationship between an employee/independent-contractor and a shareholder...|$|R

The previous <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> between the lime boss and the client have been replaced by transactions between the lime boss and the reseller, and between the reseller and the client.

Although court interpreters’ instructions generally prescribe verbatim translations of original utterances, the reality in the courtroom may demand deviation from what the guidelines prescribe. Focusing {{on the effect of}} emphasising and down-toning additions on source language texts in four consecutively-interpreted rape trials heard in Shona and English, this study reveals that court interpreters are aware that their primary goal is to ensure that participants fully understand each other’s intentions. Interpreters therefore adopt a strategy for conveying renditions which would ensure that a speaker’s communicative intention, and not only his/her words, is available to an end receiver. The resultant renditions would nevertheless reveal some additions which may impact on the propositional content and style of the source message and hence the administration of justice. I therefore argue that interpreted courtroom dialogues are essentially ‘three-party’ (Mason, 2000 : 9) <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> involving two primary speakers and one interpreter...|$|R

40|$|If {{educational}} psychologists {{wish to make}} {{a meaningful}} difference as practitioners, both to the children they work with and the ecologies these children come from, then, knowledge and application of resilience theory is crucial. Toland and Carrigan (2011) underscore this relationship in their 2011 article in this Journal. In our contribution below, we extend their assertion by urging greater attention to the interactive processes which underpin resilience and, more particularly, to how proximal, <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> embedded in mesosystems and microsystems and nuanced by the distal, macrosystemic influences, mould resilience. Using examples from resilience research conducted in South Africa we argue that such a focus (i. e. on the transactional ecosystemic nature of resilience) is crucial in developing contexts. Furthermore, we contend that sensitivity to mechanisms of resilience {{as well as the}} contexts and cultures in which these continuously evolve, begs an approach to practice that foregrounds the ecosystemic, promotes child-ecology transactions, and is cautious about generalizing resilience theory to children across diverse contexts, cultures and time periods. To conceptualize resilience as anything but a reciprocal, dynamic, contextually-influenced interaction between children and their ecologies, would be to fail children in developing contexts.

40|$|Urbanization and {{economic}} growth in developing countries go hand-in-hand. The simple correlation coefficient across countries between the percent urbanized in a country and GDP per capita (in logs) is about 0. 85. The reason is clear. Economic development involves the transformation of a country from an agricultural based economy to an industrial-service based economy. Production of manufacturing and services is much more efficient when concentrated in dense business-industrial districts in cities. Close spatial proximity, or high density, promotes information spillovers amongst producers, more efficiently functioning labor markets, and savings in the transport costs of parts and components exchange among producers and of sales to local residents. The existence and considerable magnitude of localized scale externalities is well documented empirically (Henderson (1988), Ciccone and Hall (1995), Glaeser et al. (1992)). The transport savings component of high density {{is central to the}} new economic geography literature (Fujita, Krugman, and Venables (1999)) and is starting to be documented, especially for <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> costs in services (Kolko (1999)).

Every transaction made over the Internet reveals bits of information about the user which can be accumulated and abused, thus necessitating security and privacy in order to prevent misuse of data and invasion of personal privacy. In this work, ve eID schemes which are in use or re proposed in EU countries is surveyed and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these schemes is investigated. All the schemes have given importance to security while only a few of them are designed with privacy in mind. Identity Providers in federated eID schemes are observed to be a privacy hotspot as they store user information and can uniquely identify the user. The use of homomorphic encryption and block chain in eID schemes is further explored in order to prevent the Identity Provider from becoming a privacy hotspot while fullling its role in the scheme.

50|$|Given {{the lack}} of ability to inspect {{merchandise}} before purchase, consumers are at higher risk of fraud than <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions.</b> When ordering merchandise online, the item may not work properly, it may have defects, or {{it might not be}} the same item pictured in the online photo. Merchants also risk fraudulent purchases if customers are using stolen credit cards or fraudulent repudiation of the online purchase. However, merchants face less risk from physical theft by using a warehouse instead of a retail storefront. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption has generally solved the problem of credit card numbers being intercepted in transit between the consumer and the merchant. However, one must still trust the merchant (and employees) not to use the credit card information subsequently for their own purchases, and not to pass the information to others. Also, hackers might break into a merchant's web site and steal names, addresses and credit card numbers, although the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is intended to minimize the impact of such breaches. Identity theft is still a concern for consumers. A number of high-profile break-ins in the 2000s has prompted some U.S. states to require disclosure to consumers when this happens. Computer security has thus become a major concern for merchants and e-commerce service providers, who deploy countermeasures such as firewalls and anti-virus software to protect their networks. Phishing is another danger, where consumers are fooled into thinking they are dealing with a reputable retailer, when they have actually been manipulated into feeding private information to a system operated by a malicious party. Denial of service attacks are a minor risk for merchants, as are server and network outages.|$|R
40|$|Currently {{many sites}} exist that enable the {{exchange}} of items online. However, most of these sites inhibit how quickly these items get delivered because of the geographic separation between the buyer and seller. Since the transaction remains solely online, {{it makes it easier}} for the two parties to deceive each other and remain anonymous. This paper focuses on the development of a website called piRentU and the Repu-tation Management System that was necessary for the site to function. piRentU allows people around campuses to rent items from each other for variable periods of time. With piRentU, geographic proximity is no longer an issue. With these new types of in-person interactions, not only do {{you run the risk of}} getting scammed, but your personal safety also becomes an important factor. Interactions shift from online to <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions,</b> which required a user trust sys-tem between parties that goes beyond direct user feedback. Given this, the biggest portion of piRentU is the Reputa-tion Management System. We developed a system in which users gain a reputation score called a “Rep Score ” based off of factors such as direct feedback and their Facebook profile information. This “Rep Score ” goes beyond user feedback, allows for an initial trust score to be established and gives the user a more customized view of each person they in-teract with. This “Rep Score ” algorithm is fully portable to other sites in need of such a system. Only small modification would have to be made according to the database structure of each site. An accurate and efficient algorithm for such a trust system could advance e-commerce even further and re-duce doubts that consumers face when participating in online transactions. 1. BACKGROUN...|$|R

40|$|No {{coherent}} doctrinal statement {{exists for}} calculating open-market damages for securities fraud class actions. Instead, courts have tried {{in vain to}} fashion common-law deceit and misrepresentation remedies to fit open-market fraud. The result is a relatively ineffective system with a hallmark feature: unpredictable damage awards. This poses a significant fraud deterrence problem from both a practical and a theoretical standpoint. In 2005, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to clarify open-market damage principles and to facilitate earlier dismissal of cases without compensable economic losses. Instead, in Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo, it further confused the damage issue by (1) perpetuating the idea that courts can tailor damages from common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions to remedy open-market fraud despite the practical disparities between the two and (2) opening the door to a new form of hypothetical losses where the stock price increases after an opportune disclosure of fraud. By increasing ambiguity in the law governing open-market damages, the Supreme Court may have inhibited securities fraud deterrence in two distinct ways. First, without a standard damage measure, courts have trouble determining whether plaintiffs suffered compensable economic loss from the initial pleadings, which means that a court may hesitate to dismiss even an action that does not plead a prima facie case of fraud. Second, corporate actors cannot weigh the costs of their potentially fraudulent behavior with any certainty. The Supreme Court’s insinuation that a new form of hypothetical losses might be recoverable further inhibits predictability and could have perverse effects on investor education and motivation. In Dura, the Court implied that an investor might be able to recover damages when a stock’s price does not increase as much as it might have absent the fraud. This suggests that plaintiffs might not be limited to traditional out-of-pocket losses. A number of intrinsic problems could result from compensating investors for more than their out-of-pocket losses. For example, providing investors with a double-recovery, one from the net stock price increase and one from class-action damages, could create a perverse incentive to invest purposefully in companies showing signs of fraud. Accordingly, to minimize these effects and to promote predictability, this Article suggests that courts should limit plaintiffs to their out-of-pocket losses and subject expert methodology for calculating damages to a Daubert inquiry. My intention in this Article is not to imply that simply limiting investors to their out-of-pocket losses will provide a quick “fix” for the ills of the securities class-action system. Instead, I hope to highlight some of the intrinsic problems that could result from compensating investors with a net gain and from stretching traditional common-law remedies to fit modern securities-fraud class actions. The out-of-pocket measure is the only common-law remedy that recognizes the distinctions between <b>face-to-face</b> <b>transactions</b> and open-market fraud, that complies with the loss causation requirement, and that limits plaintiffs to their actual damages. Restricting investors to out-of-pocket losses also advances optimal deterrence by increasing predictability through a clear doctrinal damage calculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{welfare of}} the poor turns in large measure not only on technocratic {{development}} “policies”, but the effective delivery of key public services, core elements of which require thousands of <b>face-to-face</b> discretionary <b>transactions</b> (“practices”) by service providers. The importance of (often idiosyncratic) “practices ” was largely ignored in the 1960 s and 70 s, however, as planners in developing countries sought to rapidly emulate the service delivery mechanisms of the developed countries, namely standardized (top-down) “programs” managed by a centralized civil service bureaucracy. Although this approach could claim some notable successes in poor countries, it soon became readily apparent that it had failed early and often in virtually all sectors. Three common civil service reforms in the 1980 s also yielded disappointing results, so in the 1990 s scholars and practitioners began to tout more radical “participatory ” (or bottom-up) proposals for improving service delivery. These new proposals have generated a series of unusual alliances and antagonisms in contemporary development debates. We attempt to unravel these debates by distinguishing between the original solution and eight current proposals for improving service delivery, {{on the basis of}} a principal-agent model of incentives that explores how these various proposals change flows of resources, information, decision-making, delivery mechanisms, and accountability.

The three alternatives provide different ways in which agencies can recover those costs; they could be borne by either an annual appropriation or adjustment of the online service “price” to include the fees within the cost of the online transaction. An additional alternative is presented to leave the current value-added fee practices in place. Recognition must also be made of the fact that traditional forms of conducting business with the State of Iowa, <b>face-to-face</b> and paper-based <b>transactions,</b> are inherently more costly.
