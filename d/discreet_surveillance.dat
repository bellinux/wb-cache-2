25|$|Questioned at {{the scene}} by four officers, Bryson {{initially}} claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before {{he had managed to}} escape by jumping from a window {{on the second floor of}} the property. Furthermore, this individual had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a <b>discreet</b> <b>surveillance</b> of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the rich}} lord is away, the knight arrives by the window, {{in the same}} way he first appeared. The woman glows with her newfound love. The other people of the {{household}} become suspicious of her renewed beauty and put her under <b>discreet</b> <b>surveillance.</b> When the jealous husband learns of the shapechanging knight, he surrounds the window with iron spikes. The next time the knight arrives, he is mortally wounded. He tells the woman that their unborn child, whom she is to name [...] "Yonec", will grow up to avenge their deaths. The knight flies away, and the woman hurls herself from the window and follows a trail of blood to a city made of silver. After passing through a succession of rooms, she eventually finds the knight on his deathbed. He gives her a magic ring that will make her husband forget about her infidelity. He also gives her his sword. As the woman flees the city, she hears the bells tolling for her lover's death.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{the work}} of Foucault, Elias, and Bauman, this article {{examines}} how the playground has articulated specific configurations of power/knowledge. Originallydesigned to cultivate virtue and counteract vice, the playgrounds of the past were tocomplete the discipline of the schoolroom, assisting the trained master to direct thechild s thoughts, feelings, and actions. From its tentative beginnings in the work ofRousseau, the strategy of supervised play was intended to conceal its purpose from thechild, with power exercised through <b>discreet</b> forms of <b>surveillance</b> and constraint thatwould, it was hoped, gradually be embodied and re-enacted as self-restraint. Contemporary playgrounds and here the article focuses on Ireland no longer claim tobe directing the conduct of children. Public playgrounds are framed by the UNConvention on the Rights of the Child, while commercial playgrounds provide a serviceto consumers of play. Yet, both unobtrusively act upon the child s capacity for action,and there is a tension between these different modes of provision. Setting recent Eliasianscholarship on de-civilising processes against Bauman s theory of liquid modernity,and utilising Foucault s notion of government as the conduct of conduct, the articleexamines this tension and shows how it provides insight into the relationship betweenpower, habitus, and (in) civility today...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins with}} Foucault’s {{definition}} of the ‘carceral ’ as an incorporation of “institutions of supervision or constraint, of <b>discreet</b> <b>surveillance</b> and insistent coercion ” (1995, 299) to examine how the invocation of the War Measures Act during World War II translated into virtual incarceration for Japanese Canadians. Using newspaper articles from a one-year period, I apply this definition to Japanese Canadians sent to Alberta and Manitoba {{as part of the}} government sponsored Sugar Beet Programme. This program offers a unique perspective, as it was framed as a ‘self-support ’ program, thus implying a greater range of freedoms. However, despite illusions of freedom, I argue that what made these sites carceral was a combination of state, media and civic mediations. Moving beyond the carceral institution to interrogate less formal spaces of carcerality, this paper strives to build on Foucault’s definition through the inclusion of broader, less bounded and less definitive spaces...|$|E
