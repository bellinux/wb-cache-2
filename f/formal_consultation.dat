2500|$|The {{recommendation}} {{concerning the}} possible removal of high-level shelters {{was to become}} a cause of major disagreement. Traditional [...] "bothies" [...] were built for stalkers and gamekeepers and were in the valleys. The shelters being questioned were modern ones built on the plateau. The argument to keep them was that any shelter in an emergency was better than none – Cairngorm MRT, Banffshire County Council and local estate owners were of this opinion. However the Braemar MRT, most mountaineering bodies, the Chief Constable of police and Adam Watson thought they should be removed. More and more experts and politicians became involved and in July 1973 the Secretary of State for Scotland launched a <b>formal</b> <b>consultation.</b> Eventually the Scottish Office decided it had no powers in the matter. In February 1974 at a meeting which excluded everyone except the local authority, police, and mountaineering experts, a decision for removal was taken and after further argument they were indeed removed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{compliance}} with recommendations and clinical outcomes between formal and informal infectious disease specialist consultations. Six hundred twenty-seven consecutive adult inpatients who received an infectious disease consultation in a university-affiliated hospital were included. After adjusting for quintile of propensity score, we compared compliance with the consultant's recommendations and clinical outcomes for 443 (70. 7 %) and 184 (29. 3 %) <b>formal</b> and informal <b>consultations.</b> Informal and <b>formal</b> <b>consultations</b> were associated with comparable levels of compliance with recommendations for antimicrobial treatment (86. 5 % vs 88. 9 %; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0. 63; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 34 - 1. 14; =[*] 0. 13) and diagnostic or monitoring tests (72. 6 % vs 72. 0 %; aOR, 0. 91 [0. 53 - 1. 57]; =[*] 0. 73). The rates of early clinical improvement (58. 2 % vs 58. 6 %; aOR, 1. 11 [0. 70 - 1. 74]; =[*] 0. 66), subsequent consultation (34. 2 % vs 36. 3 %; aOR, 0. 80 [0. 53 - 1. 21]; =[*] 0. 29), in-hospital mortality (4. 9 % vs 8. 4 %; aOR, 0. 55 [0. 24 - 1. 24]; =[*] 0. 15), and the median length of stay (23 vs 20  days; aOR of discharge, 0. 90 [0. 74 - 1. 10]; =[*] 0. 30) did not differ depending on the type of consultation. This study provides observational evidence that informal consultations result in levels of compliance with recommendations comparable to <b>formal</b> <b>consultations,</b> without compromising patient safety.

However, , the exemption has not gone into effect because the Minister of Finance decided to defer the measure, pending a <b>formal</b> <b>consultation</b> with the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) to ensure that the VAT exemption for leasing was not in violation of the European Economic Area Agreement. The government's loss of revenue due to the still not implemented leasing exemption is estimated at about 47 million krone (around [...] ) per year. One Member of Parliament has criticized the government for the delay. He had argued that the initial VAT exemption for all electric vehicles was never approved in ESA.

The official request for arbitration took place on August 13. Canada responded to this request for arbitration on September 12. The next year, on January 18, the U.S. government filed a second arbitration request, this one focused on the provincial implementation programs of Ontario and Québec. Canada responded on February 18, 2008. On March 4, the LCIA ruled (in the first arbitration) that Canada was {{in violation of the}} 2006 SLA in its eastern provinces, but not in its western provinces. The panel had been made up of a Belgian arbitrator nominated by Canada, a British arbitrator named by the United States, and a panel president from Germany. On February 26, 2009, the LCIA announced its ruling in the second arbitration case: Canada was in breach of the softwood lumber agreement {{as a result of its}} failure to properly calculate quotas from January to June in 2007. The arbitration body ordered that sawmills in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan pay an additional ten percent export charge (up to $68.26 million).

40|$|Each {{respondent}} demonstrated {{at least}} one type {{and in most cases}} several different types of non-adherent behaviour. Inadvertent minor non-adherence occurred because patients forgot to take tablets or muddled doses. Minor deliberate deviations occurred when patients took occasional extra tablets or brought forward doses to achieve better symptom control, often to cater for situations that were anticipated as especially demanding. Deliberate major non-adherence was very common and always related to over-use of medication. The experiences of parkinsonism were particular to the individual. The specific circumstances that prompted an episode of non-adherence varied between patients. Nevertheless there was evidence of negotiation between respondents and the Parkinson's disease nurse specialist; medication regimes were altered in conjunction with the patient during <b>formal</b> <b>consultations</b> and by telephone...|$|R
