5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle of Kosovo. Several women approached Stojanović to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E

Oil minister Zaki Yamani yelled repeatedly not to kill the Prince.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, an Arab country's unnamed {{ambassador}} to Dubai had his marriage annulled after discovering that his bride was cross-eyed and had facial hair. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions {{that the couple}} had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the Sharia court {{that he had been}} deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who had shown him photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.|$|E

She wanted to squeeze him--to cuddle him, just as she used to squeeze and cuddle her kittens. Something {{delightful}} and yearning and brooding seemed to have taken possession of her. She had never felt like this before.|$|R
25|$|Wojtyła {{became the}} 264th pope {{according}} to the chronological list of popes, the first non-Italian in 455 years. At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since Pope Pius IX in 1846, who was 54. Like his predecessor, John PaulII dispensed with the traditional Papal coronation and instead received ecclesiastical investiture with a simplified Papal inauguration on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński knelt down, stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply hugged him.|$|E

In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> sister.|$|E

Once it is lit, however, the group is surprised when the tower explodes and collapses. Grimshank, who watched the scene from a telescope, informs Aneka that Kröd has been killed, causing her to weep on his tunic. He leaves and places the tears in a vial.

25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked him what he was doing there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, but God was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, but God was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, but God was not in the fire. And then came a still small voice, which asked him what he was doing there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E

[...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which he does a pull-up onto the roof to <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner in bed, in racy moments with Usher in nothing but briefs as he pulls off her stockings. The final scene sees the singer driving off in a convertible.|$|E

During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on roof of a Walgreens later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named [...] "Mysterion", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens who want to know just [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving.|$|E

500|$|After {{withdrawing}} from political life, Kogălniceanu served as Romanian Academy President from 1887 to 1889 (or 1890). Having fallen severely ill in 1886, {{he spent his}} final years editing historical documents of the Eudoxiu Hurmuzaki fund, publicizing Ancient Greek and Roman archeological finds in Northern Dobruja, and collecting foreign documents related to Romanian history. One of his last speeches, held {{in front of the}} Academy and witnessed by both Carol, who had since become King of Romania, and his wife Elisabeth of Wied, was a summary of his entire career as a politician, intellectual, and civil servant. In August 1890, while traveling through the Austrian region of Vorarlberg, he was troubled by news that Alecsandri had died at his home in Mircești. Writing to Alecsandri's wife Paulina, he asked: [...] "I could not be present at his funeral, [...] you'll allow me, my lady, since I have unable to kiss him either alive or dead, to at least <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> grave!" ...|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{also had}} a dark fantasy life: he {{performed}} rites with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he {{did not try to}} <b>kiss</b> <b>his</b> teacher, he replied: [...] "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first." [...] He also recalled that as a little boy, he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. Kemper stated in later interviews that as a child some of his favorite games to play were [...] "Gas Chamber" [...] and [...] "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had two near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.|$|E

[...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan.
