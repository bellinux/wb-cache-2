We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And I think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Compromise? Robert, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> so {{differently}} to-night {{from the}} way I have always heard you talk? Why are you changed? ...|$|E
6000|$|This suggestiveness {{was lost}} upon Catherine, who {{repeated}} her violent inquiry. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about separation; {{what do you}} know about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> with Thoth, and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{hear the}} moon-horned Io weep? And know the painted kings who sleep beneath the {{wedge-shaped}} Pyramid? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's funny," [...] {{she said}} thoughtfully. [...] "Bad? I suppose it is. I don't {{know that it}} is. But <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> as if <b>you</b> didn't believe in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about?" [...] asked Marcia, {{requiring}} {{an account}} of his enjoyment from him the next morning, after Bartley had gone down to his work.|$|R
6000|$|GEORGE. Then what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about--your minds? [CLARE {{looks at}} him] Will you answer a {{straight}} question? Is he {{falling in love}} with you? ...|$|E
60|$|Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> so trivially about life? Because I {{think that}} life is far too {{important}} a thing ever to talk seriously about it.|$|E
6000|$|Come, Stanford, let us sit at ease [...] And talk as {{old friends}} <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> of {{anything}} you please, [...] And I will talk of you.|$|E
6000|$|... "They've {{seen the}} Gate, haven't they? Very well, that's enough. As for the rest, you don't know what <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> about, and they wouldn't {{understand}} <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> German." ...|$|R
6000|$|She came to {{the table}} beside my bed and pulled the Michaelmas daisies awry. [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> like that?" [...] {{she said in a}} tone of {{infinite}} bitterness. [...] "To begin like that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not properly, or improperly; not much, or little. I covet many things; {{but nothing}} of that sort. You know, or should know, that I do not. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{of buying a}} French bonnet for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is it you}} mean, Dr Crofts? What is it you are saying? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> that nonsense, {{trying to}} see if you can provoke me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have no brother,' replied Monks. 'You know I {{was an only}} child. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of my affair? {{is it not}} {{you that}} keep the younker's whole estate from him? Dirk Hatteraick never touched a stiver of his rents.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ferris gave a very ironical laugh. [...] "Miss Vervain {{must have}} been about twelve {{years old when she}} left America. Even a lady's {{knowledge}} of business, at that age, is limited. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> with her about it? You had not spoken of it to me, of late, and I thought you were more contented than you used to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A woman's idea of manliness is very extended. You {{expect to}} get everything, and to <b>do</b> nothing. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> of justice! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not know that when I married you, I looked to your uncle's fortune?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, boys," [...] he said, {{after a long}} talk {{upon the}} {{prospects}} of the fighting, [...] "did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about, and draw your pay and get it changed into gold?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOUR meaning exactly, you brazen scarecrow,--what's your meaning?' {{retorted}} Quilp. 'Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to me {{of combining}} together? Do I combine? Do I know anything about your combinings?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sail under false colours! Explain!" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Moss, quickly. [...] "What nonsense <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk?</b> Has not {{my daughter}} explained, {{and she is}} not given to colouring things falsely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> your hog-latin to me for?" [...] {{cried the}} cripple, who, {{throughout}} the address, betrayed the most illiterate obduracy; and, with an incensed look, anew he swung himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't make {{remarks about}} people, Effie," [...] {{said her mother}} sharply. [...] "It isn't nice in little girls, and I don't want <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> too much lately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boss, it's likely <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> fer <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> a lot," [...] replied Farlane. [...] "Lucy {{pulled my}} hat down over my eyes--told {{me to go}} to thunder--an' then, zip! she an' Buckles were dustin' it fer the sage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't—don't say anything—it's no good now, it's too late. It's done; {{and what}} is done, is <b>done.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> any more, I shall say I'm tired and stop the dance. Don't say another word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] said Bastin calmly. [...] "You'll {{find all}} {{about it in the}} Bible if you will only take the trouble to read. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> such rubbish about gases?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{thoughts}} {{moved on}} in the confused, inarticulate suspense of prayer, till he heard her say: [...] "You haven't failed; why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of failing--it isn't true; and don't pray for me, Daddy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Useless?" [...] she cried, and I had an {{instance}} of how sharply could ring the voice that I had heard so gentle. [...] "Of what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk,</b> you knave? Ride on at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You appear," [...] she said, {{without any}} sign of anger in her tone, and with unruffled composure, [...] "to be a very impertinent person. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>talking</b> to some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clara {{turned away}} and groaned aloud several times as she read; but all she said, as she gave it back to Louis, was, 'What is to be <b>done?</b> <b>You</b> must <b>talk</b> to my uncle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My uncle," [...] Virginia said, [...] "judges only by results. After all, it is {{the only}} infallible way. I am going to read a little now. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mind? <b>Talking</b> makes my head ache." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{said there}} WAS? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{to me like}} that for, Huck Finn? You wait till I say a thing's got sense in it before you go to accusing me of saying it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to {{me about}} scruples? I wanted money, and I gave powder in exchange. How could I {{know that some of}} your wretched men were going to be blown up? Scruples! Pah!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she said, [...] "whether I {{ought to}} be looking after you a little more closely, my child. What do you do on the marshes there all the time? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> with this Mr. Andrew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Governor drew {{a breath}} of deep relief. [...] "There are no deads here. So you see none are deads anywhere, and nothing is <b>done.</b> Captain, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to the Company's mens. I think they are not pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} him, for the moment," [...] Ruff answered. [...] "Walk down this {{corridor}} with me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>talking</b> all the time, please? It will sound more natural, and I want to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I didn't," [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "I {{tell you what}} <b>you</b> might <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> might <b>talk</b> him over and make him a little more reasonable. I should be ready to-morrow if he'd come forward." ...|$|R
