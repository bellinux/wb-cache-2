25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. [...] "Everything fizzled out", she said. [...] "I wasted {{a lot of time and}} that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> you cannot afford to do when you are sixty"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.|$|E
500|$|... "Outta My Head" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Nick Levine for Digital Spy described [...] "Outta My Head" [...] as a [...] "genuine surprise" [...] {{because of its}} uptempo style and how different {{it is to the}} rest of the songs on Echo, which Levine thought often sounded the same from song to song. He further wrote that the chorus <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> would suit German Eurodance group Cascada. Writing for The Independent, Andy Gill praised the song for its [...] "fast, juddering" [...] style and wrote that it is the edgiest song on the album. Although, he thought that it did not deviate from [...] "the chunky, machine-like reliability" [...] which is present on the rest of Echo. Michael Cragg for musicOMH complimented the song for lifting Echos overall feel of being [...] "mundane", and that it is an [...] "obvious highlight" [...] of the album. He continued to write that the chorus is [...] "brilliantly camp" [...] and would be well suited to Kylie Minogue. Nate Chinen for The New York Times thought that Lewis was trying to show musical relevance with songs such as [...] "Outta My Head" [...] and [...] "Love Letter", but achieves it with mixed results. [...] "But Ms. Lewis strives for relevance here too, with mixed results. [...] "Love Letter" [...] is Kelly Clarkson without the spunk; [...] "Outta My Head" [...] is Lady Gaga without the smirk." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{tradition}} {{thus becomes}} master, {{it does so}} {{in such a way}} that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> we need not even understand.

After recounting the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the religious meaning of the kippah.

This was, therefore, a community which made decisions about the {{disposal of the dead}} based upon various factors, but at those we can barely guess. Was the inclusion of some but not all individuals subject to political control, or cultural screening? Was this a mark of ethnicity or did it represent a particular kinship, real or constructed, or the adherents of a particular cult? Was it status specific, with the rural proletariat – who would have been {{the vast majority of the}} population – perhaps excluded? So are many of these cemeteries associated with specific, high-status households and weighted particularly towards adult members? We do not know, but the commitment of particular parts of the community to an imported and in some senses 'Germanic', cremation ritual does seem to have been considerable, and <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> requires explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boys' love manga has {{received}} considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. Different critics and commentators have had very {{different views of}} BL. In 1983, Frederik L. Schodt, an American manga writer and translator, has observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in shoujo manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, {{as well as to}} create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects [...] "socially mandated" [...] gender roles as a [...] "first step toward feminism." [...] Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine [...] heterosexism <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> has consciously emerged {{as a result of the}} genre's popularity.|$|E
2500|$|Although Kaplický was {{a finalist}} for the Prince Philip Prize for {{designer}} of the year in 1991, for the first 15 years of its existence Future Systems received few commissions, and it was not until 1994 that the company was commissioned to build the new media centre at Lord's Cricket Ground which eventually won the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Stirling Prize – considered the most prestigious architecture award in the UK – in 1999 and the World Architecture Awards in 2001. Kaplický considered the media centre [...] "my favourite creation", saying, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> was revolutionary in many areas – a real technical achievement – but above all, the people operating inside it have said: 'We love it,' and that's great." [...] In 2000, he was made an Honourable Fellow of RIBA. Future Systems' next major project, the iconic Selfridges Building in the Bull Ring in Birmingham, won seven awards, including the RIBA Award for Architecture 2004.

2500|$|Summary on {{justice and}} charity, and the Church's role. The Church cannot and must not take upon herself the {{political}} battle {{to bring about}} the most just society possible. She cannot and must not replace the State. Yet {{at the same time she}} cannot and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice. She has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice, which always demands sacrifice, cannot prevail and prosper. [...] A just society must be the achievement of politics, not of the Church. Yet the promotion of justice through efforts to bring about openness of mind and will to the demands of the common good <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> concerns the Church deeply... The Church's charitable organizations, on the other hand, constitute an opus proprium, a task agreeable to her, in which she does not cooperate collaterally, but acts as a subject with direct responsibility, doing what corresponds to her nature.

[...] On July 18, 1908, Garrels also competed in the Greek discus, and again he did not place among the leaders. [...] Competing in his fourth event, Garrels took the silver medal in the 110-meter hurdles, finishing second behind fellow American Forrest Smithson who set a new world record with a time of 15.0 seconds. [...] Following Smithson's surprise victory over Garrels, one press account noted:"J. C.

2500|$|During World War II, Japanese Buddhist {{literature}} from that time, {{as part of}} its support of the Japanese war effort, stated [...] "In order to establish eternal peace in East Asia, arousing the great benevolence and compassion of Buddhism, we are sometimes accepting and sometimes forceful. We now {{have no choice but to}} exercise the benevolent forcefulness of 'killing one in order that many may live' (issatsu tashō). This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>which</b> Mahayana Buddhism approves of only with the greatest of seriousness..." [...] Almost all Japanese Buddhists temples strongly supported Japan's militarization. These were heavily criticized by the Chinese Buddhists of the era who disputed the validity of the statements made by those Japanese Buddhists supporters of the war. In response the Japanese Pan-Buddhist Society (Myowa Kai) rejected the criticism and stated that [...] "We now have no choice but to exercise the benevolent forcefulness of 'killing one in order that many may live' (issatsu tashō)" [...] and that the war was absolutely necessary to implement the dharma in Asia. The society re-examined more than 70 text written by Nichiren and re-edited his writings, making changes in 208 places, cutting all the statements that disagreed with the state Shinto. In contrast, a few Japanese Buddhists such as Ichikawa Haku and Seno’o Girō opposed this and were targeted. During the 1940s, [...] "leaders of the Honmon Hokkeshu and Soka Kyoiku Gakkai were imprisoned for their defiance of wartime government religious policy, which mandated display of reverence for the state Shinto".|$|E
