2500|$|In very {{narrowly}} defined situations, an employer {{is permitted to}} discriminate {{on the basis of}} a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide <b>occupational</b> <b>qualification</b> (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the bona fide <b>occupational</b> <b>qualifications</b> defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the [...] "essence" [...] or [...] "central mission of the employer's business", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., [...] 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide <b>Occupational</b> <b>Qualification</b> exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (Dothard v. Rawlinson, [...] 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide <b>Occupational</b> <b>Qualification</b> (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School — Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{emphasize}} the importance for every employer to avoid unfair discrimination during the recruitment process and to value diversity in the workplace. This is not only a legal requirement, but also gives an employer the best chance of getting the right person for the job. It is crucial to understand that job applicants are mostly people that employer’s do not actually employ, but might be able to make an unfair discrimination claim against the employer if the claimant believes he/she was not selected for a job because the employer discriminated against them unlawfully in the recruitment process. When writing the job description and a person specification, the employer should state clearly what tasks the person will have to execute and what skills will be needed for the job. Job descriptions should accurately describe the genuine essential duties and inherent requirements of the job. Personnel specifications should accurately describe the relevant, non-discriminatory and objectively justifiable requirements to be met by the post-holder. Specifications should not have any requirements that are not directly related to the job and it is important for employers to provide evidence that each recruitment and screening practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Employers are advised to devise and implement recruitment procedures and guidelines for all staff and applicants involved in the process of recruitment and to ensure that these incorporate the principles of the organisation’s equal opportunity principles. Employers should administer recruitment and other selection procedures without regard to race, colour, national origin, sex, religion, age and disability. Even though South Africa is now governed by a new democratic order, historical workplace inequalities still need to be addressed. Not only compelled to redress inequalities by the Constitution, the South African government was motivated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to enact laws that would prohibit discrimination and promote the economic advancement of the majority. Recruitment tests or selection procedures must be job-related and its results appropriate for the employer’s purpose. If a recruitment procedure screens out a protected group, the employer should determine whether there is an equally effective alternative selection procedure that has less adverse impact and, if so, adopt the alternative procedure. The justification of discrimination in recruitment practices and affirmative action is only meaningful if it is targeted towards particular aims. One of the more important defences against unfair discrimination in the workplace is the general fairness defence. The general fairness defence is considered to be an applicable defence based on fairness in situations where the two statutory exceptions do not apply. This means than when one looks at the concept of unfair discrimination it implies that discrimination may be justified in certain circumstances Legislation prohibits discrimination on various grounds especially throughout the process of recruitment and selection. There are limited exceptions to the general principle that it is unlawful to use gender, race, religion or sexual orientation as a criterion in the recruitment process. These exceptions are known as <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>qualifications</b> and the specifications for jobs should be carefully examined to ensure that there are no factors contained that are indirectly discriminatory. Focus must be placed on avoiding indirect discrimination in job factors. In the early stages of the recruitment process, an employee specification should be written that describes the type of person the employer seeks to be appointed in terms of qualifications, experience, skills and personal attributes. The imposition of inappropriate or unsuccessfully high standards or criteria may indirectly discriminate against people from a particular minority or racial group or religion. Employees must have the necessary skills to demand employment equity status especially where a designated employer does not have sufficient affirmative action employees and is obliged to rectify the situation. However, this does not mean that affirmative action applicants must be chosen above non-affirmative action employees. The principle of reversed discrimination stands firm if the motivation for appointing a particular person is based on a genuine desire to promote diversity, to apply affirmative action and to increase the numbers of people from a disadvantaged group in employment, or to create a more balanced workforce...|$|R
