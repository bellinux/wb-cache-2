5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without <b>external</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, {{the cause}} of republicanism was taken up in many countries, {{including}} the Kingdom of Ireland, at that time ruled by the Kingdom of Great Britain. Opposition to British rule had existed in Ireland for centuries, but the French example, combined with the imposition of the Penal Laws which discriminated against the Catholic majority and a large Presbyterian minority, prompted {{the creation of the}} Society of United Irishmen, a broad non-sectarian coalition of groups seeking to create an Irish Republic. Initially a non-violent political movement, the United Irishmen were forced to operate as a secret society after membership was made illegal in 1793 at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Deciding that their only hope of creating the Irish Republic lay in armed revolt, the United Irishmen began secretly organising and arming their forces. In search of <b>external</b> <b>aid,</b> two of their leaders, Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor travelled to Basle to meet with French General Lazare Hoche. Their efforts were supported by Protestant Dublin lawyer Theobald Wolfe Tone, who travelled to Paris to appeal to the French Directory in person. During this period, the British government repealed some of the Penal Laws, in an attempt to quell unrest.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed {{in the short}} time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases of trial and error until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this <b>external</b> <b>aid,</b> Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E

In two experiments, we examined the utility of <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> for facilitating air traffic management in a simulated air traffic control task with prospective memory requirements. Participants accepted and handed-off aircraft and detected aircraft conflicts. The prospective memory task involved remembering to deviate from a routine operating procedure when accepting target aircraft. <b>External</b> <b>aids</b> that contained details of the prospective memory task appeared and flashed when target aircraft needed acceptance. In Experiment 1, <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> presented either adjacent or nonadjacent {{to each of the}} 20 target aircraft presented over the 40 -min test phase reduced prospective memory error by 11 % compared with a condition without <b>external</b> <b>aids.</b> In Experiment 2, only a single target aircraft was presented a significant time (39 - 42 min) after presentation of the prospective memory instruction, and the <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> reduced prospective memory error by 34 %. In both experiments, costs to the efficiency of nonprospective memory air traffic management (nontarget aircraft acceptance response time, conflict detection response time) were reduced by nonadjacent aids compared with no aids or adjacent aids. In contrast, in both experiments, the efficiency of the prospective memory air traffic management (target aircraft acceptance response time) was facilitated by adjacent aids compared with nonadjacent aids. Together, these findings have potential implications for the design of automated alerting systems to maximize multitask performance in work settings where operators monitor and control demanding perceptual displays...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} children's problem solving strategies by testing the verbal and mathematical abilities of 52 second-grade and 51 fourth-grade students. After being identified as either reflective or impulsive, based on Kagan's Matching Familiar Figures Test, {{the children were}} given grade-appropriate mathematical and verbal reasoning problems to solve. The children then identified three types of strategies that they had used to solve the prcblems: (1) <b>external</b> <b>aids,</b> such as pencil and paper; (2) internal reasoning, such as visualizing the problem; and (3) retrieval, the immediate retrieval of an answer without any apparent effort. Results indicated that fourth-graders used a significantly greater proportion of <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> than did second-graders, and that reflective children generally adopted strategies that afforded them high confidence in accuracy, ones using <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> or internal reasoning. Reflective children also demonstrated more accuracy than impulsive children in solving both the math and verbal problems. Boys in both grades {{were more likely than}} girls to use internal reasoning on verbal problems, while girls were more likely than boys to use <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> on math problems. Overall, children preferred strategies requiring the most effort, suggesting that they are conservative in their strategy choices. (Contains 23 references.)

2500|$|Gandhi {{inherited}} a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal {{problems associated with}} the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. The government responded by taking steps to liberalize the economy, and by agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969. But, much of that growth was offset {{by the fact that the}} <b>external</b> <b>aid</b> promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalized economy, never materialized. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were straining due to Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought, at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb. In light of the circumstances, liberalization became politically suspect and was soon abandoned. Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India. After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future. Moreover, Gandhi's government resolved never again to become [...] "so vulnerably dependent" [...] on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves. When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, the government made it a point to use foreign exchange to buy US wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Introduction: Cognitive deficits, {{including}} executive dysfunction {{and memory}} impairment, {{are common in}} Parkinson’s disease (PD), and can increase difficulty of daily activities. While impairment-based cognitive treatments {{have been shown to}} improve scores on formal neuropsychological batteries, little to no research has focused on functional improvement or quality of life in individuals with PD. Methods: Three individuals with idiopathic PD underwent an eight-week <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> treatment program to help achieve personalized goals measured by Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), t-score analysis and descriptive measures, including questionnaires and interviews. A case series research design with baseline, post-intervention and 1 -month maintenance outcome measures was used to evaluate the research questions. Principles of systematic instruction were implemented to train the use of <b>external</b> <b>aids.</b> Results: All three participants improved in the majority of their GAS Lab and Home goals from baseline to immediately post-training and at a 1 -month maintenance assessment. Two participants demonstrated relatively stable goal attainment from post-treatment to the maintenance period; however, one participant demonstrated less stability. All participants also improved in the majority of their descriptive measures at post-treatment and at the one-month maintenance period. Discussion: This case series is the first study to examine an <b>external</b> <b>aids</b> treatment program for individuals with cognitive deficits secondary to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. The positive findings from this study suggests that external cueing may facilitate goal achievement in PD.
