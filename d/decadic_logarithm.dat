40|$|Estrogenic {{activity}} of diphenylethanes and -ethenes was detd. by uterine growth in immature mice and analyzed by weighed regression of logit-transformed effect on log dose values. This {{resulted in a}} range of Hill coeffs. nH from 0. 3 to 2 corresponding to the mol. mechanism of estrogenic transcriptional activation. Binding of agonists (hormones, H) to estrogen receptors (ER) leads to receptor dimerization depending on the structure of the ligand. Three hormone-receptor complexes, H-ER, H-ER-ER, and H-ER-ER-H, which bind with different affinity to short palindromic DNA sequences (estrogen responsive elements), can be proposed. Transcriptional activating functions of the DNA-bound ER are subsequently induced. The authors have derived an equil. model including these steps. Computer simulations of Hill plots based on the model have completely reproduced the range of obsd. nH values. Hill coeffs. are > 1. 5 if the homodimer H-ER-ER-H and < 0. 7 if the heterodimer H-Er-ER strongly predominates. If ER dimerization is disturbed (H-ER monomer predominant), nH is closer to 1. Hill coeffs. and pD 2 values (neg. <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithms</b> of molar estrogen doses causing 50 % of the maximal effects) are related to parameters of ER dimerization and the two steps of hormone-receptor dissocn. When a series of 1, 2 -bis(3 '- or 4 '-hydroxyphenyl) ethanes and -ethenes is studied, a rather simple dependence of nH and pD 2 on the nature of alkyl groups sym. substituted at C-atoms 1 and 2 can be obsd. In terms of the model this implies that Et and a-branched higher alkyl substituents (nH. mchgt. 1) appear to stabilize the homodimer, while Me and CF 3 groups (nH. mchlt. 1) could lead to a rapid dissocn. of the homodimer to the heterodimer. With longer n-alkyl and b-branched alkyl substitution (nH from 0. 66 to 1. 3), dimerization itself can be limited or the ligand-homodimer dissocn. is only moderately increased. Thus, a strong sterical constraint could exist with respect to the stabilization of the second ligand-receptor bond in the homodimer...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{hydraulic}} {{properties are}} needed as input data {{to describe and}} simulate the transport of water and solutes in the soil profile. Two main soil hydraulic properties, being commonly considered as soil’s fingerprints, are: 1. Soil-moisture retention curve (SMRC), which represents {{the amount of water}} remaining in the soil at equilibrium, expressed in terms of soil water content θ {{as a function of the}} soil water pressure head h (Hillel 1998, p. 155).

Saturated hydraulic conductivity K and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k as a func-tion of the soil water content or pressure head, k(θ) or k(h). The shape of SMRC is unique for each soil. It can be determined by direct measurements and is related to many other soil properties.

40|$|The use {{of special}} units for {{logarithmic}} ratio quantities is reviewed. The neper is {{used with a}} natural logarithm (logarithm to the base e) to express the logarithm of the amplitude ratio of two pure sinusoidal signals, particularly {{in the context of}} linear systems where it is desired to represent the gain or loss in amplitude of a single-frequency signal between the input and output. The bel, and its more commonly used submultiple, the decibel, are used with a <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithm</b> (logarithm to the base 10) to measure the ratio of two power-like quantities, such as a mean square signal or a mean square sound pressure in acoustics. Thus two distinctly different quantities are involved. In this review we define the quantities first, without reference to the units, as is standard practice in any system of quantities and units. We show that two different definitions of the quantity power level, or logarithmic power ratio, are possible. We show that this leads to two different interpretations for the meaning and numerical values of the units bel and decibel. We review the question of which of these alternative definitions is actually used, or is used by implication, by workers in the field. Finally, we discuss the relative advantages of the alternative definitions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{biopharmaceutical}} {{profile of}} a compound depends directly on the dissociation constants of its acidic and basic groups, commonly expressed as the negative <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithm</b> pK a of the acid dissociation constant (K a). The acid dissociation constant (also protonation or ionization constant) Ka is an equilibrium constant defined as {{the ratio of the}} protonated and the deprotonated formofacompound. ThepK a value of a compound strongly influences its pharmacokinetic and biochemical properties. Its accurate estimation is therefore of great interest in areas such as biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and drug development. Aside from the pharmaceutical industry, it also has relevance in environmental ecotoxicology, as well as the agrochemicals and specialty chemicals industries. In literature, a vast number of different approaches for pK a prediction can be found [1]. These approaches can be divided into two different classes. On the one hand there are direct calculations, so called ab initio methods, trying to determine the pK a value by quantum chemical or mechanical computation. On the other hand, statistical models, trained on chemical or structural descriptors. These descriptors can be, for example, of quantum chemical, semi empirical, graph topological or simple statistical nature. This type of modeling is called QSPR (Quantitative Structure Property Relationship). In our recent work, we develop such a QSPR model using localized molecular descriptors to train multiple linear regression and artificialneuralnetworkstoestimate dissociation constants (pKa). The performance of our approach {{is similar to that of}} a semi-empirical model based on frontier electron theory [2] as well as a prediction model based on Graph Kernels [3]. How such a prediction model can be built, is shown by an example performed with OCHEM, an online chemical database with an environment for modelin...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} {{of a significant}} amount coal in the United Kingdom has {{over the last four}} or so decades been made using opencast mining methods. This method involves large-scale excavation to reach the coal seams (with depths often exceeding 100 m). Following extraction various forms of restoration have been employed, including backfilling the mine void with material excavated in order to extract the coal. This backfilling was frequently undertaken in an uncontrolled fashion. In recent years it has been more usual to engineer the restoration such that further development of the site can take place. However, settlement remains the major obstacle to development. One mode of settlement commonly encountered on restored sites is creep settlement. Further, on older sites whose restoration was, most probably, undertaken in an uncontrolled way, the potential for creep settlement is the major obstacle. Creep settlement is understood to be that component of total settlement which, in a coarse granular soil, takes place under conditions of constant stress. It is generally accepted to occur linearly with the <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithm</b> of time. This study investigates the phenomenon from the visualisation of the granular particle mechanics. The technique used for the visualisations is computed tomography (CT), a technique which is common in medical diagnostics but has rarely been exploited in soil mechanics and never at the scale employed in the study. The use of CT supplements a programme of high quality, large scale laboratory testing, which models typical opencast coal mine backfill. The testing programme has revealed that compaction and the diagenesis of the source materials {{have a significant effect on}} the creep rate. Further, that the creep rate is defined m the most part by the aggregation of small or minor movements rather being dominated by large or major movements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibiotic {{treatment}} of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children remains mostly empirical because clinical and paraclinical findings poorly discriminate the principal causes of CAP. Fast response to beta-lactam treatment {{can be considered}} a proxy of pneumococcal aetiology. We aimed to identify the best biological predictor of response to beta-lactam therapy in children hospitalized for CAP. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre cohort study included all consecutive patients 1 month to 16 years old hospitalized in a teaching hospital in Paris, France, because of CAP empirically treated with a beta-lactam alone from 2003 to 2010. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to study the ability of routine biological parameters available in the Emergency Department to predict a favourable response to beta-lactam (defined as apyrexia within 48 hours of treatment onset). RESULTS: Among the 125 included patients, 85 % (106) showed a favourable response to beta-lactam. In multivariate logistic regression, we found procalcitonin (PCT) the only independent predictor of apyrexia (p = 0. 008). The adjusted odds ratio for the <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithm</b> of PCT was 4. 3 (95 % CI 1. 5 - 12. 7). At ≥ 3 ng/mL, PCT had 55. 7 % sensitivity (45. 7 - 65. 3), 78. 9 % specificity (54. 4 - 93. 9), 93. 7 % positive predictive value (84. 5 - 98. 2), 24. 2 % negative predictive value (14. 2 - 36. 7), 2. 64 positive likelihood ratio (1. 09 - 6. 42) and 0. 56 negative likelihood ratio (0. 41 - 0. 77). In the 4 children with a PCT level ≥ 3 ng/mL and who showed no response to beta-lactam treatment, secondary pleural effusion had developed in 3, and viral co-infection was documented in 1. CONCLUSIONS: PCT is the best independent biologic predictor of favourable response to beta-lactam therapy in children hospitalized for CAP. Thus, a high PCT level is highly suggestive of pneumococcal aetiology. However, a 3 -ng/mL cut-off does not seem compatible with daily medical practice, and additional research is needed to further define the role of PCT in managing CAP in children...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the Human Genome Project by adding detail to the physical and genetic maps of the human genome, and by identifying a strong candidate gene for a form of distal myopathy. Genomic clones for the human skeletal muscle genes slow troponin (TNN/ 1), alpha actin (ACTA 1), and (3 -tropomyosin (TPM 2) were isolated {{for use in the}} fluorescent in situ hybridisation localisation of these genes on the cytogenetic map of the human genome. The localisation of these genes made them potential candidates for inherited skeletal muscle diseases, including the muscular dystrophies investigated here. Microsatellite, VNTR and RFLP markers were used in a search for linkage to a novel form of distal myopathy segregating in a Western Australian family. The <b>decadic</b> <b>logarithm</b> of the likelihood ratio, or 2 ̆ 7 lod score 2 ̆ 7 method, was used to determine linkage between markers and this distal myopathy gene. A 22. 4 cM candidate region was identified at 14 q 11. 2. This was the first localisation of a distal myopathy gene. The Human Genome Organisation Nomenclature Committee reserved MPD 1, 2 ̆ 7 myopathy, distal 1 2 ̆ 7, for this form of distal myopathy, now known as Laing myopathy. The MPD 1 candidate region was excluded as the disease gene location for two other forms of distal myopathy. Silburn myopathy in 1994, which established the genetic heterogeneity of distal myopathy, and Felice myopathy in 1996. The exclusion of the MPD 1 and French-Canadian OPMD candidate regions as disease gene locations for a putative-OPMD segregating in a Western Australian family, proved that this disease gene did not lie at 14 q 11. 2. Testing an MPD 1 muscle-specific candidate gene for the Laing myopathy mutation, the myosin heavy polypeptide 7 gene (MYH 7), identified seven base changes between the MPD 1 proband sequence and the published MYH 7 eDNA sequence. All of these base changes were found in eight unrelated, unaffected Western Australians, therefore none of them were the Laing myopathy mutation. Two further differences to the published MYH 7 sequence segregated exclusively with the MPD 1 proband. One of these, the MYH 7 G 5073 C (cDNA) /G 23628 C (gDNA) base change, caused a critical change to the MYH 7 13 -myosin heavy chain polypeptide product (13 -MyHC). An A 1663 P 13 -MyHC substitution. G 23628 /C 23628 segregated with Laing myopathy in the Western Australian distal myopathy family. This segregation was confirmed by a single-strand conformation polymorphism test, then used to test 256 unaffected chromosomes. None possessed MYH 7 C 23628. Two patients from European distal myopathy families phenotypically similar to Laing myopathy, the Voit and Scoppetta families, were tested for the presence of MYH 7 gDNA G 23628 /C 23628 heterozygosity. Both were homozygous MYH 7 G 23628. One of these patients (Voit) was also tested for MYH 7 eDNA G 5073 /C 5073 heterozygosity. She was homozygous MYH 7 G 5073. An analysis of the effect of the 13 -MyHC A 1663 P substitution at various levels of protein structure strengthened the candidature of MYH 7 G 5073 C as the Laing myopathy mutation. It demonstrated the extreme rarity of the 13 -MyHC A 1663 P substitution; it showed that this substitution did have a detrimental effect on coiled-coil formation; and it identified ways in which the 13 -MyHC A 1663 P substitution could disrupt myofibrillogenesis or contractility. Future research directions are identified and the contribution of this work to evolving concepts in muscular dystrophy is evaluated...|$|E
