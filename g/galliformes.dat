5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in <b>Galliformes</b> (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{spectrophotometric}} {{evidence suggests}} that turacoverdin may be closely related or identical to green pigments in the feathers of the northern jacana (Jacana spinosa), the blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), and the crested wood-partridge (Rollulus rouloul). As Ithaginis and Rollulus {{are members of the}} order <b>Galliformes,</b> this has led some researchers to assume support for a turacoverdin-bearing common ancestor of Musophagidae and <b>Galliformes,</b> making the presence of the pigment a symplesiomorphy for these groups. The pigment data specifically suggests that turacos evolved from a group of galliform species, which is represented by the extant genera Ithaginis and Rollolus. Based on the appearance of its green feathers, researcher Jan Dyck speculates that Rollolus is closer to a possible ancestor than Ithaginis.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} jacana, on {{the other}} hand, {{is a member of}} the order Charadriiformes, a group clearly not closely related to either Musophagidae or <b>Galliformes.</b> This makes it highly unlikely that turacoverdin in Jacana reflects common ancestry with either turacos or galliforms. If the green pigment in Jacana is truly turacoverdin, then the pigment must have evolved independently in this order. This is further supported by the fact that the pigment in Jacana is located only in the remiges, while in all musophagid and galliform species, the pigment is found mainly in body feathers.|$|E

50|$|Final Fantasy Explorers is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. The player starts {{the game on}} an island featuring various locations, but can access other areas beyond the island on foot. The main goal of the player is to collect crystals scattered across the world. Unlike other narrative-driven entries in the Final Fantasy series, Explorers follows a quest-driven structure similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Capcom's Monster Hunter series. Quest difficulty can be manually adjusted. Unlike previous entries in the series, chocobos, a recurring <b>galliforme</b> bird in the series, will not be available for riding. Player characters engage in fights with classic Final Fantasy enemies and summons including Ifrit and Bahamut.|$|R

25|$|Throughout its range, {{small rodents}} (mice, voles, and rats) are the wildcat's primary prey, {{followed}} by birds (especially ducks and other waterfowl, <b>galliformes,</b> pigeons and passerines), dormice, hares, nutria, and insectivores. Unlike the housecat, the wildcat can consume large fragments of bone without ill-effect. Although it kills insectivores, such as moles and shrews, it rarely eats {{them because of}} the pungent scent glands on their flanks. When living close to human habitations, the wildcat can be a serious poultry predator. In the wild, the wildcat consumes up to 600grams of food daily.|$|E
25|$|The Anseriformes and the <b>Galliformes</b> (pheasants, etc.) are {{the most}} {{primitive}} neognathous birds, and should follow ratites and tinamous in bird classification systems.

25|$|Tinamous are {{exclusively}} neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The {{range of}} the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean tinamous have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, {{and in particular the}} Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. Tinamous form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the <b>Galliformes</b> ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. Rheas are only found in open country, curassows and guans are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.|$|E

40|$|Avian haemophili demonstrating {{in vitro}} satellitic growth, also {{referred}} to as the V-factor or NAD requirement, have mainly been classified with Avibacterium paragallinarum (Haemophilus paragallinarum), Avibacterium avium (Pasteurella avium), Avibacterium volantium (Pasteurella volantium) and Avibacterium sp. A (Pasteurella species A). The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the taxonomic position of 18 V-factor-requiring isolates of unclassified Haemophilus-like organisms isolated from <b>galliforme,</b> anseriforme, columbiforme and gruiforme birds as well as kestrels and psittacine birds including budgerigars by conventional phenotypic tests and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. All isolates shared phenotypical characteristics which allowed classification with Pasteurellaceae. Haemolysis of bovine red blood cells was negative. Haemin (X-factor) was not required for growth. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis including bootstrap analysis showed that six isolates were related to the avian 16 S rRNA group and were classified as Avibacterium according to 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. Surprisingly, the other 12 isolates were unrelated to Avibacterium. Two isolates were unrelated to any of the known 16 S rRNA groups of Pasteurellaceae. Two isolates were related to Volucribacter of the avian 16 S rRNA group. Seven isolates belonged to the Testudinis 16 S rRNA group and out of these, two isolates were closely related to taxa 14 and 32 of Bisgaard, whereas four other isolates were found to form a genus-like group distantly related to taxon 40 and one isolated remained distantly related to other members of the Testudinis group. One isolate was closely related to taxon 26 (a member of Actinobacillus sensu stricto). The study documented major genetic diversity among V-factor-requiring avian isolates beyond the traditional interpretation that they only belong to Avibacterium, underlining the limited value of satellitic growth for identification of avian members of Pasteurellaceae. Our study also emphasized that these organisms will never be isolated without the use of special media satisfying the V-factor requirement...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{long-lived}} iteroparous {{species has}} shown that reproductive success may increase with age, until the onset of senescence, and that prior reproductive success may influence current reproductive success. Such complex reproductive dynamics can complicate conservation strategies, especially for harvested species. Further complicating the matter {{is the fact that}} most studies of reproductive costs are only able to evaluate a single measure of reproductive effort. We systematically evaluated the effects of climatic variation and reproductive trade-offs on multiple reproductive vital rates for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), a relatively long-lived <b>galliforme</b> of conservation concern throughout western North America. Based on over a decade of field observations, we hypothesized that reproduction is influenced by previous reproductive success. We monitored hen reproductive activity from 1998 to 2010, and used generalized linear mixed models to assess effects of climate and previous reproductive success on subsequent reproductive success. Reproductive trade-offs manifested as chronic effects on subsequent reproduction and were not apparent in all measures of subsequent reproduction. Neither nest initiation nor clutch size were found to be affected by climatic variables (either year t - 1 or t) or previous reproductive success. However, both nest and brood success were affected by climatic variation and previous reproductive success. Nest success was highest in years with high spring snowpack, and was negatively related to previous brood success. Brood success was positively influenced by moisture in April, negatively associated with previous nest success, and positively influenced by previous brood success. Both positive and negative effects of previous reproduction on current year reproduction were observed, possibly indicating high levels of individual heterogeneity in female reproductive output. Our results support previous research in indicating that climatic variability may have significant negative impacts on reproductive rates...|$|R
25|$|More recently, it {{has become}} clear that the Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the <b>Galliformes</b> are the most ancient groups of modern birds. It is possible, though not at all well-supported, that these were {{distinct}} {{by the end of the}} Albian 100 million years ago (Ma). Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both species were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups are not that closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong that even the most modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.|$|E
