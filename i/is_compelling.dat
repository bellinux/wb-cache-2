5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane toads on the {{northern}} quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the local extinction of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.|$|E

25|$|Though López García {{is devoted}} to the mundane—he depicts humble people, buildings, plants, and {{cluttered}} interiors—his portrayal of these subjects <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> and beautiful. Starkly lit studies of his studio, bathroom, and the red brick wall in his backyard underscore an interest in prosaic subject matter. His deftness brings attention to these simple forms, encouraging the viewer to re-examine the presence of ordinary objects.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> {{evidence}} that George Stinney was innocent {{of the crimes}} {{for which he was}} executed in 1944. The prosecutor relied, almost exclusively, on one piece of evidence to obtain a conviction in this capital case: the unrecorded, unsigned “confession” of a 14-year-old child who was deprived of counsel and parental guidance, and whose defense lawyer shockingly failed to call exculpating witnesses or to preserve his right of appeal.|$|E

25|$|The current superdominance of Eucalyptus in Australia {{may be an}} {{artefact}} {{of human}} influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of {{a dramatic increase in}} the abundance of Eucalyptus pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels. Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus.|$|E
25|$|Investigators do {{not qualify}} {{aircraft}} incidents as suicide unless there <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> {{evidence that the}} pilot was doing so. This evidence would include suicide notes, previous attempts, threats of suicide, or a history of mental illness. In a study of pilot suicides from 2002-2013, eight cases were identified as definite suicides, with five additional cases of undetermined cause {{that may have been}} suicides. Investigators may also work with terrorism experts, checking for links to extremist groups to try to determine whether the suicide was an act of terrorism.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> {{evidence}} that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS sensitization process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization. In addition, there is experimental {{evidence that}} demonstrates NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, {{it has also been}} hypothesized that a variety of immune processes may contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all concepts that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.|$|E

25|$|While {{evidence}} such as {{size and}} scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) <b>is</b> <b>compelling,</b> {{developments in the}} Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by 14C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still {{the most widely used}} absolute dating method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or Long Count-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.|$|E

Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars, and the lack of speed in the music, combined with the monotony of the sound. Seward felt that the album [...] "is not 'heavy' music in the least, if we’re talking volume and crunch", but that [...] "it is 'heavy' music if we’re talking about the end product: a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor".|$|E
500|$|Betrayal {{received}} mixed-to-positive reception, including {{praise for}} its {{fidelity to the}} series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics. Levi Buchanan of IGN called it [...] "the real deal third game in the killer franchise". Similarly, Matt Paprocki of Blogcritics wrote, [...] "Betrayal is a full-fledged extension of the God of War franchise, and it earns its title". He said it is [...] "one of the best mobile games you’ll ever play, and has truly made the format a relevant part of the current video game scene." [...] In regards to violence, Chris Antista of GamesRadar stated that it is [...] "quite possibly the goriest thing your mobile's ever seen". Although not a [...] "revolutionary experience", Pocket Gamers Will Freeman said [...] "it is a thoroughly impressive, utterly solid release that mobile platform fans will relish."

500|$|Polly Shulman of The New York Times finds Quicksilver hard {{to follow}} and amazingly complex {{but a good}} read. However she notes that the {{complicated}} and clunky dialogue between the characters is a distraction. [...] She thinks a full appreciation {{of the work is}} only possible {{within the context of the}} remaining novels of The Baroque Cycle, and compares the novel to works by Dorothy Dunnett, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, calling it [...] "history-of-science fiction". In the post-publication review for The New York Times, Edward Rothstein remarks that the scope of the novel is at times detrimental: [...] "Unfortunately, in this novelistic cauldron it can sometimes seem as if mercury's vapors had overtaken the author himself, as if every detail he had learned had to be anxiously crammed into his text, while still leaving the boundaries between fact and invention ambiguous". He considers the novel to be an [...] "experiment in progress", although the historical background <b>is</b> <b>compelling.</b>|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the release}} of the second season, Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters said the first season of Dark Angel was one of the [...] "few straight-up successes, a ratings hit among the coveted 'youth' demographic." [...] She praised the series but clarified: [...] "I'm not getting carried away: Jim Cameron {{is not going to be}} making revolutionary art anytime soon." [...] Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that [...] "for a while [...] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine". Elka Karl of Common Sense Media gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: [...] "While the {{dialogue}} sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it <b>is</b> <b>compelling</b> television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy." [...] While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of TVOvermind labelled the second season [...] "silly", criticizing [...] "dumb stories" [...] like Max's dream episode [...] "Boo", the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.|$|E
500|$|Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times called [...] "Scream" [...] {{the best}} {{song on the}} album. He continued, [...] "The refrain of [...] "Stop pressurin' me!" [...] <b>is</b> <b>compelling,</b> and he spits out the lyrics with drama and purpose. The song has bite and {{infectious}} energy." [...] MacDonald did, however, consider the use of profanity unnecessary. Deepika Reddy of The Daily Collegian wrote, [...] "The lyrics to the album's debut single and video 'Scream' are {{for the first time}} in Jackson's convoluted career, painfully direct. He sings 'Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/It makes me want to scream' with a force and resentment that's new and surpassing." [...] "'Scream' and 'Tabloid Junkie' have a raw aspect that Jackson hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean.'" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post, however, called it [...] "dull and musically uninvolved." [...] He was also of the opinion that it sounded like [...] "Jam" [...] from 1991, thus dated. [...] "Scream" [...] was nominated for [...] "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" [...] at the 1996 American Music Awards, and shortly afterward it gained a Grammy nomination for [...] "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls her tone [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] <b>is</b> <b>compelling,</b> and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".|$|E
