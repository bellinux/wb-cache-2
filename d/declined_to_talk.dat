5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the documentary, Smith's mother raised the question of responsibility: [...] "Who gave that order, Hana?... Who gave the order to keep that child, we're talking about a child in the youth centre, segregated that length of time? Who gave the order 'don't intervene' if she's still breathing?" [...] The four guards saw the charges against them dropped and were reinstated to their positions; they <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to The Fifth Estate. The Corrections Service of Canada viewed the case as closed, and while the current minister did talk to Hana Gartner, CSC refused any interviews with the reporter, while a lawsuit was pending.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{a set of}} {{pictures}} showing Padukone kissing the actor Siddharth Mallya at an Indian Premier League match were made available on the web. This led to wide speculation in the media {{about the nature of}} their relationship, which Padukone <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about publicly. The following year there were reports about a break-up, to which she said: [...] "Just because we are not seen together, it doesn't mean that we are not friends anymore."

25|$|An {{interesting}} feature, {{compared to}} other Danish parties, is that the Danish People's Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls. Election researchers {{have suggested that the}} party's voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> pollsters, or that voters are reluctant to reveal their support for the party to pollsters.|$|R
50|$|In summer 2005 {{it emerged}} that former JEG {{chairman}} John Jarvis was taking {{legal action against}} Westlin, to regain ownership of Ikonboard amongst other things. During much of September that year the sites' server was down. Westlin <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> comment on the outage, prompting several staff members to quit. In October 2005, with Westlin still <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the support staff and developers, Ikonboard releases were no longer available for download.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2009 Karzai {{announced}} {{to move ahead}} with a Loya Jirga (large assembly) to discuss the Taliban insurgency in which the Taliban representatives would be invited {{to take part in}} this Jirga. In January 2010, Karzai set the framework for dialogue with Taliban leaders when he called on the group's leadership {{to take part in the}} jirga to initiate peace talks. A Taliban spokesman <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in detail about Karzai's offer and only said the militants would make a decision soon. In April 2010, Karzai urged Taliban insurgents to lay down their arms and air their grievances while visiting a violent northern province, adding that foreign forces would not leave the country as long as fighting continued. In July 2010, Karzai approved a plan intended to win over Taliban foot soldiers and low-level commanders. [...] In mid-August 2013, Attorney General Mohammad Ishaq Aloko was said to have been fired after meeting with Taliban officials in the U.A.E. after being told not to meet with them. However, unnamed senior cabinet officials tried to persuade Karzai to not fire him, while an official in Aloko's office denied the dismissal saying instead that he was at the Presidential Palace [...] "celebrating Independence Day." ...|$|E

50|$|Michael {{attempts}} {{to apologize to}} Holly, but she <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> He has her join Kevin and Creed in his office so he can apologize {{to the two of}} them, simultaneously apologizing to Holly indirectly.

5000|$|Anita confronts Barney {{at the bar}} for {{not showing}} up on their own date and is flustered that he uses her own [...] "No" [...] {{strategy}} against her. Barney is defiant and Anita offers him multiple compromise offers, the last of which prompts him to march {{out of the bar}} and jump into the Hudson River {{in an effort to keep}} his promise to Robin. Barney is later fined $500 for the misdemeanor and watches fireworks meant to cap off the super date, while Don and Robin kiss watching them. Robin <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the gang about the date the following morning, but later breaks into the [...] "bang, bang, bang, bangity-bang" [...] song, with everyone except Barney joining in.|$|R

A beautifully constructed borshch, such {{as you are}} going to experience presently, ought not only to banish conversation but almost to annihilate thought. Later on, when we arrive at the second stage of olives, I shall be quite ready to discuss that new book on Borrow, or, if you prefer it, the present situation in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. But I absolutely <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> anything approaching business till we have finished with the bird.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mowbray's face hardened. The intruding fellow had insolently <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{over any}} but the {{material}} benefits to be expected. It {{looked as if}} he attached no importance to his opinions; and in one respect Mowbray was not mistaken. Harding had ideas of progress, mutual help, and good fellowship with which he did not expect the Colonel to sympathize.|$|E
60|$|Psmith {{pushed back}} his chair slightly, {{stretched}} out his legs, and lit a cigarette. The resources of the Knickerbocker Hotel had proved equal to supplying the fatigued staff of Cosy Moments with an excellent dinner, and Psmith had stoutly <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> business until the coffee arrived. This had been hard on Billy, who was bursting with his news. Beyond a hint that it was sensational {{he had not been}} permitted to go.|$|E
6000|$|The Prince sat side by {{side with}} Lady Grace, the other two {{occupants}} of the car being the Duke himself and Mr. Haviland. No one seemed in the least inclined for conversation. The Duke and Mr. Haviland exchanged a few remarks, but Lady Grace, leaning back in her seat, her features completely obscured by a thick veil, <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to any one. The Prince seemed to be the only one who made any pretence at enjoying the beauty of the spring morning, who seemed even {{to be aware of the}} warm west wind, the occasional perfume of the hedgeside violets, and the bluebells which stretched like a carpet in and out of the belts of wood. Lady Grace's eyes, from beneath her veil, scarcely once left his face. Perhaps, she thought, these things were merely allegorical to him. Perhaps his eyes, fixed so steadfastly upon the distant horizon, were not, as it seemed, following the graceful outline of that grove of dark green pine trees, but were indeed searching back into the corners of his life, measuring up the good and evil of it, asking the eternal question--was it worth while? ...|$|E

In an interview with Johnson, Ann Donahue from Billboard described Johnson's family life by saying [...] "There is often trouble in balancing {{the life of an}} artist, environmentalist, and family man, but Johnson seems to have the niche for such a challenge. This time around, he's found a pace that agrees with him…bringing his family along so he can spend mornings with them sightseeing." [...] Both Johnson and his wife <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about or release any intimate information concerning their children.|$|R
50|$|Quentin {{believes}} {{each person}} has a reason for being there. Leaven is a mathematics student, Holloway a physician and conspiracy theorist, and the surly Worth <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about himself. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap. They find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. When Quentin nearly dies in a room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, tensions rise due to personality conflicts and lack of faith in Leaven's system. Quentin provokes Worth into an argument about finding the exit, and Worth accidentally reveals that he has knowledge of the Cube. Worth admits that he designed the Cube's outer shell for a shadowy bureaucracy and guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within simply to put it to use.|$|R
500|$|Before {{the actor}} turned 18, his sexualized image was often critiqued, {{and subject to}} controversy. In December 2009, Lautner {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone in a wet T-shirt. Jennifer Cady of E! Online said to wait a few months when Lautner would [...] "be of age, which will make this whole operation you got going on completely legal." [...] In his interview with the magazine, after <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about whether he was dating Taylor Swift, the magazine pressed Lautner on rumors of him being homosexual, which he brushed off. Brent Hartinger, a columnist for AfterElton, blasted the magazine, calling the questioning [...] "unimaginably irresponsible," [...] commenting that Lautner was just [...] "a 17-year old kid" [...] and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans, it was disappointing that a [...] "legitimate media outlet" [...] would print gossip. Hartinger said the magazine reached a [...] "new low" [...] and did not have common decency, noting that the line between child and adult [...] "is there for a good reason".|$|R

However, in the private correspondence between them, Belopopski disclosed details about a visithis father made while he resided in London in 1964. His dad brought him some lukanka from Bulgaria. Belopopski tossed the lukanka in the street where it was eaten by a dog, which became violently sick immediately, and died.|$|R

Albert Bormann also refused to cooperate, in this case because of family {{connections}} (he was Martin Bormann's brother). Other people who had been close to Hitler in the final days, most notably Ambassador Walther Hewel, committed suicide after the break-out.

60|$|Beside this warm {{feeling and}} {{exquisite}} taste, {{which made him}} so delightful a guide, his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted on them,--some tradition, some incident, some connection with his own poetry, or himself, or some dear friend. These he brought out in a striking way. Apart from these, he was well pleased to discourse on poetry or poets; and here appeared {{to me to be}} his principal scholarship. He was extremely well read in English poetry; and he would in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and fairness. He did not intrude his own poetry or himself, but he did not <b>decline</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about either; and he spoke of both simply, unboastingly, and yet with a manly consciousness of their worth. It was clear he thought he had achieved a high place among poets: it had been the aim of his life, humanly speaking; and he had taken worthy pains to accomplish and prepare himself for the enterprise. He never would sacrifice anything he thought right on reflection, merely to secure present popularity, or avert criticism which he thought unfounded; but he was a severe critic on himself, and would not leave a line or an expression with which he was dissatisfied until he had brought it to what he liked. He thought this due to the gift of poetry and the character of the poet. Carelessness in the finish of composition he seemed to look on almost as an offence. I remember well, that after speaking with love and delight of a very popular volume of poetry, he yet found great fault with the want of correctness and finish. Reciting one of the poems, and pointing out inaccuracies in it, he said, 'I like the volume so much, that, if I was the author, I think I should never rest till I had nearly rewritten it.' No doubt he carried this in his own case to excess, when he corrected so largely, in the decline of life, poems written in early manhood, under a state of feelings and powers which it was impossible to reproduce, and yet which was necessary, generally speaking, for successful alteration. I cannot but agree with many who think that on this account the earlier copies of his poems are more valuable than the later.|$|R
