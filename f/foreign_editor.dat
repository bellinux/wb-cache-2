25|$|Responding {{to these}} accusations, a Guardian {{editorial}} in 2002 condemned anti-Semitism and defended the paper's right to criticise {{the policies and}} actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken. Harriet Sherwood, then The Guardian's <b>foreign</b> <b>editor,</b> later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied that The Guardian has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before Maxwell's death, {{a former}} {{employee}} of Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate intelligence agency, Ari Ben-Menashe, had approached a number of news organisations in Britain and the United States with the allegation that Maxwell and the Daily Mirror's <b>foreign</b> <b>editor,</b> Nicholas Davies, were both long-time agents for Mossad. Ben-Menashe also claimed that in 1986 Maxwell had told the Israeli Embassy in London that Mordechai Vanunu had given information about Israel's nuclear capability to the Sunday Times, then to the Daily Mirror. Vanunu was subsequently kidnapped by Mossad and smuggled to Israel, convicted of treason and imprisoned for 18 years.|$|E
25|$|The period 1909 to 1913 saw the {{emergence}} of Imagism, the first consciously avant garde movement in 20th century English-language poetry. Pound, who was Imagism's prime mover, served as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor</b> of Harriet Monroe's magazine Poetry. In October 1912, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Richard Aldington under the label Imagiste. Aldington's poems were printed in the November issue, and H.D.'s appeared in the January 1913 issue. The March 1913 issue of Poetry also contained Pound's A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste and F. S. Flint's essay Imagisme. This publication history meant that this London-based movement had its first readership in the United States. It also meant that Imagism was available {{as a model for}} American Modernist poets of the next generation.|$|E

500|$|The protests did not garner any Presidential {{sympathy for}} the journalists, but instead {{resulted}} in trouble from their media employers. UPI's Tokyo office criticised Sheehan for trying to [...] "make Unipress policy" [...] on his own when [...] "Unipress must be neutral, neither pro-Diem, pro-Communist or pro-anybody else". Emanuel Freedman, the <b>foreign</b> <b>editor</b> of The New York Times reprimanded Halberstam, writing: [...] "We still feel that our correspondents should not be firing off cables to the President of the United States without authorization." ...|$|E
500|$|When Harriet Monroe {{started her}} Poetry {{magazine}} in 1911, {{she had asked}} Pound to act as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor.</b> In October 1912, he submitted thereto three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the Imagiste rubric,( [...] published in the November 1912 second issue thereof [...] ) with [...] a note which described Aldington as ' one of the 'Imagistes'. This note, along with the appendix note('The Complete Works of T. S. Hulme') in Pound's book (also [...] published in Autumn [...] 1912) entitled Ripostes are considered [...] to be first appearances [...] of the word Imagiste(later anglicised [...] to 'Imagists') in print.|$|E
500|$|During {{a meeting}} with H.D. in a tea room near the British Museum that year, Pound {{appended}} the signature H.D. Imagiste to her poetry, creating a label that was {{to stick to the}} poet for most of her writing life. However H.D. told different versions of this story at various times, and during her career published under a variety of pseudonyms. That same year, Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine and asked Pound to act as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor.</b> In October, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the rubric Imagiste. Aldington's poems were in the November issue of Poetry and H.D.'s poems [...] "Hermes of the Ways," [...] "Orchard," [...] and [...] "Epigram," [...] in the January 1913 issue. Imagism as a movement was launched with H.D. as its prime exponent.|$|E

500|$|In 1919 he {{published}} {{a collection of}} his essays for The Little Review as Instigations, and in the March 1919 issue Poetry, {{he published}} Poems from the Propertius Series, which {{appeared to be a}} translation of the Latin Poet Sextus Propertius. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it Homage to Sextus Propertius in response to criticism of his translation skills. [...] "Propertius" [...] is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as [...] "the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence". Harriet Monroe, editor of Poetry, published a letter from a professor of Latin, W. G. Hale, saying that Pound was [...] "incredibly ignorant" [...] of the language, and alluded to [...] "about three-score errors" [...] in Homage. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began [...] "Cat-piss and porcupines!!" [...] and continued, [...] "The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than Fitzgerald's Omar is a translation". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1820s, Willis began {{contributing}} more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor for the gift book The Token, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich. That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine, which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the [...] "tight purses of Boston culture" [...] and moved to Europe to serve as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor</b> and correspondent of the New York Mirror. In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer. Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the Mirror, about half of which were later collected as Pencillings by the Way, printed in London in 1835. The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.|$|E
500|$|Pound {{worked in}} London {{during the early}} 20th century as <b>foreign</b> <b>editor</b> of several American {{literary}} magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway. Angered by the carnage of World War I, Pound lost faith in England and blamed the war on usury and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924, and throughout the 1930s and 1940s he embraced Benito Mussolini's fascism, expressed support for Adolf Hitler, and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist Oswald Mosley. During World War II, he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Jews, {{as a result of}} which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of treason. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in Pisa, including three weeks in a [...] outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: [...] "when the raft broke and the waters went over me". Deemed unfit to stand trial, he was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.|$|E
