50|$|Despite {{being well}} described, the {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for the}} evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles are largely unknown. Discontinuous gas exchange cycles have long been thought to be an adaptation to conserve water when living in a terrestrial environment (the <b>hygric</b> hypothesis). However, recent studies question the <b>hygric</b> hypothesis, and several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. For discontinuous gas exchange cycles to be considered adaptive, the origin and subsequent persistence of the trait must be demonstrated to be a result of natural selection.|$|E
50|$|Following work on {{harvester}} ants in 1995, doctors John Lighton and David Berrigan {{proposed the}} chthonic hypothesis. It was observed that many insects that demonstrate discontinuous gas exchange cycles {{are exposed to}} hypoxia (low O2 levels) and hypercapnia (high CO2 levels) by spending {{at least part of}} their life cycle in enclosed spaces underground. Lighton and Berrigan hypothesized that discontinuous gas exchange cycles may be an adaptation to maximize partial pressure gradients between an insect’s respiratory system and the environment in which it lives. Alternatively, insects could obtain enough O2 by opening their spiracles for extended periods of time. However, unless their environment is very humid, water will be lost from the respiratory system to the environment. Discontinuous gas exchange cycles, therefore, may limit water loss while facilitating O2 consumption and CO2 removal in such environments. Many researchers describe this theory as the chthonic-hygric hypothesis and consider it to support the <b>hygric</b> hypothesis. However, others emphasize the importance of maximizing partial pressure gradients alone and consider the chthonic hypothesis to be distinct from the <b>hygric</b> hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hygric</b> {{hypothesis}} was first proposed in 1953, {{making it the}} earliest posed hypothesis {{for the evolution of}} discontinuous gas exchange. The <b>hygric</b> hypothesis proposes that the discontinuous release of CO2 is an adaptation that allows terrestrial insects to limit respiratory water loss to the environment. This hypothesis is supported by studies that have demonstrated that respiratory water loss is substantially higher in insects forced to keep their spiracles open, than those of the same species who exhibit discontinuous gas exchange. In addition, laboratory selection experiments on Drosophila melanogaster have shown that more variable gas exchange patterns can emerge in populations of insects artificially selected for tolerance to dry conditions. However, water loss during discontinuous gas exchange is only limited during the flutter phase if gas exchange during the flutter phase is convective (or assisted by muscular contraction). From a water conservation perspective, if ventilation during the flutter phase occurs entirely by simple diffusion, there is no benefit to having a flutter phase. This has led to the belief that some other factor {{may have contributed to the}} evolution of discontinuous gas exchange in insects.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{deviating}} <b>hygric</b> behaviour of mortar joints, {{based on a}} combination of <b>hygric</b> property measurements, numerical simulations, sharp-front analysis and microscopic imaging. Comparison of the <b>hygric</b> properties of mould and joint mortars reveals significant differences. Further analysis with numerical simulations indicates however that an interface resistance must be attributed to the brick-mortar bond plane, which is further corroborated by sharp-front analysis of free water uptake in masonry samples. While the deviating <b>hygric</b> behaviour of mortar joints previously has been ascribed to <b>hygric</b> property changes or interface resistances, the current study points out that both are at play, and it demonstrates the influence of the curing conditions on these phenomena. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{showed that}} moisture buffering characterisation of finishing materi-als, as aimed {{at in the}} Nordtest-project and in the Japanese Industrial Standard, is only useful {{if there is a}} close agreement between indoor conditions in the room and impo-sed boundary conditions in the test protocol. Furthermore, until now the test protocols only classify finishing materials but the obtained values can not be used as design tool. In this paper the Moisture Buffer Value (MBV) as defined in the Nordtest-project is ela-borated to account for the mismatch between realistic boundary conditions and the loa-ding protocol of the test procedure. Numerical simulations on fourteen interior claddings show that the adapted MBV * gives a far more reliable assessment of the <b>hygric</b> buffer-ing of finishing materials than the original MBV. The <b>hygric</b> inertia of a building zone is then deduced from the adapted MBV of its differ-ent components. Numerical simulations for academic and realistic conditions demon-strate that there is a unique relationship between the room’s <b>hygric</b> inertia and the ob-served interior RH-amplitude. Finally, the paper shows that this specific <b>hygric</b> inertia of a room {{can be used as a}} valuable quantitative design tool, which can easily be im-plemented in building energy simulation models...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental and analytical {{study of the}} <b>hygric</b> behaviour of mortar joints, with specific attention to the influences of the curing conditions. Capillary water uptake in masonry is visualized with the X-ray projection method and approximated with the sharp-front-theory.

40|$|<b>Hygric</b> {{properties}} of building materials {{have been examined}} experimentally as well as numerically. However, the standard experimental procedures for <b>hygric</b> property determination typically lead to incomplete data and require several weeks of repetitive experiments. Moreover, measurement of the storage and transport properties at intermediate saturations is complex. On the other hand, existing numerical approaches can estimate moisture transport property. However, these models require prior measurement data like moisture storage and saturated permeability. This study proposes an alternative faster approach by using pore-scale physics to estimate complete data of moisture storage and transport properties. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Hydrated lime is a {{historic}} material currently used in conservation. It hardens slowly by carbonation slowing construction however, supplementary cementitious materials accelerate hardening enhancing strength. Hydrated-lime mortars with rice husk ash–RHA-; ground granulated blastfurnace slag–GGBS- and increasing amounts of two aggregates were studied. Increasing aggregate lowered strength as interfacial zones proliferate; it lowered <b>hygric</b> properties and raised water demand. Aggregate content/composition didn’t affect the high water retention. For the higher aggregate contents (90 days), limestone mortars are c. 20 % stronger than silica mortars while the (1 : 1) silica sand mortars are 56 % stronger in flexion. Additions increased strength with little impact on <b>hygric</b> properties. GGBS increased strength c. six times.

40|$|Abstract Five {{volcanic}} tuffs ranging from dacitic tuffs of Hungary to rhyolite, phonolite and basaltic tuffs of Ger-many were consolidated under laboratory conditions. Prior to consolidation an anti-hygro, a hydrous consolidant, which reduces the swelling ability of clay minerals, was applied. The three consolidants, a silicic acid ester (SAE), an elastic silicic acid ester (eSAE) and an acrylate resin (PMMA) were applied on test specimens under vacuum. Petrographic characterisation (polarizing microscopy, XRD, SEM) provided data for fabric analyses and the mineral {{composition of the}} tuffs. Changes in fabric, effective porosity, density, tensile strength, ultrasonic wave velocity were evaluated after the treatment. Weathering simulation tests such as <b>hygric</b> dilatation and thermal dilatation aimed to prove the effectiveness of consolidation and the durability of consolidated tuff samples. More than 500 samples were analysed. The tests showed that SAE caused the highest increase in indirect tensile strength. The water absorption and the pore size distribution of the tuffs were modified by consolidation. The PMMA reduced the water absorption the most, whereas SAE modified it the least. All the tested consolidants increased the thermal dilatation of the tuffs. The changes in <b>hygric</b> dilatation were not uniform: for most tuffs SAE increased and PMMA decreased the <b>hygric</b> dilatation, although the clay-rich Habichtswald tuff showed the opposite trend. The changes in <b>hygric</b> and thermal behaviour of consolidated tuff require special care when specific consolidants are chosen.

Three binders are considered: a formulated hydraulic lime based binder, a prompt cement based binder and a peculiar bio-polymer: the Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). The binder is coupled with hemp shiv to produce biocomposite. For each kind of binder, the specific manufacturing method is presented and discussed. The thermal properties of produced biocomposite are measured with a hot disk method at 23 °C, 50 %RH. The <b>hygric</b> characterization is based on the measurement of Moisture Buffer Value at 23 °C. The mechanical behavior of composite under compression is analyzed. Thermal conductivities range from 0. 08 to 0. 16 W/(m. K), this allows to use these composites without added insulation layer. Following the classification given in the Nordtest report, the studied materials are very good or excellent <b>hygric</b> regulator. Performances are slightly higher with mineral binders.

40|$|International audienceHemp {{concrete}} is a bio-based material generally made of lime-based binder and hemp shiv {{currently used}} for building envelop. This lightweight material shows a thermal conductivity about 100 mW/(m. K). On <b>hygric</b> point of view, hemp concrete is strongly hygroscopic, with high moisture transfer and storage capacities.

On mechanical point of view, hemp concrete is a non-load bearing material. It gains mechanical resistance over {{the first few weeks}} after manufacturing. These mechanical performances depend, among other factors, on the properties of components and on the mix proportioning. In order to improve the mechanical resistance of hemp concrete at early stage, this study investigates new formulations starting from reference formulation. The binder composition varies by increasing the substitution rate of lime-based binder for selected calcium sulfate-based binder. This binder leads to interesting hardening at early stage. The effect on mechanical performances at long term appears effective, without large influences on thermal and <b>hygric</b> properties (maximal variation about 20 % and 15 %).

40|$|Historic {{buildings}} often show a high thermal inertia, {{influencing the}} buildings thermal behavior. But not only thermal inertia, but also <b>hygric</b> inertia plays {{a significant role}} for the mean temperature and relative humidity and their fluctuations in those buildings. This paper presents measured values of temperature and humidity conditions in a historic massive stone church. The concept of moisture buffering is explained and discussed. To assess the influence of the <b>hygric</b> interaction of a building with its envelope in a simulation model, it is necessary to compute the coupled equations for energy and mass transfer in the building components. A hygrothermal whole building simulation software model of this church is presented and verified with the measured values to allow the assessment of the hygrothermal performance of this building. The verified model allows then to conclude on the effectiveness of different active and passive measures that might be implemented to ensure an indoor environment that fulfills preventive conservation requirements. Measurement results show a high influence of the <b>hygric</b> and thermal inertia on the indoor conditions.
