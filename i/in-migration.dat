25|$|In {{general the}} {{population}} of ethnic Russians in Ukraine increased due to assimilation and <b>in-migration</b> (colonization) between 1897 and 1939 despite the famine war and Revolution. Since 1991 it has decreased drastically in all regions, both quantitatively and proportionally. Ukraine in general lost 3 million Russians, or a little over one-quarter of all Russians living there in the 10-year period between 1991 and 2001, dropping from over 22% of {{the population of}} Ukraine to just over 17%. In the past 15 years since 2001, a further drop of Russian numbers has continued.|$|E
25|$|This {{change is}} due to the influx into Tallahassee of many {{students}} and workers {{from other parts of the}} state, and from outside the state and outside the South. Primarily this has been driven by the birth and great expansion of Florida State University, founded in 1947, to some extent to serve World War II veterans studying under the G.I. Bill. Its predecessor, Florida State College for Women, was politically liberal and pro-integration, but it was small and its faculty and graduates had little political power. Secondarily, Tallahassee's change has been due to Florida A University, and to the changing demographics of the state itself. Florida's population growth has been due to <b>in-migration</b> from other, usually more liberal parts of the country. As the state became more liberal, so did the legislators and their staffs.|$|E
25|$|Reviews of the 2000 census {{showed that}} African Americans have also left New York, but {{continued}} <b>in-migration</b> of young whites and immigrants has appeared {{to stabilize the}} white proportion of residents. Joseph J. Salvo, director of the New York Department of City Planning's population division, noted the diversity within the white population, as older European Americans are replaced by new immigrants, including the many Hispanics who identify as white. Similarly, black out-migration from Boston since 2000 resulted in the city's becoming majority white again by 2006. In 1970 {{at the peak of}} African-American expansion in Washington, DC, blacks comprised 70% of the capital's population. The percentage of black population has decreased significantly - to 55.6% in 2007, down nearly 8% since 2000, and much more since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at a {{high-resolution}} {{analysis of}} Y-chromosome J and E haplogroups among Andalusians to reconstruct Neolithic, protohistorical and historical migrations in the Mediterranean region. Genotyping of two samples from Granada (n= 250 males) and Huelva (n= 167 males) (Spain) with Y-chromosome binary and microsatellite markers was performed, {{and the results}} compared with other Mediterranean populations. The two samples showed genetic differences that {{can be associated with}} different evolutionary processes. Migrations toward Andalusia probably originated in the Arabian Peninsula, Fertile Crescent, Balkan region and North Africa, and they would have predominantly occurred in protohistoric and historic times. Maritime travel would have notably contributed to recent gene flow into Iberia. This survey highlight the complexity of the Mediterranean migration processes and demonstrate the impact of the different population sources on the genetic composition of the Spanish population. The main <b>in-migrations</b> to Iberia most likely did not occur through intermediate stages or, if such stages did occur, they would have been very few...|$|R
50|$|The Palo Alto Flood Basin was {{constructed}} in 1956 {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator-controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for mosquito control. Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however this is precisely when steelhead trout <b>in-migrations</b> should occur.|$|R
25|$|Edmonton {{had only}} sixteen Jews living in it in 1901, but the Jewish {{population}} grew rapidly {{as a result}} of immigration from Eastern Europe, and <b>in-migration</b> from small towns and Jewish agricultural colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 1906, Edmonton's Jews, in concert with Jews in Calgary, began recruiting in eastern Canada for a rabbi to organize their communities. Hyman Goldstick arrived from Toronto in August to take on the role. Born in Latvia in 1882, Goldstick was Edmonton's first rabbi, and also served as Calgary's rabbi. He was also the Edmonton community's mohel (circumciser), and ritual slaughterer (subsequent rabbis would, for decades, also fill all three roles). On September 16, 1906, the Edmonton Jewish community founded the Edmonton Hebrew Association. Its role was to provide for all Edmonton's Jewish needs, including Jewish education, circumcision, prayer services, kosher meat, and burial. High Holiday services were held in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows hall.|$|E

Also, unlike the initial pattern of migration several decades ago, this second Puerto Rican migration into New York and surrounding states is being driven by movement not only into New York City proper, but also into the city's surrounding suburban areas, such that the New York City Metropolitan Area gained the highest number of additional Puerto Rican Americans of any metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016, to 1,494,670 in 2016.|$|E
25|$|In the 1872 census, the Kammas made up 40 {{per cent}} of the {{agricultural}} population of the Krishna district (which included the present Guntur district until 1904). Along with Brahmins, they formed the domininant community of the district. By 1921, their population in the district increased to 47 per cent, representing a large <b>in-migration.</b> The literate Kammas learned the Vedas, wore the sacred threads, taught Sanskrit and performed priestly functions for the lower-caste members, which {{are said to have}} generated controversies. Despite this attachment to Brahminical orthodoxy, the Kammas related to the Kapus (cultivators) and their Shudra identity. The upward mobility of the community was noted in N. G. Ranga's study in the 1920s. The Kammas were also politically active, associating themselves with the Indian National Congress almost from its inception, and agitated for farmers' interests. They formed the Kamma Mahajana Sabha, a caste association, in 1910, which received encouragement from the political leaders. Ranga also started a Madras Kamma Association in 1919 and founded a journal Kamma Patrika, later renamed to Ryot Patrika. The Kammas constituted 6 per {{cent of the}} population in the Telugu-speaking of the Madras Presidency in 1921, a figure slightly higher than Brahmins, but lagging far behind 'Kapur or Reddi'.|$|E

40|$|America’s {{regard for}} ideas and education. The American Revolution began here. So did American literature, Transcendentalism, the anti-slavery movement, and the American Industrial Revolution. Public {{schooling}} and professional teacher training began here. Revolutionary ideas {{come from this}} part of the country. New England has re-created itself time and again—from a largely farming economy, to a highly industrialized one, to one driven by high technology. Today, in the midst of dramatic demographic shifts, the region is challenged to reinvent itself once again to capitalize on the strengths and ingenuities of its people. Despite our rich history, the educational prominence that has always distinguished New England is now at risk. This paper proposes that the region’s six land-grant universities play a leadership role in reinventing public education to prepare all of our citizens for a global economy. What’s Happening? Put bluntly, New England’s older, whiter population is both aging and moving away. Historically, the six New England states have balanced out-migrations of its citizens by <b>in-migrations</b> of newcomers. That will continue, but the people replacing the older, whiter, out-migrating population are likely to be younger immigrants from farther away, from Latin America and Southeast Asia rather than Europe, to be poorer, non-native speakers of English, and members of minorities. Nationally, the numbers of white workers are predicted to decline by 72 % over the next two decades, while numbers of minority workers are expected to rise by 20 %. Both nationally and regionally, by 2050 the population will be “majority minority, ” so to speak...|$|R
