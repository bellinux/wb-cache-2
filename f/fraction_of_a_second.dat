5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a small <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> The second {{problem was that the}} planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{it would take for}} a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E

5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E

50|$|False starts {{are common}} in racing sports (such as swimming, track, sprinting, and motor sports), where {{differences}} are made by <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> and where anxiety {{to get the best}} start plays a role in the athletes' behavior.|$|R
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking only a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed {{on a variety of}} invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
25|$|Time Penalties: In the past, {{a common}} timing rule was a 1/4 second penalty for each second or <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{over the time}} allowed. Since the early 2000s, this rule was changed by the FEI so that each second or <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> over the time allowed would result in 1 time penalty (e.g. with a time allowed of 72 seconds, a time of 73.09 seconds would result in 2 time faults).|$|E

25|$|There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The {{latter are}} easier to build, since the high {{intensity}} lasts only for a tiny <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> which damages the nonlinear optical material and the mirrors less than a continuous high intensity.|$|E
25|$|Trace {{storage is}} an extra feature {{available}} on some analog scopes; they used direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows the trace pattern that normally decays in a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{to remain on}} the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid/electric assist {{vehicles}} experience {{almost no}} delay in power from a stop, {{due to the}} instant availability of power from the traction battery to the electric motor(s).

25|$|Lightning {{scattering}} {{has sometimes}} been observed on VHF and UHF over distances of about 500km. The hot lightning channel scatters radio-waves for a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> The RF noise burst from the lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure. Although the hot lightning channel is briefly observable with microwave radar, no practical use for this mode {{has been found in}} communications.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead {{the majority of the}} RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{problem has}} also been {{considered}} {{in relation to the}} idea of mass accretion in connection with the Expanding Earth theory. Among the early theorists to link mass increase in some sort of push gravity model to Earth expansion were Yarkovsky and Hilgenberg. The idea of mass accretion and the expanding earth theory are not currently considered to be viable by mainstream scientists. This is because, among other reasons, according to the principle of mass-energy equivalence, if the Earth was absorbing the energy of the ultramundane flux at the rate necessary to produce the observed force of gravity (i.e. by using the values calculated by Poincaré), its mass would be doubling in each <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the most}} basic level, {{echolocation}} {{is based on the}} neural anatomy of auditory brain circuitry.

5000|$|It is {{not clear}} when the term {{actually}} originated. The first industrial produced leaf shutters from Voigtländer in Germany in 1890 had two settings: [...] "M" [...] for Moment exposure and [...] "Z" [...] for Zeit (time) exposure.

25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only 10 °C can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells. If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> literally faster than {{the blink of an}} eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E
25|$|The flow of {{reactants}} {{into the}} reaction chamber and subsequent ejection {{occur in a}} series of about 70 pulses, {{at a rate of about}} 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel {{to the left of}} the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions, but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the drive-wheel), representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> earlier, as if to show motion through absence. With this type of game playing with contradictory visual codes (positive and negative space), Metzinger discerns the past and the present infinitesimally separated in time; while the perception of the future is left to the intellectual discretion of the observer to contemplate.|$|E
50|$|Response time: If {{the process}} {{requires}} {{a very fast}} response to temperature changes (<b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> as opposed to <b>seconds),</b> then <b>a</b> thermocouple is the best choice.
