5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{expedition}} was a French naval operation {{launched in}} 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation {{was intended as}} both a commerce raiding operation against the British trading posts of West Africa and as a diversion to the Trafalgar campaign. Sailing from Lorient in October 1805 with one ship of the line, two frigates and a corvette, Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite was under orders to intercept and destroy British traders and slave ships off the West African coast and await reinforcements under Jérôme Bonaparte which were {{to be used in}} the invasion and capture of one of the British trading forts for use as a permanent French naval base from which further raiding operations could be conducted. It was also hoped by the French naval command that L'Hermite might <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> of the large British fleet maintained off Cadiz away from the blockade to allow the French and Spanish allied fleet trapped in the harbour to escape.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random <b>draw.</b> <b>Some</b> 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{they were}} sent to Pernois for rest and re-organisation, and after being brought back up to about two-thirds strength, the 2nd Battalion's next {{involvement}} in the fighting came around Mouquet Farm when they were briefly put into the line on 18/19 August to provide reinforcement, before being quickly relieved a few days later. In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the Ypres–Commines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division {{were placed in the}} centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> attention away from the fighting that was occurring on the Somme.|$|E

25|$|In 1843, Gosse gave up {{the school}} to write An Introduction to Zoology for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> of the illustrations.

25|$|The Basel museums {{encompass}} {{a series}} of museums {{in the city of}} Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> one and a half million visitors annually.|$|E

25|$|In the 1840s the {{recently}} formed abolitionist Liberty Party attempted to attract Virginians to their cause and did <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> members from western Virginia. The advocacy of abolitionism however also brought about violent reactions from pro-slavery Virginians. From 1840 through the 1850s {{most of the}} notable mob actions against abolitionists in Virginia took place in western Virginia. In 1839 a mob from Guyandotte crossed the Ohio River and kidnapped a man in order to tar and feather him. In 1854 West Virginians again crossed the river to Quaker Bottom (now Proctorville) to beat abolitionists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Draw</b> <b>some</b> conclusions: for example, the SGXB SAX J1818.6-1703 was {{discovered}} by BeppoSAX in 1998, identified as a SGXB of spectral type between O9I−B1I, which also displayed short and bright flares and an unusually very low quiescent level leading to its classification as a SFXT. The analysis indicated an unusually long orbital period: 30.0 ± 0.2 d and an elapsed accretion phase of ~6 d implying an elliptical orbit and possible supergiant spectral type between B0.5-1I with eccentricities e ~ 0.3–0.4. The large variations in the X-ray flux can be explained through accretion of macro-clumps formed within the stellar wind.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{architecture}} {{encompasses a}} wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day. Whilst it does have unique characteristics like its geometric and interlace patterned ornaments, it does <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> influence from Persian, Roman, Byzantine Chinese as Indian architectures as Islam was present from the Near East & North Africa to East Asia. The principal Islamic architectural types are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to monitor the evolution of Koine Greek and its splitting into the modern Greek dialects; certain researchers make {{the hypothesis that the}} various local varieties were formed between the 10th and the 12th century (as part of an evolution starting a few centuries before), but it {{is difficult}} to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> safer conclusions because of the absence of texts written in the vernacular language, when this initial dialect differentiation occurred. Very few paradigms of these local varieties are found in certain texts, which however used mainly learned registers. The first texts written in modern Greek dialects appear during the Early Renaissance in the islands of Cyprus and Crete.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and honestly believe at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E
500|$|After a {{prolonged}} period in a foreign province a regiment would become assimilated, since {{the majority of its}} new recruits would be drawn from the province in which it was stationed, or neighbouring provinces. Those same [...] "British" [...] units, mostly based on the Danube frontier, would by c. 150, after almost a century away from their home island, be largely composed of Illyrian, Thracian and Dacian recruits. However, there is evidence that a few regiments at least continued to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> recruits from their original home provinces in the 2nd century e.g. Batavi units stationed in Britain.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> conclusions about Themistocles's character. Perhaps his most evident trait was his massive ambition; [...] "In his ambition he surpassed all men"; [...] "he hankered after public office rather as a man in delirium might crave a cure". He was proud and vain, and anxious for recognition of his deeds. His relationship with power was of a particularly personal nature; while he undoubtedly desired the best for Athens, many of his actions also {{seem to have been}} made in self-interest. He also appears to have been corrupt (at least by modern standards), and was known for his fondness of bribes.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{made her}} only {{appearance}} at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, [...] "I'm very happy I didn't hear anyone call out 'It's about time'." [...] The following year, she was paired with John Wayne in the western Rooster Cogburn, a sequel to his Oscar-winning film True Grit. Echoing her African Queen character, Hepburn again played a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member's death. The movie received mediocre reviews. Its casting was enough to <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> people to the box office, {{but it did not}} meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful.|$|E
500|$|Regardless, Lee {{received}} Goodman's {{approval for}} the name Spider-Man and the [...] "ordinary teen" [...] concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby [...] "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and <b>draw</b> <b>some</b> pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, [...] "I hated {{the way he was}} doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled: ...|$|E
