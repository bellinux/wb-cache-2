25|$|Another {{variation}} of the regression hypothesis is the best learned-last-forgotten hypothesis, which emphasizes the intensity {{and quality of the}} acquired knowledge, not the order in which it is learned. Therefore, the better something is learned, the longer it will remain. Because the language component is repeated again and again, it becomes automated and increases the probability that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> in the memory (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 241).|$|E
500|$|On the CBS sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper {{is a fan}} of Firefly. When he and Leonard Hofstadter are {{discussing}} their roommate agreement, they include a passage in which they dedicate Friday nights to watching Firefly, as Sheldon believes <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> for years. [...] Upon its cancellation, he brands Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox, a traitor. During the second season of The Big Bang Theory, in episode 17 ("The Terminator Decoupling"), Summer Glau appears as herself, encountering Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends on a train to San Francisco. When Raj tries to hit on her he says that although he is an astrophysicist, she was actually in space during the shooting of Firefly. Glau chides him for believing this and Raj backtracks, saying, [...] "Those are crazy people!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Sunderland’s {{relations}} with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the twain, were tenuous and strained. When Louis failed to give James any assistance against the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Sunderland told Barillon sharply [...] "the King your master may have plans I cannot discern, but I hope he will put things right {{by making it}} clear that this has all been a misunderstanding". When Barillon protested that his master's aim was [...] "the Peace of Europe" [...] Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: [...] "myself I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> until {{one side or the other}} has a good reason for breaking it". To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden the Court. [...] Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was “but just that it come home to him".|$|E
2500|$|The separatists {{deny that}} the war is over, and guerrilla warfare {{continues}} throughout the North Caucasus. Colonel Sulim Yamadayev, Chechnya's second most powerful loyalist warlord after Kadyrov, also denied {{that the war is}} over. In March 2007, Yamadayev claimed there were well over 1,000 separatists and foreign Islamic militants entrenched in the mountains of Chechnya alone: [...] "The war is not over, the war is far from being over. What we are facing now is basically a classic partisan war and my prognosis is that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> two, three, maybe even five more years." [...] According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating [...] "while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues." [...] The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists.|$|E
