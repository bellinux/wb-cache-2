40|$|A {{series of}} melt blown samples were {{produced}} from three hardness grades of ether based thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPU). The fabrics were tested to investigate their structure-property relationship in a melt blown process. Solution viscosities {{of the web}} were only 20 - 26 % of there original values indicating a large loss in polymer molecular weight during melt blowing. Fiber diameter distributions measured on melt blown samples were found comparable to those made with more conventional polymers. The fiber orientation distribution functions (ODF) suggest slight fiber orientation in machine direction. Tensile and elongation properties depended on die-to-collector distance (DCD), polymer hardness and fiber ODF. A strong relationship between the tensile strength and die-to-collector distance was identified and attributed to reduced interfiber adhesion in the web with increasing DCD. The reduction in adhesion was attributed to greater extents of solidification before reaching the <b>forming</b> <b>belt</b> for longer DCDs. This paper {{is the first in}} a series relating the influence of the melt blowing process parameters on the polymer properties and the nonwoven fabric properties for block thermoplastic elastomers...|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster.

50|$|Partial melting has {{resulted}} in migmatites. These <b>form</b> <b>belts</b> named after Saint-Malo, Dinan, and St Cast in north east Brittany. The Rance valley has a metamorphic sequence ranging from phyllites, amphibolite, metatexites, diatexites which have melted into granite. Leucogranites and anatectic granites have been derived from sediments melting. East Brittany and Lower Normandy contains the Mancellian batholith which consists of intrusions of granodiorite and granite. These other plutons are derived from fractionally crystallized mantle melts.|$|R

50|$|A form (poome sae) is {{a series}} of kicks, blocks and other {{techniques}} put together in a set pattern. The pattern becomes more complex as students progress through the ranks. For example, the 9th grade white <b>belt</b> <b>form</b> contains eighteen moves. The 5th grade green <b>belt</b> <b>form</b> has 34 moves, the 1st degree black <b>belt</b> <b>form</b> has 81 moves, and the 9th degree black <b>belt</b> <b>form</b> has 99 moves. If all of the forms (eighteen in all) are done in sequence, they form the pattern of a nine pointed star (eight outer points plus a center point) referred to as the Songahm Star. According to the ATA, when the outer points of the Songahm star are connected, they form a circle which exemplifies complete balance. The ATA teaches that forms create a contextual application for new material learned at each belt level.|$|R
3000|$|Secondary pore {{development}} zones can {{be defined}} in three ways: (1) the percent of secondary pores is greater than 50  %; (2) the porosity of the reservoirs {{is higher than the}} effective reservoir porosity cutoff because the absolute content of secondary pores is high; and (3) high porosity reservoirs concentrate to <b>form</b> <b>belts</b> at particular depth intervals in the porosity-depth profile, with the porosity envelope curve bulging toward higher porosities.
