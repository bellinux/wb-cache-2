Mahendran said, [...] "If anybody tries to remake this black-and-white film, {{they will make}} a mockery of it." [...] According to Balachander, [...] "Just like Sivaji today, people talked about Chandralekha in the past. Produced {{at a cost of}} 30 lakhs ( [...] , a huge sum at that time), it has grand sets. I have seen it 12 times." [...] In December 2008, Muthiah said: [...] "Given how spectacular it wasand the appreciation lavished on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with itI'm sure that if re-released, it would do better at the box office than most Tamil films today." [...] In a 2011 interview with Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), South Indian Bollywood actor Vyjayanthimala said that although people consider that she [...] "paved the way" [...] for other South Indian female actors in Hindi cinema, [...] "the person who really opened the doors was S. S. Vasan ... When [...] released, it took the North by storm because by then they haven't seen that kind of lavish sets, costumes and splendour. So Vasan was the person who opened the door for Hindi films in the South." ...|$|E

[...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} writers view The Last Good Kiss as Crumley's best work.

60|$|I fell asleep; {{and when}} I awoke no lute was sounding.
