5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy.

I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
