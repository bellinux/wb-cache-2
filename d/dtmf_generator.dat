50|$|Modern phones with an {{integrated}} circuit based <b>DTMF</b> <b>generator</b> can frequently be modified by simply soldering a wire from the 1633 Hz leg to a switch that toggles between that leg and the 1477 Hz leg for the rightmost column of keys.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Induction motors are {{the most}} {{extensively}} used motors in most power-driven home appliances, agricultural and industrial applications. Simple and rugged design, low cost, low maintenance and direct connection to an AC power source are the chief advantages of an AC induction motor. Many applications need variable speed operation {{and one of them}} is a simple fan load. The <b>DTMF</b> <b>generator</b> which generates the analogue output signal for the corresponding button pressed using key pad. This analogue output is fed to the FM Transmitter and sent through the antenna. At the other end, the FM Receiver picks up the signal and feeds it to the signal decoder, there the decoding takes place and this decoding data is given to the PIC Micro controller. The software in the PIC receives the signal and accordingly drives the SCR Circuit, which in turn is connected to load serially. Simulation of DTMF is carried out using SIMULINK and in the experimental work a prototype model is built through the PIC microcontroller (PIC 16 F 873) which is used to generate the PWM pulses for speed control of the motor. The main aim of the this paper is to design an real time electronic control system that can be used to control the speed of motors kept at remote locations using an embedded technology...|$|E
40|$|This {{application}} note describes {{the implementation of}} a dual tone multiple frequency (<b>DTMF)</b> tone <b>generator</b> and detector for the TMS 320 C 54 x. This {{application note}} provides some theoretical background on the algorithms used for tone generation and detection. It documents the actual implementation in detail. Finally the code is benchmarked in terms o...|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio (or ham) {{operators}} within {{radio range}} of a local node are able to use <b>DTMF</b> tone <b>generators</b> to initiate a node-to-node connection with any other available node in the world. Each node has a unique 4 digit node number {{in the range of}} 1000-8999. A real-time searchable list of all nodes worldwide (including their current status) is available anytime by viewing the IRLP Network at a Glance. As of June 2009, there are over 3,180 nodes across 7 continents.|$|R
50|$|When Touch-Tone {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (<b>DTMF)</b> tone <b>generator</b> also required correct polarity as it depended on the line D.C. voltage for operation. Later Touch-Tone telephones included a diode bridge that eliminated the polarity sensitivity, so that consumer telephone service is essentially immune to reversal today. However, some special circuits, such as some direct inward dialing (DID) trunks, T-1 lines, and ground start lines connected to field side (terminal) equipment, e.g., a corporate private branch exchange (PBX) switch, correctly operate only with proper tip and ring polarity.|$|R
