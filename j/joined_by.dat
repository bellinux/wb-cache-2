According to the present status of <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming of magnesium alloy, the relative proposing solutions by using the contradiction matrix of TRIZ are given. The practice shows that dieless clinching solution is effective, and then the improvement program which also can decrease the pre-heating time considerably is presented.

40|$|<b>Joining</b> <b>by</b> forming of {{magnesium}} alloys is restricted by the limited forming capability {{of magnesium}} at room temperature. To form acceptable joints without cracks usually heating {{of the parts}} to temperatures of 220 °C or more is required. The application of state-of-the-art <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming methods (such as self-pierce-riveting or clinching with a contoured die) implicates pre-heating times of at least 3 - 6 s to achieve joints of acceptable quality. A new <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming technology, that is working with a flat anvil as a counter tool instead of the contoured die shall be introduced in this paper. This new technology is offering important advantages especially in joining Mg/Mg, Al/Mg or Fe/Mg connections, most remarkably being the reduction of pre-heating times to less than 1 s, thus allowing for the fast and reliable joining of magnesium parts. Parameter influences on {{the formation of the}} connections have been investigated and the values for the tensile strength have been determined {{for a wide range of}} connections...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming {{technology}} for integrating piezoceramic fibers as functional elements into microstructured aluminum sheets proved its feasibility in experimental investigations. Thereby five piezoceramic fibers with geometrical dimensions of 12 mm x 0. 56 mm x 0. 46 mm are placed into cavities with dimensions of 10 mm x 0. 6 mm x 0. 6 mm. The joining is performed through narrowing of the cavities by applying a vertical force {{of up to}} 20 kN to the 400 µm wide webs between the cavities of the microstructure. For later smart sensor or actuator applications the mechanical interconnection and preload between the fibers and the surrounding metal structure is an important key issue. Preliminary investigations characterize the mechanical interconnection of the joining partners after the joining operation with microscopic methods. Scope of {{the paper is the}} development of a novel method for monitoring the condition of piezoceramic fibers during the <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming process. The paper presents the latest scientific results on the electro-mechanical behavior of piezoelectric ceramics during <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming. Numerical results of the stress distribution and resonance characteristics of the piezoceramic-metal-composites are presented. Furthermore fabricated test samples are characterized by impedance spectroscopy. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a novel monitoring method for the piezoceramic fibers during the <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> forming process is proposed. For this purpose, the piezoceramic fibers are electrically contacted inside the forming...|$|R
