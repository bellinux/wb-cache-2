5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into <b>hexapeptide</b> fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E

By taking hexapeptides (six amino acid-long fragments) of a protein of interest and selecting the lowest energy match to a structure similar to that of a known fibril forming <b>hexapeptide,</b> RosettaDesign was able to identify peptides twice as likely to form fibrils as are random proteins. Rosetta@home was used in the same study to predict structures for amyloid beta, a fibril-forming protein that has been postulated to cause Alzheimer's disease.

Our long-term goal is to produce a lexicon of oligopeptides, classifying them into at least five categories: (i) ubiquitous, (ii) function specific, (iii) group specific, (iv) species specific, and (v) nonexistent. To begin with, {{we report on the}} varying frequencies of individual oligopeptides (dipeptidic to hexapeptidic in length) found among 2862 human proteins, 1942 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, and 2672 Escherichia coli proteins registered in the Swiss-Prot data base (version 29. 0, released in June 1994). At all lengths (dipeptides to <b>hexapeptides),</b> homooligopeptides were very prominent among the most frequently occurring varieties in proteins of human and bakers' yeast origins. However, {{this was not the case}} with E. coli. While all of the expected 20 (3) varieties of tripeptides were found among human proteins, three tripeptides (Cys-Cys-Trp, Trp-Trp-Cys, and Trp-Trp-His) were missing from the bakers' yeast proteins. Three tripeptides (Cys-Ile-Trp, Cys-Met-Tyr, and Cys-Trp-Trp) were also absent from E. coli proteins. Inasmuch as the Swiss-Prot data base already contained 67 % of the expected total of 4000 E. coli proteins, it is virtually certain that 96, 000 varieties of <b>hexapeptides</b> containing at least one or another of the three missing tripeptides noted above shall be nonexistent in E. coli.

The worldwide increase in resistance to conventional antibiotics requires {{the search for}} alternatives not only for animal artificial insemination industries, but also for veterinary and human medicine. Cationic antimicrobial peptides are of interest as a novel class of antimicrobial additives for boar semen preservation. The present study investigated effects of two synthetic cyclic <b>hexapeptides</b> (c-WFW, c-WWW) and a synthetic helical magainin II amide derivative (MK 5 E) on boar sperm during semen storage at 16 °C for 4 days. The standard extender, Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) containing 250 µg/mL gentamicin (standard), was compared to combinations of BTS {{with each of the}} peptides in a split-sample procedure. Examination revealed peptide- and concentration-dependent effects on sperm integrity and motility. Negative effects were more pronounced for MK 5 E than in hexapeptide-supplemented samples. The cyclic <b>hexapeptides</b> were partly able to stimulate a linear progressive sperm movement. When using low concentrations of cyclic <b>hexapeptides</b> (4 µM c-WFW, 2 µM c-WWW) sperm quality was comparable to the standard extender over the course of preservation.

In order to investigate the interaction of peptides with the membrane, electron spin resonance spectroscopic measurements were performed using spin-labeled lipids. C-WWW and c-WFW reversibly immobilized an analog of phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas MK 5 E caused an irreversible increase of PC mobility.

40|$|AbstractVarious {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for {{the sequence of events}} occurring after binding of specific antimicrobial peptides to lipid membranes. The lipid clustering model arose by the finding that antimicrobial peptides can induce a segregation of certain negatively charged lipids in lipid model membranes. Anionic lipid segregation by cationic peptides is initially an effect of charge interaction where the ratio of peptide and lipid charges is thought to be the decisive parameter in the peptide induced lipid demixing. However, the sequence of events following this initial lipid clustering is more complex and can lead to deactivation of membrane proteins involved in cell division or perturbation of lipid reorganization essential for cell division. In this study we used DSC and ITC techniques to investigate the effect of binding different cyclic <b>hexapeptides</b> with varying antimicrobial efficacy, to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) /phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid membranes and their ability to induce lipid segregation in these mixtures. We found that these cyclic <b>hexapeptides</b> consisting of three charged and three aromatic amino acids showed indeed different abilities to induce lipid demixing depending on their amino acid composition and their sequence. The results clearly showed that the cationic amino acids are essential for electrostatic binding but that the three hydrophobic amino acids in the peptides and their position in the sequence also contribute to binding affinity and to the extent of induction of lipid clustering. The efficacy of these different <b>hexapeptides</b> to induce PG clusters in PG/PE membranes was found to be correlated with their antimicrobial activity...|$|R
