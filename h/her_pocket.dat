5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the head with it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, saw this extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer.

5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in <b>her</b> <b>pocket,</b> and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E

The woman, after hearing that Katja is dead, instructs Sarah to dispose of the body and retrieve Katja's briefcase. While burying Katja's body, Sarah finds a hotel key in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> and keeps it. She visits her foster brother Felix's apartment and discovers that the $75,000 she stole from Beth's bank account has been taken by Beth's detective partner Art. When she returns to Beth's apartment she is surprised to find Beth's boyfriend, Paul, who seems confused by Sarah's demeanour but does not realise that she is not Beth. The next day, Sarah prepares to meet Art, and lies that the $75,000 belongs to Paul, but Art says he will return the money only after the hearing Beth must attend about a suspicious shooting in which she was involved.|$|E
5|$|Aguilera {{then takes}} a touch screen Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone from <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> {{with an image}} of a futuristic blue haired character, after {{producing}} a scene of a convertible car, she inputs the character from the phone onto the screen and into the car and the blue haired character is then shown driving. Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) {{continues}} to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), {{who is still}} trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b> She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

25|$|Kim meets Silas {{once again}} in the {{hospital}} while it is temporarily shut down. Silas and Lindsey put their plan into action and break into the Roscoe home but Mercedes is not there. Angered by this failure, Silas disowns Lindsey and tells her he will go after Mercedes alone. However, Lindsey's waters break and she goes into labour. Alarmed, Silas bundles her into the Roscoe garage, steals Joe's phone and abandons her. Later that day, Mercedes answers the door to find Silas. Meanwhile, Lindsey has managed to summon Kim for help and gives birth to a baby girl at the hospital with the reluctant help of Tegan and Celine McQueen (Sarah George). When Joe and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) arrive at the hospital to find Lindsey with the baby, they try to call the police, but Lindsey warns them not to as Mercedes is in danger. Silas plays a game of chess with Mercedes, while blaming her for Riley's death. Mercedes angrily demands where Silas was when Riley died and throws him into a rage when she reminds him of his part in Heidi's death. He tells her that she is to be his final victim and he will not be cheated this time as he was with Lynsey and Texas. Silas allows Mercedes to take JJ to bed, but she secretly hides a nail file in <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b> When Silas guides her downstairs, Mercedes attempts to stab him with the nail file, but Silas easily deflects it. Lindsey then gives the order for Silas to kill Mercedes, but Mercedes criticises him for taking orders from a woman, especially one who cheated on Joe with Freddie. When Silas criticises Mercedes' stillborn son, Gabriel, Mercedes asks him to kill her so she can be with him. Silas is touched by this and noting that Mercedes has made significant effort to mend her ways over the years, he decides to spare her life. When Lindsey shows up at the Roscoe home, having managed to escape from the hospital with her baby, Silas feigns concern and asks to hold her baby. Silas then gives Mercedes the baby and asks her to ensure that the child grows up as pure and innocent as she is now. Silas then turns on Lindsey for cheating on the Roscoe brothers. Joe, Kim and Freddie arrive to find Lindsey's corpse on the couch. Silas is last seen looking on as a hysterical Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is led out of The Loft by Tegan and Celine. He then leaves the village, smirking.|$|E

60|$|On {{the present}} occasion, {{it was the}} old story over again. My sisters had done their best to stop it, and had failed. I {{had no choice but}} to appear on the scene--to begin, perhaps, by boxing her ears: to end, certainly, by filling <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought.

Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|R
500|$|Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle [...] {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as early as 1886, {{it was not until}} 1901 Potter began elaborating it while on holiday at Lingholm west of Derwentwater where she met young Kathleen and Lucie Carr, daughters of the local vicar. In 1902, it was put to paper. The Carr family lived at Skelghyl, but Potter took some artistic liberty and moved the house's location to Little Town in the text. The family came to tea at Lingholm often with Potter delighted by the one-year-child's behaviour. On one occasion, Lucie left her gloves behind at Lingholm, and Potter transformed the incident into the fictional Lucie's propensity for losing <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> handkerchiefs. A small copy book contains what {{is believed to be the}} earliest manuscript of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Its title page is inscribed: [...] "Made at Lingholm, Sept. 01 told to cousin Stephanie at Melford Nov. 01—written down Nov. 02. There are no pictures, it is a good one to tell—" ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{created a}} new storyline in October 2015 when Les Coker (Roger Sloman) was {{revealed}} to the audience as a crossdresser, going {{by the name of}} Christine. Les's wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), struggles with this and ends their marriage. In one of several attempts to win Pam back, Les burns all of Christine's belongings. Babe witnesses this and steals a half-burnt photograph of Christine. Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips them into <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as simple as that really." [...] She also said that she [...] "resents seeing [...] and Pam together as a unit" [...] after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has [...] "never had what they have".|$|E
500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a generic {{description}} for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a [...] "pocket" [...] or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting <b>her</b> <b>Pocket</b> Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: [...] Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} at his destination, the kidnapper, Michael Foster (Michael Eklund), removes Casey {{from the trunk}} and finds the phone in <b>her</b> <b>pocket,</b> with 9-1-1 listening on the line. Through the phone, Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to turn himself in and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, [...] "It's already done" [...] and Jordan realizes that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah six months prior. Meanwhile, Phillips, accompanied by Officer Jake Devans (David Otunga) and others in law enforcement, raid Michael's home, but find only his wife and children. Finding a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, they realize that Casey resembles the latter. Additionally, the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael's wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody there and leave. Michael begins to wash and cut Casey's hair. Determined to rescue Casey, Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his leukemia-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor flagpole, reminiscent of sounds heard in the background in the final moments of the 9-1-1 call. She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood. After she accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar, she climbs down in without calling the police.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> as she lies back down next to him.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Trimmer {{was born}} on 6 January 1741 in Ipswich, England to Joshua Kirby and Sarah (née Bell); {{her father was a}} noted artist and served as President of the Society of Artists of Great Britain. Trimmer had one younger brother, William; she was {{apparently}} the better writer, for she would sometimes compose his school essays for him. As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justiner’s boarding school in Ipswich, an experience she always remembered fondly. In 1755, the family moved to London when her father, who had written several important works on perspective, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales. Because of her father's connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to meet the painters William Hogarth and Thomas Gainsborough as well as the by-then legendary writer and critic Samuel Johnson. She made a favourable impression on Johnson when she immediately produced <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> copy of John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) to help settle a dispute between her father and Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton enough to carry his works with her at all times, [...] "subsequently invited her to his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical The Rambler". In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil the Prince of Wales (soon to be George III), her father was made Clerk of the Works to the Royal Household at Kew Palace and the family moved to Kew. There she met James Trimmer, whom she married on 21 September 1762; after their marriage, the couple moved to Old Brentford.|$|E

500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
