25|$|Tax advantages. The {{market for}} {{convertibles}} is primarily pitched towards the non taxpaying investor. The price will substantially reflect (1) {{the value of}} the underlying shares, (2) the <b>discounted</b> <b>gross</b> income advantage of the convertible over the underlying shares, plus (3) some figure for the embedded optionality of the bond. The tax advantage is greatest with mandatory convertibles. Effectively a high tax-paying shareholder can benefit from the company securitising gross future income on the convertible, income which it can offset against taxable profits.|$|R

We find that subjects search less in both treatments with discount frames irrespective where the discount is offered. We argue that this bias results from subjects basing their decisions on salient characteristics of the situation rather than on objective price distributions...|$|R

40|$|Not only {{transition}} countries {{but also}} {{a large number of}} developing (and developed) countries have established free economic zones (FEZs) with the aim of attracting foreign capital by providing tax incentives, creating employment opportunities and promoting exports as well as regional development. Major theoretical justifications for the establishment of such economic zones generally maintain that there are economies of scale in the development of land and in the provision of common services and utilities as well as external economies of agglomeration by having similar industries grouped together. One of the main characteristics of FEZs is the provision of generous tax investment promotion schemes solely allowed in this enclave. In general such measures include: (a) profit tax exemption, (b) free or accelerated depreciation, (c) investment tax allowance, (d) subsidy for investment costs, etc. The incentive e. ects of various tax concessions on firms' investment decisions can be compared {{on the basis of the}} net present value model. Without taxation, the net present value (NPV) is equal to the present value of future <b>gross</b> return, <b>discounted</b> at an appropriate interest rate less investment cost. An investment project is therefore considered to be profitable when the NPV is positive. After introducing the corporate income tax, the present value of the asset generated from an investment amounts to the sum of the present value of net return (gross return less taxes) and the tax savings, led by, for example, an incentive depreciation provision. In this study the theoretical approach is accompanied by a model simulation based on selected parameters...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{population}} health status {{are known to}} influence government fiscal transfers {{both in terms of}} lost tax revenue and increased expenditure for health and social services. To estimate the fiscal impact of changes in morbidity and mortality attributed to rotavirus immunisation, we developed a government perspective model to estimate discounted net tax revenue for Ghana and Vietnam. The model derived the impact of rotavirus morbidity and mortality on lifetime productive capacity and related tax transfers, and demand for government transfers in relation to education and healthcare in immunised and non-immunised cohorts. The discounted age-specific net tax revenue was derived by deducting transfers from <b>gross</b> taxes and <b>discounting</b> for time preference. In Ghana, taking into account immunisation costs, tax and transfers, the estimated net discounted tax for the immunised cohort was estimated to generate $ 2. 6 billion in net taxes up to age 65. In Vietnam, the net revenue attributed to the immunised cohort reached $ 55. 17 billion suggesting an incremental benefit of approximately $ 29 million. We posit that the government perspective fiscal framework described here is a valid approach for estimating how governments benefit from investments in immunisation that can be considered supplementary to conventional cost-effectiveness approaches for defining value.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Questions {{relating}} to economic performance, biological conservation and variation in resource abundance and harvest of ocean shrimp {{have led to}} increasing pressure for management action. Developing effective management policies for this highly variable resource requires a comprehensive understanding of the fishery and marine processes. Important factors in understanding the fishery include oceanographic influences on shrimp distribution, abundance, and fishery and market dynamics. Fishery regulations for Oregon ocean shrimp, Pandalus jordani, are designed to protect age one shrimp from overharvest and sustain long-term fishery benefits. The research presented in this dissertation describes the development and analysis of analytical models ranging from classical, biological based yield-per-recruit management approaches to optimization models that incorporate economic variables and environmental recruitment relationships. This research is composed of three separate but complimentary papers regarding management of the ocean shrimp fishery. In the first paper, a yield-per-recruit analysis found that high natural mortality rates lead to yield maximization by selecting relatively young shrimp. The revenue-per-recruit analysis found that by delaying the season opening date, shrimp revenue would generate higher total revenues, while decreasing total fishing mortality and harvest. The second paper utilized a nonlinear optimization model with cost and market information to compare harvest strategies on fishery yield, <b>gross</b> revenue and <b>discounted</b> net present value (NPV). A key extension modeled a vertically integrated fishery from harvest through processing and compared harvest strategies based on wholesale prices, shrimp quality and processing yields. The optimization model that generated high yields exhibited high levels of effort and landings but low profits and NPV. The revenue policy maximization resulted in allocation of seasonal effort that produced high value older shrimp. NPV maximization generated high value shrimp landings with lower seasonal effort. Variability in shrimp recruitment and the impact on fishery utilization, income and efficiency was analyzed in the third paper. The optimization model that incorporated a stock recruit relationship and effects of environmental variables indicated an optimal harvest strategy that protects the spawning stock within a season and closes the fishery in years of poor recruitment. The results of this research highlight the complexity of management decisions when environmental forces and economic factors are jointly considered...|$|R
