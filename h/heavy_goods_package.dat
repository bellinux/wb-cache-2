40|$|The SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research investigated: (a) the {{problems}} occurring on Dutch municipal roads that involve <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles; and (b) what measures {{can be taken}} to correct these problems. A survey was conducted among 24 municipalities to accomplish this study. According to the Regional Committees for Road Safety, twelve of these municipalities experienced (or are experiencing) problems with <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The remaining twelve municipalities were selected from the Statistics Netherlands' file of Dutch municipalities by means of a stratified sample. `Obvious' problems mentioned by the municipalities were: (1) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles within, and travelling through, the town centre; (2) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles on major roads inside built-up areas; and (3) inconveniences caused by these vehicles. It is described which measures have already been taken and which ones are being prepared. Only two measures were mentioned by {{more than half of the}} municipalities: (i) concentrating business within industrial sites; and (ii) instituting entry prohibitions for lorries. It is concluded that definitely more attention should be given to measures concerning <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The approach to problems involving these vehicles was based on the principles of the `sustainably safe' concept. Measures recommended for solving these problems were: realising major roads, and creating areas with low vehicle concentrations. (A...|$|R

30|$|Fatalities by {{traffic unit}} are {{presented}} above in Table 3. When a <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle {{is involved in}} a fatal accident, more than 90 % of killed people are in opposite traffic units. For light goods vehicles this share is around 60 % and for cars around 20 %. These results suggest that fatalities in counterpart units should also be considered when analysing the meaning of cars and especially <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles for road safety.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} driver’s {{car following}} headway on multilane highways. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse the driver’s car following headway along multilane highway at four selected locations. The objectives of this study were to determine car headway at Jalan Batu Pahat – Ayer Hitam multilane highway and to develop linear regression models to present the relationships between headway and speed. Videotaping method was used in field data collection during peak hours. Data were extracted from recorded video by using the image processing technique software. The distance headways and associated vehicles speeds were classified into vehicle following category by vehicle type: car following car, car following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle, <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle following car categories. Linear regressions models were used to develop the relationships between headway and speed. Based on all headway distribution, it is found that patterns of the vehicle headways at four study locations were similar, which shown a significant number of the vehicles travel at headways less than 5 seconds. Furthermore, it can be concluded that many drivers tend to follow the vehicles ahead closely on multilane highways. The regression models were significantly reliable based on their R-square values which are ranging between 0. 80 and 0. 95. From the analysis, cars were found to maintain larger headways when following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles compare to when following other cars...|$|R
