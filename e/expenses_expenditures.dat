40|$|We {{examine whether}} managers' {{decisions}} to capitalize or <b>expense</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> convey {{information about the}} future performance of the firm. Focusing on a French setting where managers can choose to capitalize R&D expenditures under certain circumstances, we find that, after controlling for industry effects, firms that capitalize R&D expenditures spend less on R&D, have more volatile R&D efforts, and are smaller and more leveraged than firms that <b>expense</b> R&D <b>expenditures.</b> We also find that capitalizers capitalize R&D outlays {{when they need to}} meet or beat thresholds. Finally, we show that the decision to capitalize R&D is generally associated with a negative or neutral impact on future performance, even after controlling for self-selection. Our results also show that when firms both capitalize and <b>expense</b> R&D <b>expenditures,</b> the <b>expensed</b> portion exhibits a stronger (and negative) relationship with future performance. Market-based tests corroborate these findings. While we cannot unambiguously establish whether our findings imply that management uses R&D capitalization to manage earnings or because it is unable to estimate the earning power of R&D projects, our results suggest that management is unable to truthfully convey information about future performance through its decision to capitalize R&D. Our findings, based on real data as opposed to simulated data, therefore contrast with previous supportive evidence in favor of capitalization in the literature. ...|$|R

MethodsPatients who had at least one service claim either as an outpatient or inpatient between the years 2004 and 2007 and were over 15 years of age with a primary diagnosis of ALS were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Additionally, ALS patients with serious disability database certificates over 15 years of age were included for the calculation of incidence and prevalence between the years 1999 and 2008. Lastly, the total medical expenditure, including ventilator use and riluzole, were reported. ResultsIn 2006 and 2008, the average annual incidence and prevalence of ALS was 0. 51 and 1. 97 (per 105), respectively, in Taiwan. The male-to-female ratio of incidence for ALS was 1. 67. The average medical expenditure for ALS patients stayed steady at 16 -fold greater than the general population of Taiwan in 2008.
