60|$|But the {{development}} of his manufacture of rubber was an entirely different business, {{and for a time}} profoundly interesting. It took him into a new astonishing world, the world of large-scale manufacture and industrial organization. The actual planning of the works was not in itself anything essentially new to him. So far as all that went it was scarcely more than the problem of arranging an experiment upon a huge and permanent scale, and all that quick ingenuity, that freshness and directness of mind that had made his purely scientific work so admirable had ample and agreeable scope. Even the importance of cost and economy at every point in the process involved no system of considerations that was altogether novel to him. The British investigator knows only too well the necessity for husbanded material and inexpensive substitutes. But strange factors came in, a new region of interest was opened with the fact that instead of one experimenter working with the alert responsive assistance of Durgan, a multitude of human beings--even in the first drafts of his project they numbered already two hundred, before the <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> could be considered--had to watch, control, assist or perform every stage in a long elaborate synthesis. For {{the first time in his}} life Trafford encountered the reality of Labour, as it is known to the modern producer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Technological advancements {{in various}} domains have broadened the {{application}} horizon of robotics to an incredible extent. Highlighting a very recent application area, {{this paper presents}} {{a comprehensive review of}} robotics application in food industry. Robots essentially have the potential to transform the processes in food processing <b>and</b> <b>handling,</b> palletizing <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> food serving. Therefore, recent years witnessed tremendously increased trend of robots deployment in food sector. Consequently, the aspects related with robot kinematics, dynamics, hygiene, economic efficiency, human-robot interaction, safety and protection and operation and maintenance are of critical importance and are discussed in the present review. A comparison of actual robots being used in the industry is also presented. The review reveals that the food serving sector is the new potential area in which ample research opportunities exist by integrating advancements from various technology domains. It is anticipated that wider dissemination of research developments in &# 8216;robo-food&# 8217; will stimulate more collaborations among the research community and contribute to further developments...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the project}} was to assess the {{exposure}} of workers to ultrafine particles released during <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> of carbon black. The assessment included the results of the measurements performed in a carbon black handling plant before, during, and after work shift. Material and Methods: The number concentration of particles within the dimension range 10 – 1000 nm and 10 – 100 nm was assayed by a condensation particle counter (CPC). The mass concentration of particles was determined by a DustTrak II DRX aerosol concentration monitor. The surface area concentration of the particles potentially deposited in the alveolar (A) and tracheo-bronchial (TB) regions was estimated by an AeroTrak 9000 nanoparticle monitor. Results: An average mass concentration of particles during the process was 6 -fold higher than that before its start, while a 3 -fold increase in the average number concentration of particles within the dimension range 10 – 1000 nm and 10 – 100 nm was observed during the process. At the same time a 4 -fold increase was found in the surface area concentration of the particles potentially deposited in the A and TB regions. Conclusions: During the process of carbon black <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> a significantly higher values of each of the analysed parameters, characterizing the exposure to ultrafine particles, were noted.

40|$|The litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a {{tropical}} to subtropical fruit. It {{is a popular}} export commodity due to its attractive skin colour and exotic flavour. The fruit has a rough indehiscent pericarp (skin) surrounding the succulent, edible aril and a seed in the centre. Pericarp browning, postharvest decay and micro-cracking are identified as major constraints affecting the commercial quality of litchi during storage, transportation or at the consumer shelf. Desiccation or moisture loss from the pericarp and mechanical injury due to improper postharvest handling practices during the fruit export chain ultimately result in browning. Micro-cracking was also observed preharvestly during fruit developmental stages, and postharvestly due to poor <b>handling</b> practices <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> line operations. The micro-cracks on the pericarp act as ports of entry for the invasion of postharvest pathogens during cold storage and transportation. Although pericarp browning caused by desiccation does not severely affect the sensory attributes of litchis, mechanical injury and postharvest decay can cause deleterious effects on the sensory attributes of litchi fruit. Pericarp browning and postharvest decay during storage and transportation are currently controlled by adopting sulphur dioxide fumigation in many litchi exporting countries. However, sulphur dioxide fumigation leaves undesirable residues, alters the fruit taste and results in health hazards for consumers and packhouse workers. This review summarises {{the latest developments in}} alternative treatments to replace sulphur dioxide fumigation in the litchi postharvest managemen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In general, {{small-scale}} vegetables farmers experience {{problems in}} improving the safety and quality of vegetables supplied to high-class consumers in modern retailers.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{involved in}} the automated packing and nesting of irregular shapes are not only of theoretical importance, but have considerable industrial interest. The ability to manipulate objects under visual control {{is one of the}} key tasks in the successful implementation of robotic, automated assembly and adaptive material handling systems. Such systems must be capable of dealing with a wide range of variable products and of operating in industrial environments that are not overly constrained. These systems will need to include the ability to manipulate arbitrary shapes in a flexible manner. Therefore, to automate this part of the manufacturing process we need to develop automated material handling systems that combine machine vision techniques and flexible packing strategies. A rich theoretical background to the problems that occur in the automation of material handling can be found in operations research, production engineering, systems engineering and automation, more specifically machine vision, literature. This work has contributed towards the design of intelligent handling systems. This paper will review the application of these automated material <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> techniques to industrial problems. The discussion will also highlight the systems integration issues {{involved in the}}se applications. An outline of one such industrial application, the automated placement of shape templates on to leather hides, is also discussed. The purpose of this system is to arrange shape templates on a leather hide in an efficient manner, so as to minimize the leather waste, before they are automatically cut from the hide. These pieces are used in the furniture and car manufacturing industries for the upholstery of high quality leather chairs and car seats. Currently this type of operation is semi-automated.

The declustering stage iteratively ungroups a set of the previously clustered modules (i. e., perform tree expansion) and then refines the floorplanning/placement solution by using a simulated annealing scheme. In particular, the MB*-tree preserves the geometric relations among modules during declustering, which makes the MB*-tree an ideal data structure for the multilevel floorplanning/placement framework. Experimental results show that the MB*-tree obtains significantly better silicon area and wirelength than previous works.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about educating the packing {{engineers}} at Scania to their best potential. The education {{is made by}} developing an E-course adapted specially for the packing engineers at Scania. Content of the E-course was defined through analysis of literature, science articles and interviews with the packing engineers it was also decided from analysis. Reason why the packing engineers needed this education is because the packing engineers decisions has {{a big impact on}} the company. So it is therefore important that the packing engineers consider different parameters when deciding how the final package should look. One way to improve the packing engineers work is by the virtual packing software Pack-Assistant which is used to pack CAD-files, which is much more quicker then manual <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> efficient. The main purpose with this thesis is to investigate which parameters has to be taken in to consideration for the most efficient <b>packing</b> (<b>and</b> what is efficient from different perspectives). How do packaging influence logistic and vice versa and how to adapt the E-course in the most optimal way. The projects main purpose was to study different E-course educational methods, analysis of how Pack-Assistant works, observation of packages in Scania, experiments was conducted to see how real packages differ when the same parts was simulated in Pack-Assistant. Where it was concluded that Pack-Assistant was a more pack efficient {{for the majority of the}} tested parts. From the comparison it was also concluded that Scania could save 13 % of their freight cost, container cost <b>and</b> internal <b>handling</b> cost just from packing in Pack-Assistant. One other major result from the analysis is that packing engineers prefer to pack the number of parts with even “nice” numbers like 10, 20, 50, 100, etc. Which is a great problem economically for Scania, sometimes it is more efficient to pack with 11 parts instead of 10 parts. It was also observed how the setting in Pack-Assistant had for effect on the <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> also in which circumstances to use the different packing structures in the software.

40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} in energy-efficient scheduling in data centers, Khuller, Li, and Saha introduced the machine activation problem as a generalization {{of the classical}} optimization problems of set cover and load balancing on unrelated machines. In this problem, a set of n jobs have to be distributed among a set of m (unrelated) machines, given the processing time of each job on each machine, where each machine has a startup cost. The goal is to produce a schedule of minimum total startup cost subject to a constraint L on its makespan. While Khuller et al considered the offline version of this problem, a typical scenario in scheduling is one where jobs arrive online {{and have to be}} assigned to a machine immediately on arrival. We give an (O((mn) m), O(m)) -competitive randomized online algorithm for this problem, i. e. the schedule produced by our algorithm has a makespan of O(L m) with high probability, and a total expected startup cost of O((mn) m) times that of an optimal offline schedule with makespan L. The competitive ratios of our algorithm are (almost) optimal. Our algorithms use the online primal dual framework introduced by Alon et al for the online set cover problem, and subsequently developed further by Buchbinder, Naor, and co-authors. To the best of our knowledge, all previous applications of this framework have been to linear programs (LPs) with either packing or covering constraints. One novelty of our application is that we use this framework for a mixed LP that has both covering <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> constraints. We hope that the algorithmic techniques developed in this paper to simultaneously <b>handle</b> <b>packing</b> <b>and</b> covering constraints will be useful for solving other online optimization problems as well...|$|R
