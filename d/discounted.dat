40|$|Researchers in {{different}} disciplines have independently found {{evidence to suggest}} that the social <b>discount</b> rate may be hyperbolic, rather than exponential, in nature. Both behaviorist research and some empirical economics studies support the hyperbolic <b>discounting</b> hypothesis. U. S. and U. K. government <b>discounting</b> dispensations for some long-run public development projects are explicable in terms of an underlying hyperbolic social <b>discount</b> rate. A statistical aggregation argument demonstrates that even if the behaviorist, economics and public choice evidence for hyperbolic <b>discounting</b> is not conclusive, the social <b>discount</b> rate of a set of people who individually express time preferences best modeled by exponential <b>discounting</b> functions is nonetheless hyperbolic. Further empirical economics studies of <b>discounting</b> preferences are required.
