5|$|Thatcher {{was born}} Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Her father was Alfred Roberts from Northamptonshire {{and her mother}} was Beatrice Ethel (née Stephenson) from Lincolnshire. She spent her {{childhood}} in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. Prior to the Second World War, in 1938 the Roberts family gave sanctuary to a teenage Jewish <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> escaped from Nazi Germany. Aged 12, Margaret and her sister Muriel saved pocket money {{to help pay for}} the teenager's journey.|$|E
5|$|Jane sits at {{her kitchen}} table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one of her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> fallen from the window of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most {{of history}} the {{mortality}} rate of TBI {{was thought to be}} 100%. However, in 1871 a healed TBI was noted in a duck that had been killed by a hunter, thus demonstrating that the injury could be survived, at least in the general sense. This report, made by Winslow, was the first record in the medical literature of a bronchus injury. In 1873, Seuvre made one of the earliest reports of TBI in the medical literature: a 74-year-old woman whose chest was crushed by a wagon wheel was found on autopsy to have an avulsion of the right bronchus. Long-term survival of the injury was unknown in humans until a report was made of a person who survived in 1927. In 1931, a report made by Nissen described successful removal of a lung in a 12-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had narrowing of the bronchus due to the injury. Repair of TBI was probably first attempted in 1945, when the first documented case of a successful suturing of a lacerated bronchus was made. Prior to 1950, {{the mortality rate}} was 36%; it had fallen to 9% by 2001; this improvement was likely due to improvements in treatments and surgical techniques, including those for injuries commonly associated with TBI.|$|E
5|$|Using his mother's case files, Bruce finds a {{connection}} to a Southeast Asian country named Udon Khai. Using the assumed name Big Jack Hollister, Batman travels to San Francisco to meet a contact who explains how the sex tours to Udon Khai operate. As Hollister, Batman travels to Udon Khai, where he meets Rhama, a local translator hired by Alfred. Rhama shows him life in Udon Khai and how the child sex tourism has affected its population. As Batman, Bruce introduces himself to Rhama, saying that Hollister sent him. Batman and Rhama confront a man who buys and sells children and they rescue a <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been sold by her family. They return the child to her village and find {{that her father had}} sold her so {{that the rest of the}} poverty-stricken family could survive. The population mistakes Batman for a warrior of legend who would break the barriers that confine the population. Believing this to be their chance for a revolution to overthrow the military dictatorship, a rebel group joins Batman in storming the headquarters of the kingpin who controls the sex tourism industry. Though Batman returns to Gotham City, the rebels continue to dismantle the sex tour industry and overthrow the dictator of Udon Khai.|$|E

Fifty-four percent of the girls questioned have had the Kinaalda'. Significant differences between the <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> the ceremony and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not had the ceremony were found, using a chi square test of significance at an alpha level of. 05, in the frequency of a set of traditional characteristics.

25|$|The ALRA {{was very}} active between 1936 and 1939 sending {{speakers}} {{around the country}} to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA’s Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA. This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1947, {{hundreds}} of mostly poor peasants gathered at Portella della Ginestra, three {{kilometers from the}} town of Piana degli Albanesi on the way to San Giuseppe Jato for the traditional international Labour Day parade. At 10:15, the Communist party secretary from Piana degli Albanesi began to address the crowd when gunfire broke out. It was later determined that machine guns had been fired from the surrounding hills, as well as by men on horseback. Eleven people were killed, including four children, Serafino Lascari (15), Giovanni Grifò (12), Giuseppe Di Maggio and Vincenzo La Fata, both seven years old. Thirty-three people were wounded, including a little <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> her jaw shot off.|$|E

25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Comanche chiefs brought {{only one}} white captive to the meeting, {{as well as}} several Mexican {{children}} who had been captured separately.

The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been held prisoner for over a year and a half. Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost sixty years after the event that Lockhart had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages, {{scientific}} discoveries were {{few and far}} between in much of Europe. However, the scientific culture flourished {{in other parts of the}} world. By AD 700, the tracheotomy was well documented in Indian and Arabian literature, although it was rarely practiced on humans. In 1000, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (936-1013), an Arab who lived in Al-Andalus, published the 30-volume Kitab al-Tasrif, the first illustrated work on surgery. He never performed a tracheotomy, but he did treat a slave <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> cut her own throat in a suicide attempt. Al-Zahrawi (known to Europeans as Albucasis) sewed up the wound and the girl recovered, thereby proving that an incision in the larynx could heal. Circa 1020, Ibn Sīnā (980–1037) described the use of tracheal intubation in The Canon of Medicine to facilitate breathing. In the 12th century medical textbook Al-Taisir, Ibn Zuhr (1091–1161) of Al-Andalus (also known as Avenzoar) provided an anatomically correct description of the tracheotomy operation.|$|E
