50|$|If {{the tube}} is overloaded, {{not only can}} the plate warp, causing a short to outer grids or {{beam-shaping}} elements, but the emissive layer on the cathode will be consumed very quickly. The equipment's power supply and the tube's load (output <b>transformers,</b> <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers,</b> etc.) {{are likely to be}} damaged by a sustained overload condition, so power should be immediately disconnected when a glowing plate is found.|$|R
50|$|MPP cores are {{primarily}} used in inductors {{that require a}} core to have higher saturation point while maintaining other valuable magnetic properties. A standard MPP core saturates at around 7500 Gauss. A ferrite core saturates at around 4500 Gauss. Molypermalloy powder cores are commonly used in the making of: <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers,</b> resonant circuits, quartz filters, loading coils, choke coils, pulse transformers, and other industrial and military circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> {{is used in}} the {{operation}} of CRT-display devices such as television sets and CRT computer monitors. The voltage and frequency can each range over a wide scale depending on the device. For example, a large color TV CRT may require 20 to 50 kV with a horizontal scan rate of 15.734 kHz for NTSC devices. Unlike a power (or [...] "mains") transformer which uses an alternating current of 50 or 60 hertz, a <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> typically operates with switched currents at much higher frequencies in the range of 15 kHz to 50 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Air gaps can {{be created}} in the cores of certain {{transformers}} to reduce the effects of saturation. This increases the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and enables it to store more energy before core saturation. This effect is also used in the <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>flyback</b> <b>{{transformer}}</b> (FBT), {{also called}} a line output transformer (LOPT), {{is a special}} type of electrical transformer. It was initially designed to generate high voltage sawtooth signals at a relatively high frequency. In modern applications, it is used extensively in switched-mode power supplies for both low (3 V) and high voltage (over 10 kV) supplies.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic flux in a {{ferromagnetic}} material, {{such as the}} core, {{causes it}} to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or transformer hum. This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers</b> associated with television CRTs.|$|R
50|$|An alloy {{of about}} 50%-50% of nickel and iron. High energy storage, {{saturation}} flux density of about 1.5 tesla. Residual flux density near zero. Used in applications with high DC current bias (line noise filters, or inductors in switching regulators) or where low residual flux density is needed (e.g. pulse and <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers,</b> the high saturation {{is suitable for}} unipolar drive), especially where space is constrained. The material is usable up to about 200 kHz.|$|R
50|$|An alloy of 6% aluminium, 9% silicon, and 85% iron. Core losses {{higher than}} MPP. Very low magnetostriction, makes low audio noise. Loses {{inductance}} with increasing temperature, {{unlike the other}} materials; can be exploited by combining with other materials as a composite core, for temperature compensation. Saturation flux of about 1 tesla. Good temperature stability. Used in switching power supplies, pulse and <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers,</b> in-line noise filters, swing chokes, and in filters in phase-fired controllers (e.g. dimmers) where low acoustic noise is important.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary winding}} of the <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> {{is driven by}} a switch from a DC supply (usually a transistor). When the switch is {{switched}} on, the primary inductance causes the current to build up in a ramp. An integral diode connected in series with the secondary winding prevents the formation of secondary current that would eventually oppose the primary current ramp.|$|E
50|$|To {{make the}} plasma speaker a more widely {{available}} product, ExcelPhysics, a Seattle-based company, and Images Scientific Instruments, a New York-based company, both offered their own {{variant of the}} plasma speaker as a DIY kit. The ExcelPhysics variant uses a <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> to step up voltage, a 555 timing chip to provide modulation and a 44 kHz carrier signal, and an audio amplifier.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> circuit {{was invented}} {{as a means}} of {{controlling}} the horizontal movement of the electron beam in a cathode ray tube (CRT). Unlike conventional transformers, a <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> is not fed with a signal of the same waveshape as the intended output current. A convenient side effect of such a transformer is the considerable energy that is available in its magnetic circuit. This can be exploited using extra windings {{that can be used to}} provide power to operate other parts of the equipment. In particular, very high voltages are easily obtained using relatively few turns of winding which, once rectified, can provide the very high accelerating voltage for a CRT. Many more recent applications of such a transformer dispense with the need to produce high voltages and just use the device as a relatively efficient means of producing a wide range of lower voltages using a transformer much smaller than a conventional mains transformer would be.|$|E
50|$|Powdered iron is the {{cheapest}} material. Has higher core loss {{than the more}} advanced alloys, but this can be compensated for by making the core bigger; it is advantageous where cost {{is more important than}} mass and size. Saturation flux of about 1 to 1.5 tesla. Relatively high hysteresis and eddy current loss, operation limited to lower frequencies (approx. below 100 kHz). Used in energy storage inductors, DC output chokes, differential mode chokes, triac regulator chokes, chokes for power factor correction, resonant inductors, and pulse and <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers.</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{advantage}} of operating the transformer at the flyback frequency {{is that it}} can be much smaller and lighter than a comparable transformer operating at mains (line) frequency. Another advantage is that it provides a failsafe mechanism — should the horizontal deflection circuitry fail, the <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> will cease operating and shut down the rest of the display, preventing the screen burn that would otherwise result from a stationary electron beam.|$|E
50|$|The {{high voltage}} power {{supplies}} of CRT type television sets and computer monitors generate voltages of 30 - 40 kV, {{which are a}} much greater electrocution hazard. This higher voltage requires higher value bleeder resistors to avoid unnecessarily loading the supply circuits. The bleeder resistor commonly found inside a <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> is valued {{in the hundreds of}} megohms range, and can therefore not be measured with the common technician's multimeter.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are often}} {{auxiliary}} windings that produce lower voltages for driving {{other parts of}} the television circuitry. The voltage used to bias the varactor diodes in modern tuners is often derived from the <b>flyback</b> <b>transformer</b> ("Line OutPut Transformer" [...] LOPT). In tube sets, a one or two-turn filament winding is located {{on the opposite side of}} the core as the HV secondary, used to drive the HV rectifier tube's heater.|$|E
40|$|Sandia {{has used}} <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers</b> for many years, {{primarily}} to charge capacitors for capacitive discharge units. Important {{characteristics of the}} transformer design are to meet inductance, turns ratio, and high voltage breakdown requirements as well as not magnetically saturating during each energy transfer cycle. Sandia has taken over production responsibility for magnetic components from a previous GE/LM, General Electric/Lockheed Martin, facility in Florida that produced {approximately} 50 K units per year. Vanguard Electronics is working with Sandia to transfer many of these designs to Vanguard`s small manufacturing facility in Gardena, CA. The challenge is to achieve the required high reliability and meet all the other electrical requirements with such small quantities of parts, {approximately} 100 per year. DOE requirements include high reliability {le} 3 failures per 10, 000 components per 20 years while meeting numerous other environmental requirements. The basic design and prove-in required four lots of preproduction parts, extensive environmental testing, and numerous design changes. The manufacturing problems that affected performance of the transformer will be presented. These include encapsulation voids and core alignment.

40|$|For every solar panel, {{there is}} an {{inverter}} which transforms the harvested DC electricity into AC electricity {{so that it can}} connect to the grid and power household appliances. In this project, we examined a tandem solar cell being designed by Iris Photovoltaics which has two layers with two distinct outputs, and we explored several solutions to create a microinverter which can handle dual inputs from the tandem PV and combine them into a single AC output. To examine the viability of such a microinverter, we designed and simulated the DC-DC combination portion of the specialized dual input microinverter, resulting in a working circuit simulation using <b>flyback</b> <b>transformers</b> which can take two DC inputs at different voltage and current levels and combine them together into a single high voltage on the DC bus, ready to be transformed into AC. We also purchased an already existing dual input microinverter and tested it by connecting it with two different solar panels and measuring its performance, however we could not obtain useful results because it did not function as intended. Overall the dual input microinverter is an interesting technology involving maximum power point tracking, DC combination, and power electronics.

The high frequency (15 kHz or so) of the horizontal scanning allows reasonably small components to be used.|$|E
50|$|The flyback {{converter}} {{is used in}} both AC/DC and DC/DC conversion with galvanic isolation between the input and any outputs.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of energy or signals to a rotating device is generally carried out by systems with sliding contacts. This technology, apparently simple, generates serious nuisance such as abrasion of the elements in contact, electric noises and requires a relatively important volume. These devices, of limited life cycle, generally request quite expensive maintenance. The {{transmission of}} energy or information by induction seems then an interesting alternative to this technology. In fact, the constant evolution of electronic components and ferromagnetic materials developed for high frequency power applications opens the way to reliable, integrated and economical system supplied by induction. This thesis can be a useful reference document {{to make a choice}} and to design an energy and/or information transmission device by induction, based on the principle of the transformer. Various solutions with or without carried ferrite structures are proposed, also for different geometries including all invariance of the system parameters in relation to the rotation speed and the angular position. The first part of this work presents some high frequency converters integrating a <b>transformer</b> (<b>Flyback,</b> Forward…). This approach shows their possibilities {{as well as some of}} the corresponding elements of design. This part demonstrates also the interest of using sinusoidal signals to limit the disturbances caused by the power transmission system. Several calculation models of inductances, of the heating, of the iron losses and of the transformer (equivalent electric model) have been developed. Then different rotating transformers, the most adapted to this kind of transmission, have been designed. After validation and implementation of these models into a design software, several examples have been achieved and also integrated into a real system. The second part of this study is devoted to the transmission of information by induction. From the start, the transformer appears as a band pass type hence, penalizing the transmission modes using low and null frequencies. The transmission modes of certain communication systems are compatible with the characteristics of the transformer and then the information transformer is inserted directly within the data communication channel, without any other electronic components. In the contrary case, the modulation intervenes like an alternative to the transmission in baseband and proves to be an adapted solution when the transmission of power generates disturbances in the data communication channel of information (coupling between the two systems). In this case the modulation allows to separate the two respective spectra (disturbances and information) so that a filter device eliminates the disturbances without deteriorating the signal carrying information. Various approaches to transmit information were approached and are presented in this work. Design methods are also proposed. Besides, various developments show at the same time the feasibility and the obvious interest of these principles...|$|R
