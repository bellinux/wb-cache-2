[...] The newsletters also criticized the state of Israel. One investment letter called Israel “an aggressive, national socialist state”; a <b>1990</b> <b>newsletter</b> discussed the “tens of thousands of well-placed friends of Israel in all countries {{who are willing to}} work for the Mossad in their area of expertise”; one quoted a [...] "Jewish friend" [...] who said the 1993 World Trade Center bombing was a [...] "setup by the Israeli Mossad".|$|R

5000|$|The first newsletters {{were mostly}} bird reports, annual reports and interim reports. In 1980 {{for the first}} time a real “Newsletter” was produced. It was only a single page and the bird reports were still {{published}} as well. September 1981 brought another newsletter, this time of four pages, and by June 1982 the newsletter had eleven pages, and had incorporated the annual and interim reports. The next newsletter in May 1983 looked much more professional, with text in two columns and photos, and stated that it was now “registered as a newspaper”. From then on, newsletters and records (both in two column-print and with photos), alternately appeared, a newsletter in summer and the records in spring. From October 1984 the name of the editor, Stuart Chambers, was given. He actually became editor in 1983 [...] and would remain until August 1996. The last “Records” showed up in November 1988. From then on the newsletter appeared bi-annually until <b>1990,</b> when four <b>newsletters</b> were published. The <b>newsletter</b> of November <b>1990,</b> published as “Newsletter 1”, gives an account of the “Opening Ceremony” of the Shorebird Centre. From then on, 3 or 4 newsletters were published every year. No. 21, of May 1996 was the first newsletter with a cover in full colour. It had 44 pages and was called the “21st Birthday Issue”. It was then called “Miranda Naturalists' Trust News” {{for the first time}}, the title it still holds.|$|R
