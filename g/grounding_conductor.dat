25|$|A {{lightning}} protection installation on a watercraft comprises a lightning protector {{mounted on the}} top of a mast or superstructure, and a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> in contact with the water. Electrical conductors attach to the protector and run down to the conductor. For a vessel with a conducting (iron or steel) hull, the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> is the hull. For a vessel with a non-conducting hull, the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> may be retractable, attached to the hull, or attached to a centerboard.|$|E
25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or fuse box. If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|E
25|$|Electrical plugs with {{incorporated}} RCD {{are sometimes}} installed on appliances {{that might be}} considered to pose a particular safety hazard, for example long extension leads, which might be used outdoors, or garden equipment or hair dryers, which may be used near a bath or sink. Occasionally an in-line RCD {{may be used to}} serve a similar function to one in a plug. By putting the RCD in the extension lead, protection is provided at whatever outlet is used even if the building has old wiring, such as knob and tube, or wiring that does not contain a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|E
50|$|If a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> is also needed, it must {{be added}} {{in a way that}} will not {{interfere}} with the star-quad geometry. It should also be added in a geometric configuration that exposes the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> to equal interference from all four star-quad conductors. The most common solution is to wrap the star quad with a cylindrical <b>ground</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Replacement of {{obsolete}} NEMA 1 receptacles requires either rewiring with {{an additional}} <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> for a NEMA 5 receptacle, or a NEMA 5 receptacle complete with a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} for two-wire non-grounded configurations (when a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> is not available).|$|R
50|$|Any {{line that}} has a {{different}} impedance of the return path may be considered an unbalanced line. However, unbalanced lines usually consist of a conductor that is considered the signal line and another <b>conductor</b> that is <b>grounded,</b> or is ground itself. The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> often {{takes the form of}} a ground plane or the screen of a cable. The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> may be, and often is, common to multiple independent circuits. For this reason the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> may be referred to as common.|$|R
2500|$|The {{blades of}} a NEMA {{connector}} are identified within the dimensional standard as follows: 'G' identifies the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor,</b> 'W' identifies the (grounded) neutral conductor, and 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' are the [...] "hot" [...] line conductors. Single-phase connectors {{have only a}} single terminal identified as 'X' or two terminals, 'X' and 'Y'. Three-phase connectors will use 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, GFI {{receptacles}} {{can be used}} {{in cases}} where there is no <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor,</b> but they must be labeled as [...] "ungrounded". An ungrounded GFI receptacle will trip using the built-in [...] "test" [...] button, but will not trip using a GFI test plug, because the plug tests by shorting a small current from line to the non-existent ground.|$|E
2500|$|GFCIs are {{commonly}} available {{as an integral}} part of a receptacle or a circuit breaker installed in the distribution panelboard. GFCI receptacles invariably have rectangular faces and accept so-called Decora face plates, and can be mixed with regular outlets or switches in a multi-gang box with standard cover plates. In both Canada and the US older two-wire, ungrounded NEMA 1 receptacles may be replaced with NEMA 5 receptacles protected by a GFCI (integral with the receptacle or with the corresponding circuit breaker) in lieu of rewiring the entire circuit with a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor.</b> In such cases the receptacles must be labeled [...] "no equipment ground" [...] and [...] "GFCI protected"; GFCI manufacturers typically provide tags for the appropriate installation description.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€“ We have {{observed}} that {{the size and shape}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> of axial mode helical antennas have significant impact on the antenna gain. Of all the shapes considered, the <b>ground</b> <b>conductors</b> in the shape of truncated cone yield the highest increase in the antenna gain when compared to the antennas above the infinite ground plane. We have designed the optimal <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> for the specific helical antenna by optimizing the geometrical parameters of the truncated cone with the goal to maximize the antenna gain.

40|$|Helical antennas {{have been}} {{known for a long}} time, but the {{literature}} is overwhelmed with controversial information about their performance. We have systematically investigated helical antennas located above an infinite ground plane and obtained design curves. We have also observed that the shape and size of the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> have influence on the helical antenna performance. By optimizing the dimensions of <b>ground</b> <b>conductors</b> that have the form of a cup and a cone, we have significantly increased the antenna gain.

50|$|FMC {{may be used}} as an {{equipment}} <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> if specific provisions are met regarding the trade size and length of FMC used, depending on the amperage of the circuits contained in the conduit. In general, {{an equipment}} <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> must be pulled through the FMC with an ampacity suitable to carry the fault current likely imposed on the largest circuit contained within the FMC.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding {{conductor}} for grounding (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While metal conduit may sometimes be used as a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor,</b> the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are special}} {{provisions}} in the NEC for so-called technical equipment, mainly professional grade audio and video equipment supplied by so-called [...] "balanced" [...] 120 volt circuits. The center tap of a transformer is connected to ground, and the equipment is supplied by two line wires each 60 volts to ground (and 120 volts between line conductors). The center tap is not distributed to the equipment and no neutral conductor is used. These cases generally use a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> which is separated from the safety <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> specifically {{for the purposes of}} noise and [...] "hum" [...] reduction.|$|E

50|$|As {{power lines}} the aerial cable can serve also as <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> {{on the top}} of the pylon. It can be also {{installed}} in form of a separate strand on the conductor.

5000|$|Fig. 1 shows {{a signal}} cable S linking two {{electronic}} components, including the typical line driver and receiver amplifiers (triangles). [...] The cable has a <b>ground</b> or shield <b>conductor</b> which {{is connected to}} the chassis ground of each component. The driver amplifier in component 1 (left) applies signal V1 between the signal and <b>ground</b> <b>conductors</b> of the cable. At the destination end (right), the signal and <b>ground</b> <b>conductors</b> are connected to a differential amplifier. This produces the signal input to component 2 by subtracting the shield voltage from the signal voltage to eliminate common-mode noise picked up by the cableIf a current I from a separate source is flowing through the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor,</b> the resistance R of the conductor will create a voltage drop along the cable ground of IR, so the destination end of the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> will be at a different potential than the source end Since the differential amplifier has high impedance, little current flows in the signal wire, therefore there is no voltage drop across it: [...] The ground voltage appears to be in series with the signal voltage V1 and adds to it ...|$|R

5000|$|Tools with {{electric}} motors often have electrical safety features such as grounded cases (wired to a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor,</b> which uses the grounding prong on a plug) or double insulation. Some may have both, but more often not, because regulatory requirements require only one or the other.|$|E
50|$|In type NM cable, {{conductor}} insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor.</b> The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies {{that the black}} conductor represent the hot conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire {{may be used as}} the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method. Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.|$|E

50|$|Overhead {{power lines}} are often {{equipped}} with a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> (shield wire or overhead earth wire). The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> is usually <b>grounded</b> (earthed) {{at the top of}} the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors. In circuits with earthed neutral, it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two <b>ground</b> <b>conductors.</b> These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use surge arresters every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers (optical ground wires/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.|$|R
