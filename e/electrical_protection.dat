40|$|The {{generator}} {{differential protection}} {{is one of}} the most important <b>electrical</b> <b>protections</b> of synchronous generator stator windings. Its operation principle is based on the comparison of the input current and output current at each phase winding. Unwanted trip commands are usually caused by CT saturation, wrong CT selection, or the fact that they may come from different manufacturers. In generators grounded through high impedance, only phase-to-phase or three-phase faults can be detected by the differential protection. This kind of fault causes differential current to flow in, at least, two phases of the winding. Several cases of unwanted trip commands caused by the appearance of differential current in only one phase of the generator have been reported. In this paper multi-phase criterion is proposed for generator differential protection algorithm when applied to high impedance grounded generators...|$|R
