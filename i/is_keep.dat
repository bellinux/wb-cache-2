500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> it up".|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|Talks {{about the}} 2014 NBA draft began awkwardly when Paul Stauskas told Sports Illustrated about his son, Nik: [...] "He knows {{all he has}} to do <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> his nose to the {{grindstone}} for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility he might be able to go pro." [...] Several days later Stauskas tried to distance himself from his father's statement, apologizing to his fans. After the season Stauskas, Robinson and McGary said that they were considering entering the draft, but had not made a decision. Each submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which was required to respond by April 14 (giving the players until April 27 to declare their eligibility). On April 10 it was reported that Stauskas had decided to turn pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein (father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr.) as his agent. In an April 15 joint press conference on the Big Ten Network, Robinson and Stauskas announced that they were declaring their eligibility for the NBA draft. When he learned that he had tested positive for marijuana after the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary also entered the draft.|$|E

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows {{all he has to}} do <b>is</b> <b>keep</b> his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility he might be able to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

Brown was instrumental in putting together most of the songs on Muma Gee's debut full-length. In 2006, the album, entitled Kade was released as a CD to music stores. Muma Gee had explained the meaning of its title in an interview, [...] "it is a courageous word that gives hope. I believe so much in empowerment.
