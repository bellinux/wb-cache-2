Three bryozoan {{species are}} {{described}} from the uppermost {{part of the}} Velbert Formation (uppermost Famennian, “Strunian”) from the classical section Ratingen-Cromford (northwestern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Velbert <b>Anticline,</b> western Rhenish Massif, Germany). The described fauna includes one new genus Ratingella gen. n., one new species Crustopora fistulosa sp. n., and one species in open nomenclature, Nikiforovella sp. The hitherto known bryozoans from the “Strunian ” <b>of</b> the Velbert <b>Anticline</b> constitute the most important bryozoan fauna from the Famennian ‘Condroz Shelf’, bordering on the southwestern coast of Laurussia between southwestern England and Pomerania (northern Poland). Coinciding, {{it is the most}} diverse European bryozoan fauna from that time slice. Facies differences along the northwestern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Velbert <b>Anticline</b> between a clear-water ramp segment in the southwest and a marl ramp segment in the northeast are responsible for a completely different faunal association. Encrusting taxa diminish towards the north, while erect growing, branched taxa predominate and the general diversity increases. The studied fauna points to connections with the Asiatic part of Russia, Kazakhstan, and China and implies a general Palaeotethyan character for latest Famennian bryozoans in Eurasia...|$|R

The synthesis of outcrop (original geological field mapping at 1 : 10, 000 scale) and subsurface data sets from the early Pleistocene stratigraphic succession of the Peri-Adriatic basin provides {{a window into the}} overall evolutionary pattern of large intraslope turbidite systems that, during the Gelasian (2. 58 – 1. 80  Ma), shed Apennine-derived clastic sediments into the adjacent deep-water basin.

During early and middle Gelasian time, coarse-grained turbidite deposition occurred on the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the intraslope <b>anticline</b> by westerly sourced, northward-flowing turbidity currents, indicating that the opposing sea-floor topography was sufficient to cause the diversion of turbidite systems, forcing them to travel near parallel to the east-facing regional paleoslope for significant distances.

For this purpose, results of image log, core data, graphic well log, methods of inscribed circle analysis and curvature changes geometry <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> were analyzed. Asmari formation is the main reservoir rock in Marun oilfield that divided into five zones. Limestone and dolomite are the main lithology of zones 1, 2 and 3 which has a high density of fractures (especially in zones with 90 % dolomite). Also there is less fracture density (micro fracture) in the 4 and 5 Asmari zone due to an increase of shale and marl layers and due to less break ablity has a less distribution of fractures.

The mud volcanoes {{from the}} Berca {{region of the}} Buzău County are the most {{representative}} sites of mud volcanoes in Romania, {{and one of the}} most significant geological sites of the Buzău Land Geopark. These mud volcanoes occur on an anticline situated in the inner extremity of the Foreland zone of the Eastern Carpathians. The ocurrence of this phenomenon is linked, as in other world regions, to the highly developed diapirisim of the area; mud migrates at the surface throughout faulted <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline,</b> from Middle Miocene deposits at a depth of around 3, 000 m. Two sites of the Berca area, namely Pâclele Mari and Pâclele Mici, have been studied in detail, by field observation and GPS surveys.

40|$|Transient {{pressure}} variations {{within a}} reservoir {{can be treated}} as a propagating front and analyzed using an asymptotic formulation. From this perspective one can define a pressure 'arrival time' and formulate solutions along trajectories, in the manner of ray theory. We combine this methodology and a technique for mapping overburden deformation into reservoir volume change as a means to estimate reservoir flow properties, such as permeability. Given the entire 'travel time' or phase field, obtained from the deformation data, we can construct the trajectories directly, there-by linearizing the inverse problem. A numerical study indicates that, using this approach, we can infer large-scale variations in flow properties. In an application to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture (InSAR) observations associated with a CO{sub 2 } injection at the Krechba field, Algeria, we image pressure propagation to the northwest. An inversion for flow properties indicates a linear trend of high permeability. The high permeability correlates with a northwest trending fault on the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> which defines the field...|$|R
3000|$|The {{sector that}} {{developed}} from Zavrohon diapir up to Qafa Kicoku, has anticlinal structures with enormous dimensions, {{and it is}} represented by carbonate deposits (J 3 -Pg 2) which has in the core oldest deposists (the evaporites in the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Bureto <b>anticline,</b> Fig.  14), that are overthrust westward (Figs.  16, 17, etc.), rarely with a backthrust in the eastern flank (Nemercka and the Mitsikeli <b>anticlines).</b> The features <b>of</b> the backthrust on the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the structures are very developed in the Greek territory, because of the diapir effect (Figs.  12, 15). This phenomenon is generally developed in the later phases of the collision stage (Cr 2 -N 1 2 s [...]), due to the evaporite diapir tectonics and the reactive westward thrust process. In this sector (Fig.  14), two anticlinal structural lines developed: the Trebeshina and Nemercka anticlines {{in the east and}} the Goliko, Lunxheri and Bureto anticlines in the west. They are divided from one another by a narrow and shallow syncline, which is without any tectonic complication. The southern part of these structures has tectonic contact (in a synclinal tongue shape) with the evaporite diapir. Their anticlinal structures are very prolonged. The eastern line (Trebeshina, Nemercka and Mitsikeli anticline lines) continues northward with the Terpani and Berati anticlines, while the western one (Goliko, Lunxheri and Bureto anticline line) continue with only with Rehova anticline. The southern part <b>of</b> the Nemercka <b>anticline</b> (the biggest <b>of</b> the Berati belt) has a slight eastern asymmetry, and more to the south it passes into a fun shape, with an overturned backthrust in the east flank (Fig.  17), which is a result of an unsuccessful diapir. This anticline, near the Timfeu massive, is unified with the western line and is cut in two pieces from the Delvinakion cross fault (Fig.  14). The influence of the diapir is not noticeable in the Trebeshina anticline (Fig.  14), whose characteristics are similar to those we have seen throughout the Berati anticlinal belt. All the anticlines, mentioned above, are the brahi-anticlinal type. South to Qafa Kicoku (Fig.  14), an intrusive development of the evaporitic diapir is observed. The Zavrohon diapir, which is a surface diapir, is very intense in this sector, having developed a weak tectonic loop. This diapir is tectonically very complicated, which has influenced the structural model of the overlying deposits (Figs.  12, 14, 15). The structures of the western line (Bureto-Lunxheri-Goliko-Rehova) have western asymmetry and are limited by a regional fault that has an overthrust character (Figs.  14, 16, 17). To the south, the Bureto anticlinal has tectonic contact with the Zavrohon diapir {{and at the same time}} it appears in a specific view as a synclinal “tongue” and structural “nose” (Fig.  14). The Bureto anticline in its middle part has a monocline form, but to the north and south, it changes into the structural “nose” form (Fig.  14). The southern part has tectonic contact (in a synclinal tongue shape) with the Zavrohon diapir. The evaporites of Glina, which meet in the tectonic fault <b>of</b> the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Bureto <b>anticline,</b> are on the continuity of the Zavrohon diapir, which has helped the amplitude of the regional overthrust of the Berati anticlinal belt. Northward, the fault <b>of</b> the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Lunxheri <b>anticline</b> continues to the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Goliko <b>anticline</b> (Fig.  16) that looks like a horst under the influence of the unsuccessful diapir (Fig.  16). The <b>anticline</b> <b>of</b> Goliko has a fan-shape and development morphology. In this anticline, secondary structures are found. Besides the above characteristic, in the structures distinguished set up of them as “steps”. In addition, we see the existence of secondary folds in “nose” shape and with tectonic complications (Fig.  14).|$|R
40|$|Analyzing {{core data}} for {{fracture}} analysis is restricted by costs and gives limited information. Outcrop studies {{with the software}} DigiFract give a more complete set of information about fractures. The aim {{of this research is}} to find correlations between fractures patterns, lithology and tectonic position in the area around Coldigioco, Marche, Northern Apennines, Italy. In this area the current topography consists of two anticlinal structures with thrust origins. These thrusts originated during the Miocene {{as a result of the}} Corso-Sardinia-Calabria/Adria collision. The formations in this region consist of limestone and some chert/marl layers. To analyze the fracture patterns there are different ways of statistical processing, including determining fracture density, fracture orientation, fracture height and mechanical unit distributions. By correlating these statistics with lithology and tectonic location, the following can be concluded: The difference in fracture densities between the eastern and western <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> the eastern <b>anticline</b> are caused by an active axial surface fold. The dense fractured western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> is part <b>of</b> a deformed panel and the less dense fractured eastern <b>flank</b> is part <b>of</b> a undeformed panel of the fold. Furthermore one could conclude that the fracture pattern in the undeformed panel of the fold tends to be irregular due to the presence of an axial plane just above this panel. Parts of this panel have already been influenced by this upcoming change of bedding orientation or some parts have already passed this axial plane. The final conclusion related to tectonic position is that on the axial plane of a fold compressive stresses can cause stylolites perpendicular to the bedding. Two prominent influencing factors in lithology are the hardness of the rock and the presence of marl and chert layers. The formations of middle hardness are fractured regular. The opposite can be seen in the other, harder or softer formations. Finally one can conclude that marl and chert layers act as non-fractured or less fractured boundaries and cause bed confined fractures.

40|$|Presently adopted fracture-related {{permeability}} {{models of}} large folded reservoirs are simplistic and often {{unrelated to the}} geological setting and evolution of the considered structure. In order to improve predictions of fluid flow in more complex subsurface fractured reservoirs, we build a 3 D fracture network model of an outcropping fold in Tunisia, and populate different structural domains with fracture data, collected from outcrops. Within the studied fold, we find large variations in deformation mechanisms between different formations, with the main mechanisms being Layer Parallel Shortening (LPS), resulting in regional deformation, and the more localized impact of fiber stresses and flexural slip. Within the steep <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline,</b> we find that in one formation fracturing is mostly controlled by fiber stresses, whereas in the underlying formation flexural slip is the main deformation mechanism.

50|$|An {{overturned}} anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb {{that has}} been tilted beyond perpendicular so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip {{in the same direction}} {{on both sides of the}} axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70-120 degrees), then the fold is an open fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a tight fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth's surface), it will form Vs on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth's surface. All anticlines and synclines have some degree of plunge. Periclinal folds are a type <b>of</b> <b>anticlines</b> that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes.Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called synclines. They usually <b>flank</b> the sides <b>of</b> <b>anticlines</b> and display opposite characteristics. A syncline's oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A monocline is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the shape of a carpet draped over a stairstep.|$|R
40|$|Mass-wasting is an {{important}} process in the degradation of deep-water fold-and-thrust belts. However, the relationship between mass-transport complex (MTC) emplacement and the timing and spatial progression of contractional deformation of the seabed have not been extensively studied. This study uses high-quality, 3 D seismic reflection data from the southern Magdalena Fan, offshore Colombia to investigate how {{the growth of a}} deep-water fold-and-thrust belt (the southern Sinú Fold Belt) is recorded in the source, distribution and size of MTCs. More than nine distinct, but coalesced MTCs overlie a major composite basal erosion surface. This surface formed by multiple syn- and post-tectonic mass-wasting events and is thus highly diachronous, thereby recording a protracted period of tectonism, seascape degradation and associated sedimentation. The size and source location of these MTCs changed through time: the oldest ‘detached’ MTCs are relatively small (over 9 - 100 km 2 in area) and sourced from the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> growing <b>anticlines,</b> whereas the younger ‘shelf-attached’ MTCs are considerably larger (more than 200 - 300 km 2), are sourced from the shelf, and post-date the main phase of active folding and thrusting. Changes in the source, distribution and size of MTCs are tied to the sequential nucleation, amplification and along-strike propagation of individual structures, showing that MTCs can be used to constrain the timing and style of contractional deformation, and seascape evolution in time and space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present {{research}} studies sedimentary succession of Oligocene Asmari Formation at Tang-e Moshkan stratigraphic section aimed at evaluating lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy and determining microfacies, microfacies class, sub-environments, and sedimentary environment. The mentioned section at southern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Tamar <b>anticline</b> from <b>of</b> Sub-coastal Fars sub-basin located in folded Zagros. It was selected in boundary of Fars and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad provinces with a Thickness over than 350 m consisting of limestone and marly limestone strata. In this section, lower and upper boundaries of Asmari Formation are continuously located over Pabdeh and under Razak Formations as homoclinal ones, respectively. The studied thickness of Pabdeh and Razak Formations are respectively 241 m and 9 m in this section. Biostratigraphy studies conducted on 195 thin sections resulted in identification of 37 genus and 44 species of bentic foraminifera, 4 genus and 4 species of planktonic foraminifera {{along with some}} non-foraminifera, determination of Oligocene (Rupelian - Chattian), and Introduction of two assemblage zones that old to new, respectively:  1 - Nummulites vascus - Nummulites fichteli Assemblage Zone   2 - Archaias asmaricus / hensoni - Miogypsinoides complanatus Assemblage Zone Results of high resolution field and laboratory of observations and studies were embedded as recognition and classification of 8 microfacies class in 3 lagoon, shoal and open marine sedimentary sub-environments, all deposited on a carbonated platform of a homoclinal ramp...|$|R
40|$|Two {{trilobite}} species so far exclusive {{from the}} Dobrotivá Formation of the Prague Basin are {{reported for the}} first time outside Bohemia. The first is represented by a single specimen of Dindymene plasi Kielan, 1960 that occurs in Portugal within the Valongo Formation near Beloi, on the western <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Valongo <b>Anticline</b> (Central Iberian Zone). The second is Ectillaenus benignensis (Novák, 1918), recorded by eight articulated specimens which come from two different formations of the First Bani Group of the Moroccan eastern Anti-Atlas, located, respectively, in {{the upper part of the}} Guezzart Formation and near the top of the Ouine-Inirne Formation, both in the Jbel Bou Issidane section south of Alnif. All these occurrences are of Dobrotivian age (= late Darriwilian in the global timescale) and reinforce the palaeobiogeographical links within the north Gondwana platform. They are of special interest as it adds to a small group of species roughly coeval over a large area, and is of particular relevance for pre-Variscan palaeogeographic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC) exposes {{metasediment}} rocks overlain by Cretaceous ophiolites and intruded by granitoids. Following late Cretaceous exhumation of its high-grade metamorphic rocks, the CACC {{started to}} collide with the Central Pontides of southern Eurasia in the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene. Here, we present the sedimentary, stratigraphic and tectonic evolution of the Çiçekdağı Basin, located in the northwest of the CACC. Magnetostratigraphic dating, supported by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology, shows a late Eocene basin age. The basin fill unconformably overlies metamorphic basement {{in the south and}} ophiolites of the CACC in the north. It consists of red conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones, which overlie a sequence of nummulitic limestones. In the south, these limestones are ~ 10 m thick, are underlain by a few meters of conglomerate unit unconformably covering the CACC metamorphics. In the north, the limestones are underlain by a ~ 200 m thick sequence of volcanics and fine-grained clastics intercalating with shallow marine black shales. The upper Eocene sediments of the Çiçekdağı Basin were deformed into a syn-anticline pair. Progressive unconformities in the northern flank and a rapid and persistent ~ 180 ° switch in paleocurrent directions from southward to northward in the southern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> demonstrate syn-sedimentary folding. We interpret the folding to result from a southward progression of the Çankırı foreland basin as a result of ongoing collision between the CACC and the Pontides...|$|R
40|$|The Matagami mining camp is an {{important}} base metal producer in the Canadian Shield. The volcanic stratigraphy of the area is folded into the Galin•e anticline which is an east-west-trending and west-plunging regional fold. The south <b>flank</b> consists <b>of</b> a low strain do-main characterized by a southeast-trending volcanic sequence dipping moderately at 45 ø to the south. The stratigraphic succession iswell defined with the Watson Lake Group at the base, comprising alower dacitic unit and an upper quartz porphyritic rhyodacite unit. All {{but one of the}} deposits lie along the Key tuffite unit, located {{at the top of the}} Watson Lake Group. The north <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> is affected by a series of east-west- and northwest-trending high-angle reverse shears which defines the Lac Garon high strain zone. The volcanic se-quence within this zone is displaced into four overlapping sigmoidal segments in which strati-graphic reconstruction is possible. The Norita massive sulfide deposit, located in the center <b>of</b> the north <b>flank,</b> has been deformed and faulted. Its internal metal zonation and its underlying stringer zone were flattened and rotated. Its present geometry suggests hat it was deformed uring north side-up high-angle reverse movement. This sense of strain is compatible with the displacement of the marker units inside the Lac Garon high strain zone, and the morphological modifications are believed to be consistent with the movement within this zone. It is suggested that the Norita massive sulfide deposit is a deformed equivalent of the less deformed south flank massive sulfide deposits, and in contrast with an earlier suggestion ofa distal origin, shares the same genetic traits as the south flank deposits...|$|R
40|$|Koudiat Aïcha is a Visean stratiform, volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} (VMS) zinc–copper– lead deposit, situated {{northwest of}} Marrakech, within the Central Domain of the Jebilet massif of the Western Moroccan Meseta. The Central Domain is formed mainly of sedimentary (argillite, siltstone, sandstone, carbonate) and magmatic (gabbro and rhyodacite) rocks that host numerous massive sulphide deposits (e. g., Koudiat Aïcha, Kettara and Draa Sfar) {{in a thick}} grayish argillite sequence (rhythmic metapelite). The deposit is stratabound and consists of highly deformed, sheet-like lenses of massive sulphide located structurally on the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> a large <b>anticline.</b> Prior to metamorphism, the country rocks were subjected to hydrothermal alteration which is particularly pronounced {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the sulphide deposits where chloritization and sericitization are prevalent. Hydrothermal alteration extends into both the stratigraphic footwall and the stratigraphic hanging wall. The footwall lacks an obvious pipe zone (sulphide stringers or vent complex) beneath the sulphide mineralization, but is characterized by an increase in the modal proportion of Mg-chlorite and by the breakdown of feldspar and sericite. Chloritization, the most extensive and readil...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{a unique}} {{example of the}} intracontinental {{mountain}} building, the Cenozoic deformation of the Tian Shan has been widely studied. The onset of Cenozoic exhumation of the SW Chinese Tian Shan was constrained at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. However, the Cenozoic tectono-geomorphological growth process of the SW Chinese Tian Shan and adjacent piedmont basins remains a challenge. In this study, we carried out the geological mapping of satellite images and field investigations together with the apatite fission track (AFT) and detrital zircon U-Pb analyses to get further understanding of the Cenozoic tectonic deformation and geomorphological growth of the SW Chinese Tian Shan. Our {{results indicate that the}} exhumation of Maidan fault or topography growing of the Kokshaal Range commenced in the late Eocene ∼ Oligocene (35 - 25 Ma). Then, the structural deformation migrated southward to the Muziduke fault and the Atushi Basin Thrust (ABT) at ∼ 15 Ma. The growth strata of 6 - 3 Ma on the south <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Keketamu <b>Anticline</b> imply that tectonic deformation propagates further basinward. Furthermore, the uplift of the Kokshaal Range also strongly affected the evolution of piedmont basins. The results suggest that the Atushi Basin was still likely linked to the Aksai Basin during the early Miocene. They were separated into two independent basins since ca. 13. 7 - 10. 5 Ma, {{as a response to the}} rapid uplift of the Kokshaal Range. Finally, we infer that the southeastern part of dextral Talas-Fergana fault (TFF) is likely transferred to the NEE-trending thrust faults of the SW Chinese Tian Shan since ∼ 15 Ma...|$|R
