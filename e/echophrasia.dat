5000|$|Echolalia (also {{known as}} echologia or <b>echophrasia)</b> {{is defined as}} the {{unsolicited}} repetition of vocalizations made by another person (by the same person is called palilalia). In its profound form it is automatic and effortless. It is one of the echophenomena, closely related to echopraxia, the automatic repetition of movements made by another person; both are [...] "subsets of imitative behavior" [...] whereby sounds or actions are imitated [...] "without explicit awareness". [...] Echolalia may be an immediate reaction to a stimulus or may be delayed.|$|E
