500|$|The writers first {{detailed}} Cane as [...] "a smart, loyal, {{and moral}} survivalist with an edge". Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure to sort of find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but I think he has the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come <b>from.</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is holding out in his refusal to sign {{that that is the}} case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tina Fey {{has said}} that Liz' {{relationship}} with Jack is [...] "somewhere between Mary Tyler Moore and Lou Grant, and Han Solo and Princess Leia." [...] Fey previously stated that {{there would not be}} a romantic relationship between the two, as it would be [...] "too icky." [...] More recently, however, she admitted there is sexual tension between Jack and Liz. Jack passes Liz off as his girlfriend to make ex-wife Bianca jealous and Bianca tells Liz in one scene that [...] "I can tell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> [...] looks at you that he's serious". Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, thinks that Liz is a perfect match for Jack. In [...] "Do-Over", Jack and Liz attempt to win over temporary head of GE, Kathy Geiss by pretending to have a soap opera-style real life relationship, escalating to the point where Geiss wants the two to kiss each other (her shouting [...] "KISS!" [...] marks the only time Kathy Geiss has spoken in the entire series); there is a pause, but Jack and Liz refuse.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Roaring Reggie" [...] came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would {{shout at}} the Japanese guards. This {{subjected}} him to many beatings. Standing {{up for his}} men was his main focus. He would do whatever was necessary to protect them and keep them alive. He found that feigning displays of respect for Warrant Officer Aitaro [...] "Tiger" [...] Hiramatusu, the Japanese camp commander, brought more benefits than acts of defiance. [...] But {{it was a fine}} line to walk. In an interview with Pattie Wright for her book [...] "The Men of the Line," [...] Len, a 2/19th member recalled how Captain Newton got on the [...] "Tiger's" [...] better side. [...] "The 'Tiger' was a bad one but Reggie got around him. [...] We saw comfort women come into our camp. [...] They were in the last carriage of one of the trains going through. [...] In fact [...] "The Tiger" [...] asked Reggie if he wanted women to come into the camp. [...] I wasn't around for this exchange, but I heard Reggie said he'd prefer a few more bags of rice instead of women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powerfully built, Marsh was {{regarded}} as an all rounder {{for the majority of}} his career. Coupled with his short stature, his power suited him to the task of keeping wicket. [...] Despite his bulk, which forced him to work heavily on reducing his weight in his early career, he had fast feet movement, combined with fast anticipation and reflexes which allowed him to cover more ground. He raised the role of wicketkeeper to a more prominent status in a team with his acrobatic diving, raucous appeals and habit of throwing a ball high into the air upon completing a dismissal. [...] As the wicketkeeper, he made himself the focal point in the field and attempted to extract higher standards of concentration from both himself and his team-mates. Speaking of his understanding with Lillee, he said [...] "I've played with him so much now that most of the time I know what he is going to do before he has bowled" [...] Marsh said, [...] "I know <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be." ...|$|E

40|$|Thomas Reid’s {{theory of}} sensory {{perception}} {{has been widely}} examined in recent years. Commentators have been more or less united in the claim that Reid treats the visual perception of the shape, or figure, of objects in a <b>way</b> significantly different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> treats sensory perception through the other sense modalities, and even <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> treats the visual perception of color. This paper argues that the recent secondary literature is mistaken in this regard. I argue that Reid treats the visual perception of shape no differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> treats, say, the tactile perception of hardness...|$|R

5000|$|After his {{departure}} from Oxford Toland resided in London {{for most of}} the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on <b>the</b> Continent <b>from</b> 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica says of him that at his death in London at age 51 [...] "he died... as he had lived, in great poverty, in the midst of his books, with his pen in his hand." [...] Just before he died, he composed his own epitaph: [...] "He was an assertor of liberty, a lover of all sorts of learning ... but no man’s follower or dependent. Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> had chosen." ...|$|R

50|$|That Phaedo was {{friends with}} Plato seems likely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> is {{introduced}} in Plato's dialogue Phaedo which takes {{its name from}} him.
