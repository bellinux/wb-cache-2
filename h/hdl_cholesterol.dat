25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels. Thus by affecting the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.|$|E

25|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate lifestyle-induced hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin function (i.e., insulin resistance) as a decisive factor in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, {{which in turn}} is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microtrauma and clot formation (i.e., heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e., cancer). Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called metabolic syndrome) are characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity, elevated blood sugar, elevated blood pressure, elevated blood triglycerides, and reduced <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> The negative effect of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1/PGE2 balance may be significant.|$|E
25|$|Although estrogens {{influence}} the hepatic production of coagulant and fibrinolytic factors {{and increase the}} risk of VTE and sometimes stroke, they also {{influence the}} liver synthesis of blood lipids and can have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. With oral estradiol, there are increases in circulating triglycerides, <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein A2, and decreases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a). Transdermal estradiol has less-pronounced effects on these proteins and, in contrast to oral estradiol, reduces triglycerides. Through these effects, both oral and transdermal estrogens can protect against atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in menopausal women with intact arterial endothelium that is without severe lesions.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol is one {{of three}} major classes of lipids which all animal cells use to {{construct}} their membranes and is thus manufactured by all animal cells. Plant cells do not manufacture cholesterol. It is also the precursor of the steroid hormones and bile acids. Since cholesterol is insoluble in water, it is transported in the blood plasma within protein particles (lipoproteins). Lipoproteins are classified by their density: very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). All the lipoproteins carry cholesterol, but elevated levels of the lipoproteins other than HDL (termed non-HDL cholesterol), particularly LDL-cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In contrast, higher levels of <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> are protective.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{components}} of the cardiometabolic syndrome, only the prevalence of dyslipidemia has declined in the United States. Between 1999 and 2010, the percentage of U.S. adults with high total cholesterol declined from approximately 18% to 13%. However, according to the American Heart Association, nearly half of U.S. adults today (44%) are still at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease because their levels of total cholesterol are elevated (200mg/dL or higher). Of these 98.8 million individuals with elevated cholesterol, 33.6 million have high cholesterol (240mg/dL or above), and 71.3 million have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 130mg/dL or higher. In addition, approximately 19% of U.S. adults have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (<b>HDL)</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> and one-third have elevated triglycerides. Finally, dyslipidemia affects the vast majority (up to 97%) of individuals with diabetes and contributes to their elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress.

Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (<b>HDL)</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} into the risk factors that {{are more prone to}} Japanese Americans, {{specifically}} in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals {{of the study was to}} create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer’s disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based off a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased <b>HDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60nbsp&mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding “bad genes” denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.|$|E

40|$|Background. High density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) may be {{an important}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease in older people. HDL is heterogeneous with several subfractions. This article describes the distribution and correlates of <b>HDL</b> 2 <b>cholesterol</b> (C) and <b>HDL</b> 3 -C in older people. Methods. <b>HDL</b> subfraction <b>cholesterols</b> were measured in 1, 127 females and 825 males 3 = 65 years old who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Distributions of <b>HDL</b> subfraction <b>cholesterols</b> and bivariate and multivariate relationships were determined in cross-sectional analyses. Results. Mean (± SD) concentrations of HDL subfractions were: HDL 3 -C (M. 98 ±. 25, F 1. 2 ±. 29 mmol/ 1), HDL 2 -C (M. 09 ±. 08, F. 13 ±. 09 mmol/ 1). HDL 2 -C, but not HDL 3 -C, was slightly higher with age. Using multivariate analysis, both HDL 2 -C and HDL 3 -C (in females) were inversely correlated with triglyceride, body weight, and fasting insulin; HDL 3 - C was inversely correlated with central fat distribution in women. Both HDL 2 -C and HDL 3 -C were lower in participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease. However, only HDL 3 -C was significantly inversely related to carotid stenosis, as measured by ultrasound. Conclusions. The slight increase in HDL-C with age appears to be due to an increase in the HDL 2 -C subfraction. HDL-C subfractions are independently related to triglyceride levels, body weight, and insulin concentrations in older people, all potentially modifiable risk factors.
