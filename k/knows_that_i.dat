500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?"

500|$|The Rio Branco Cabinet, {{increasingly}} divided, {{resigned in}} June 1875 after having served for four years. The Cabinet's viability had been impaired by the ongoing crisis with the Catholic Church {{and an international}} financial crash that caused the failure of several Brazilian banks. The Emperor attempted, without success, to convince Paranhos to continue {{as head of the}} government. Paranhos replied in a letter: [...] "Your Majesty <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish to deliver my post to whoever is better to occupy it. If I have not become sick in public thus far, {{there is no doubt that}} I am tired." [...] PedroII had no intention on naming the 2nd Viscount of Uruguai as Rio Branco's replacement, to prevent the ultraconservative faction from coming to power. Instead, he called on the Duke of Caxias to head a new cabinet.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{says that}} he understands the {{difference}} between serving in elected office and serving as a minister, saying his job as lieutenant governor would be to serve and represent all Virginians regardless of their beliefs. He said, [...] "I have spiritual convictions that I preach in church, {{but that is not}} my role as lieutenant governor. Anybody who knows me <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe in the Christian principle of love for all people. ... That doesn't mean I'm going to say things that everybody agrees with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garrett and Carl Adamson rode together, heading from Las Cruces, New Mexico in Adamson's wagon. Brazel {{appeared}} on horseback along the way. Garrett {{was shot and}} killed, but exactly by whom remains the subject of controversy. Brazel and Adamson left the body {{by the side of}} the road and returned to Las Cruces, where Brazel surrendered to Deputy Sheriff Felipe Lucero. More than thirty years later, Lucero claimed that Brazel exclaimed, [...] "Lock me up. I've just killed Pat Garrett!" [...] Brazel then pointed to Adamson and said, [...] "He saw the whole thing and <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shot in self-defense." [...] Deputy Lucero incarcerated Brazel, summoned a coroner's jury, and rode to Pat Garrett's death site.|$|E

2500|$|Man Chong {{gathered}} his subordinates and told them, [...] "Sun Quan <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have moved the {{troops out of}} Hefei.

Although he doesn't have the courage to push further in and attack Xincheng, he'll definitely send his troops ashore just to show off how big his army is." [...] He then ordered 6,000 troops to lie in ambush in Hefei and wait for the Wu soldiers to come ashore. As Man Chong predicted, Sun Quan did order his troops to go ashore and put on a show of might. When that happened, the 6,000 troops in Hefei launched a sudden and fierce attack on them. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while some drowned as they tried to flee back to their ships.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, {{the release}} was {{followed}} by a headlining tour in the U.S. Due to a volcano eruption on Iceland, The Red Chord was forced to miss a co-headlining European [...] "Machines Of Grind" [...] tour with Aborted and Rotten Sound,, Blabbemouth.net who subsequently embarked on a [...] "DIY Fuck The Volcano" [...] tour without The Red Chord. The band later performed in Japan with Between the Buried and Me. Drummer Michael Justian rejoined the band in February 2010, shortly after Fickeisen departed. Fickeisen commented his departure: [...] "There is no easy way to go about leaving a busy band with plans in constant motion, but a little abruptly, I chose to depart from manning the kit for The Red Chord. I have had a great time {{for the past five years}} with these guys, and wouldn't exchange it for anything. Touring is tough; everyone who's done it <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> (...) <b>I</b> want to thank Greg, Guy, and Mike, and wish them the best of luck in the future." [...] A music video for [...] "Demoralizer", that was filmed in late 2009, was released in mid-February.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Larson {{accepted}} {{a position of}} assistant professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College in Erie, Pennsylvania. [...] At the time, Behrend College was a 2-year branch campus of the university. [...] In 1971, the Board of Trustees of the University met with the Behrend Advisory Board to announce Behrend College would become the first location outside University Park with the authority to develop baccalaureate program and confer degrees locally. During his first several years at the college, Larson was instrumental in developing a mathematics major at the college. [...] He served {{as a member of}} the University Faculty Senate and also as Behrend College's representative on the University Faculty Council. [...] Larson was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1983. Early in his career at Penn State, Larson started writing manuscripts for textbooks. He completed and submitted three manuscripts for calculus texts in 1973, 1974, and 1975 ... only to be rejected by several publishers. [...] Larson relates his determination to continue writing in an essay titled A Single Dream. [...] "When Marilyn Monroe was asked if she had been lucky in her career, she said 'When you have a single dream it is more than likely to come true---because you keep working toward it without getting mixed up.' Anyone who has been in my office <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a Marilyn fan. But not just a Marilyn fan---I am a fan of the American Dream." [...] Finally, in 1976 he and his co-author, Robert P. Hostetler, obtained a contract from D. C. Heath and Company. The first edition of their calculus book was published in December, 1978. [...] In 1995, Hostetler left the authorship team and was replaced by Bruce A. Edwards of the University of Florida. [...] Calculus by Larson and Edwards is now in its tenth edition. [...] It is used worldwide and has been translated in several languages.|$|E
