5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, he and {{his wife}} Annie became {{partners}} with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two Pacific Bio-diesel plants, one in Salem, Oregon, and the other at Carl's Corner, Texas (the Texas plant was founded by Carl Cornelius, a longtime Nelson friend and the namesake for Carl's Corner). In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel ("Bio-Willie"), a company that is marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops. The <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in diesel engines.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a {{fission product}} of uranium-235; therefore, each {{kilogram}} of fission product contains {{a significant amount}} of the lighter platinum group metals including rhodium. Used nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> a potential source of rhodium. However, the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.|$|E
30|$|At the Fescue site, {{fire was}} of {{moderate}} severity in the SEP treatment as juniper 1 -hr and 10 -hr <b>fuels</b> <b>were</b> fully consumed, 100 -hr <b>fuels</b> <b>were</b> partially consumed, and shrub mortality {{was less than}} 75 % (Appendix 3).

5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. <b>fuel)</b> <b>is</b> used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood <b>fuel</b> <b>is</b> consumed.|$|E
50|$|Cryogenic <b>fuels</b> <b>are</b> <b>fuels</b> {{that require}} storage at {{extremely}} low temperatures {{in order to}} maintain them in a liquid state. These <b>fuels</b> <b>are</b> used in machinery that operates in space (e.g. rocket ships and satellites) because ordinary <b>fuel</b> cannot <b>be</b> used there, due to absence of an environment that supports combustion (on earth, oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere, whereas in human-explorable space, oxygen is virtually non-existent). Cryogenic fuels most often constitute liquefied gases such as liquid hydrogen.|$|R
