5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had raised <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman {{had said he}} was dead, {{and that there was}} no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Carl's mother Nora White is {{introduced}} {{for a single}} episode, played by Lynn Farleigh, when he and Kirsty visit her in a nursing home. Inside Soap said that Nora is [...] "pure, unbridled evil" [...] and her introduction might show why Carl is a menace, giving viewers a [...] "glimpse into [...] twisted upbringing". They said there is tension between Carl and Nora, and compared her digging her fingernails into <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> burning of Ian's hand, asking [...] "has Carl learnt everything he knows from his evil mum?" [...] Jim Shelley thought that Nora's introduction [...] "seemed to {{be the start of}} a campaign trying to garner some sympathy for Carl—henceforth, a nasty, charmless bully". Coonan said that Nora is [...] "dominating and horrible" [...] and shows that Carl has [...] "demons within his own family" [...] and a [...] "troubled background".|$|E
6000|$|He raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead--his silk hat was on {{the table}} rim upwards; he had put it there with a despairing gesture as he came in--he raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead. [...] "It seems to me unfair. I--" [...] He broke off again. Anthony looked at Flora who stood by the side of her father.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mouth forthwith, and {{uttered a}} {{peculiar}} cry.|$|R

2500|$|El Greco {{regarded}} {{color as}} the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting ("I hold the imitation of color to be the greatest difficulty of art."—Notes of the painter in one of his commentaries). He declared that color had primacy over drawing; thus his opinion on Michelangelo was that [...] "he was a good man, but {{he did not know how}} to paint". Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, was startled by the painter's technique: [...] "If I say that Domenico Greco sets <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> canvases many and many times over, that he worked upon them again and again, but to leave the colors crude and unblent in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity?" [...] Pacheco asserts that [...] "El Greco believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".|$|E
2500|$|However, Nemțeanu {{has also}} {{gathered}} favorable notice, in particular for his [...] "poems in pencil, capturing the pathos {{of everyday life}} and of the tiny bourgeois provinces". In 1919, publicist Constantin V. Gerota confessed: [...] "I had rarely seen such sincerity and so little gravitas, such little affectation [...] Nemțeanu was a jester in his poetry. He did not spend hour upon hour with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> temple, only to produce the same as what others have said before him." [...] A [...] "delicate, affable, intimate poet", he [...] "had no great concept of life", but rather focused on [...] "sentimental attitudes". Contrarily, Albert Honigman, the reviewer at Universul Literar, saw Nemțeanu as a Romanian Heine, who, beyond a [...] "note of sentiment" [...] and a [...] "delicacy of expression", poured conscious thought into his poetry. Dragomirescu suggests the same, also noting that, had he lived to produce more works, Nemțeanu could have entered a [...] "realm of the great poetry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sylvan Barnet {{believes}} {{that in this}} adaptation, [...] "Kate and Petruchio fall in love {{almost as soon as}} they see each other." [...] Barbara Hodgdon has also pointed out that several times, Katherina can be seen gazing longingly at Petruchio. Critics have also noted that Katherina twice consciously makes the decision to go along with Petruchio. The first moment is behind the stained glass window, when she silently decides to marry him. The second is when she follows him after he leaves her at the gates of Padua. In this version, Katherina delivers her final speech seemingly without irony. Zeffirelli and Burton both wanted Elizabeth Taylor to deliver the speech ironically, a la Mary Pickford, but Taylor felt {{it would be better to}} speak seriously, and then undermine that seriousness by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, thus subverting his apparent authority over her. However, Elizabeth Schafer calls the film [...] "intensely conservative," [...] citing the controversial advertising blurb; [...] "A motion picture for every man who ever gave the back of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> beloved...and for every woman who deserved it. Which takes in a lot of people! Russell Jackson argues the film [...] "offers a 1960s liberation more likely to appeal to Lawrentians than present-day feminists." [...] However, Schafer does go on to acknowledge that [...] "because of the sheer power of Taylor's presence, Katherina occupies a far more memorable filmic space than the dramatic space she has in the original play.|$|E

2500|$|Mehserle stood up, unholstered his gun, a SIG Sauer P226, {{and fired}} a shot into Grant's back. Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle {{appeared}} surprised and raised <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face; according <b>to</b> Michael Rains, Mehserle's criminal defense attorney, several eyewitnesses described Mehserle as looking stunned.
