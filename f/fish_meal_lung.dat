The chicks were fasted for 48 hr before being fed the experimental diets and were injected with estradiol three times during the experiment. After 4 days, hepatic lipid content was determined. In the first experiment, the quantity of hepatic lipid deposited per unit of liver and per 100 g body weight was significantly less for chicks fed 10 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and an ethanol ex-tract of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> equivalent to 10 % than for chicks fed an unsupplemented corn-soy diet. In a second experiment a significant reduction in hepatic lipids deposited per 100 g body weight was observed with 10 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> but only a numerical reduction with ethanol extracts of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> equivalent to 10 or 20 % and the ash of ethanol extract equivalent to 20 %.

Overexploitation of fisheries resources and the high growth rate of aquaculture industry, however, continues {{to put pressure on}} the supply of <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> thus increasing the demand and price of this sought-after product. The use of alternative ingredients to <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> therefore, remains a high priority for aquaculture nutrition. Hence, the aim of this was to investigate the physiological and developmental effects on juvenile spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii, after supplementing <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> with different feed additives for 12 weeks. One of the additives was then selected for further feeding at graded levels (increasing levels) for 8 weeks to ascertain whether <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> could be replaced by higher amounts of the feed additive without negative consequences to the cultured spotted grunter...|$|R
40|$|Silver belly (Leiognathus Spp.) forms a major {{fishery in}} recent years in the Rameswaram island but fetches for the {{fishermen}} very low prices ranging from Rs. 0. 03 to 0. 12 /Kg only, there being practically no demand for the fish. The possibilities of utilizing this cheap fish are discussed and the processing method described. During the glut season the cost of production of Silver belly <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> works out to competitive prices of Rs. 500 to 700 /ton. The silver belly <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> is of high quality with good protein content averaging 57. 71 % in commercial samples and 61. 90 % in laboratory samples and with a high pepsin digestibility of 90. 0 % to 92. 5 %. The essential amino acid composition of the Silver belly <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> compares very favorably with other round <b>fish</b> <b>meals,</b> with high contents of lysine, leucine, arginine, isoleucine, methionine, phenyl alanine, threonine and valine. Since there is good demand for <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> as poultry and cattle food both in the internal and external markets, there is good scope for large scale production and sale of <b>fish</b> <b>meal...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} fish catch {{production and}} estimated demand of aquafeed, <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> <b>fish</b> oil, soybean <b>meal</b> in Viet Nam for year 2013. Fish catch production was around 2. 8 {{million metric tons}} (mt) while marine fish production was 1. 9 million mt. Estimated marine trash fish production was 0. 8 million mt with over 100 species including the dominant species anchovy (Stolephorus spp.), lizard fish (Saurida spp.) and pony fish (Leistognathus spp.). Approximately 0. 5 million mt of marine trash fish was used for livestock, aquaculture and <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> Local marine <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> consisting of protein content from 50 to 68 % and catfish byproduct meal containing protein level from 50 to 60 % were available. Based on FCR values of 5 major species including catfish, black tiger shrimp, white leg shrimp, Asian seabass, and snake head, aquafeed production was estimated at around 2. 5 million mt. Marine fish oil/squid liver oil requirement was from 15. 5 to 31 thousand mt. <b>Fish</b> <b>meal</b> demand was from 252 and 430 thousand mt. Almost all <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and marine <b>fish</b> oil used in aquafeed were imported. Moreover, soybean and other plant ingredients are potential alternative sources to replace <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and <b>fish</b> oil. Vietnamese farmers produced 168 thousand mt soybean while soybean demand amounts for aquafeed were from 693 to 1, 140 thousand mt. In 2013, feedmills imported approximately 3 million mt of soybean meal (cake) from many countries in the world. Some other plant protein sources which were also imported, have good nutrient profiles but they contain some anti-nutritional factors. In the future, research on replacement of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and <b>fish</b> oil with plant and animal by-product sources and feed additives for aquafeed should be studied. In particular, the management of local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> plants and capture fishery should be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary {{ingredients}} such as <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> rock phosphate and roxarsone on {{the accumulation of}} arsenic residues in breast meat, liver and heart was examined in Arbor Acre broilers from days 1 - 43 of age. Broilers receiving diets containing <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> had a significantly greater amount of arsenic in breast muscle than other groups. There was {{a positive correlation between}} muscular arsenic concentration and dietary <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> levels. Withdrawal of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> for a week prior to slaughter reduced the muscular deposition of arsenic. Chicks receiving roxarsone had significantly higher arsenic level in the liver compared to other groups and arsenic levels decreased after withdraw. Neither calcium sources such as rock phosphate nor arsenic-containing growth promoters affected the deposition of arsenic residue in meat. In conclusion, <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was the major factor resulting in the arsenic contamination of breast meat in broilers.

Premium grade <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> (72 %protein) {{was divided into}} two portions, with and without ethoxyquin, each portion was then stored at either ambient temperature or 4 oC for 0, 1. 5, 3 and 4. 5 months. The results showed no interaction between 3 factors (supplemented with or without ethoxyquin, at 27 - 32 oC and 4 o and storage time) on protein, lipid and ash of <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> Peroxide value (PV) and anisidine value (AnV) increased with storage time with the highestvalue in the non-ethoxyquin sample stored at ambient temperature for 4. 5 months. An increase of TBARS was found in non-ethoxyquin <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> stored at both ambient temperature and 4 oC with the highest valuein the sample stored at 4 oC for 4. 5 months. Storage conditions without ventilation/air circulation caused an accumulation of malonaldehyde in the <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> storage at 4 oC for a long period.

40|$|This {{trial was}} {{conducted}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that early lactation cows grazing ryegrass pasture and receiving maize and mineral supplementation could respond to additional supplementation with a protein source such as <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> Multiparous Jersey cows in early to mid lactation that grazed annual ryegrass pasture in spring were used in a randomised complete block design experiment. In addition to the pasture, cows received 6 kg (as is) of a maize-based supplement, including minerals, fed in two equal portions in the milking parlour. Three groups of 15 cows received a control, a low <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> or a high <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> treatment (0, 4 or 8 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> replacing maize). Milk yield was measured and milk samples taken fortnightly. A simultaneous study on rumen fermentation was conducted using eight rumen cannulated cows receiving the control and high <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> treatments in a cross-over design experiment. Ruminal pH and ammonia-N and volatile fatty acid concentrations were measured. Milk yield, 4 % fat-corrected milk yield and milk fat and protein percentages of cows on the low and high <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> treatments (21. 9 and 22. 1 kg milk/d, 24. 1 and 24. 2 kg 4 % fat corrected milk/d, 4. 73 and 4. 67 % fat and 3. 49 and 3. 45 % protein) were higher than the control (20. 5 kg milk/d, 20. 4 kg 4 % fat corrected milk/d, 3. 97 % fat and 3. 25 % protein).
