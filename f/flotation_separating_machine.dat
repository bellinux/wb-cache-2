25|$|The {{extracted}} ore {{is treated}} at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is {{run through a}} concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder. <b>Flotation</b> then <b>separates</b> the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which float off as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective <b>flotation</b> step <b>separates</b> the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.|$|R
40|$|Statecharts are a tool {{to model}} the {{reactive}} behavior of an object or system. Statecharts can be extended to execute on <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> and coordinate {{with each other to}} achieve complex reactive behavior. We propose using a framework of classes to take statechart diagrams and make them executable on <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> to handle pervasive computing concerns...|$|R
50|$|One {{rationale}} {{for the production of}} these machines is space saving. A combination machine takes up much less space than the equivalent <b>separate</b> <b>machines.</b> Most European machines have a sliding table that tends to make them safer than typical North American table saws. Even though top end combination machines can be quite expensive, there usually is a cost saving over <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> of similar quality.|$|R
40|$|The {{reciprocal}} motions at the vibrational <b>separating</b> <b>machines</b> of the sieving trunks, {{transmitted from}} the actuating mechanism, vibrate frame. The Frame weaving is put over the sieving trunks weaving, disturbing the optimal mode of operation. Therefore, for the bearing structures of <b>separating</b> <b>machines</b> vibration decrease {{it is necessary}} to optimize its structures and characteristics of the actuating mechanism, which would provide the minimal mass with the necessarily frame rigidity...|$|R

25|$|In 1932 he was {{transferred}} to the Far East to become an assistant machine gun company commander in the 99th <b>Separate</b> <b>Machine</b> Gun Battalion of the Blagoveshchensk Fortified Area, part of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army. In 1934, Arapov became assistant {{chief of staff of the}} 77th <b>Separate</b> <b>Machine</b> Gun Battalion of the Grodekovo Fortified Area. He subsequently served as battalion chief of staff and then as commander of its training company.|$|R
50|$|Some washer dryer {{combination}} {{units are}} Energy Star certified, {{which means that}} they meet a minimum standard for energy efficiency. Some of these washers are also rated well for their water consumption. However, overall environmental and financial impact of any given installation must be calculated not only from the instantaneous energy and water consumption rates, but also the time it must be run per load. A combo machine with smaller capacity than <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> may have to be run more than once for an amount of laundry that larger machines might handle in one pass, and in doing so could potentially use more energy or water per load than larger, <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> even if it does have a lower rated power consumption. Conversely, <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> may be less efficient overall if their capacity is larger than necessary for the loads they will be required to handle.|$|R

5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth <b>flotation</b> <b>separates</b> mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|R

30|$|Different cloud clients may request {{different}} {{amounts of}} VM resources {{which may be}} assigned on the same PM and not on <b>separate</b> <b>machines.</b> Therefore, it is both impractical and too difficult to predict the demand {{for each type of}} resource separately.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} hybrid systems that include an {{electronic}} ballot marking device (usually a touch screen system {{similar to a}} DRE) or other assistive technology to print a voter verified paper audit trail, then use a <b>separate</b> <b>machine</b> for electronic tabulation.|$|R
50|$|Swingnose {{crossings}} need {{to operate}} {{at the same time}} as the main turnout switches to which they belong. This may require excessive effort for manual operation, and require a point motor. The main turnout and the swingnose crossing will require <b>separate</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{concurrent}} systems, particularly distributed systems, when a {{group of}} processes must interact in order to progress, if the processes are scheduled at separate times or on <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> (fragmented across time or machines), the time spent waiting for each other or in communicating with each other can severely degrade performance. Instead, performant systems require coscheduling of the group.|$|R
50|$|This exhibit {{depicts the}} area’s early {{agricultural}} history and includes farming implements, tools, and engines of many types. These numerous artifacts represent {{the methods of}} our agriculture in its early years. Items of interest: Dairy display donated in 2007 by Bob McDowell, includes a cream <b>separating</b> <b>machine,</b> numerous milk bottles, and other items related to the dairy business.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Multi-Max Press (which was also made {{entirely out of}} steel plate). The ingenious Verson designed this innovative machine, which would perform almost any operation on sheet metal (e.g., shearing, notching, punching, bending and forming). [...] These processes would have normally required three <b>separate</b> <b>machine</b> tools (a shear, a press brake and a press).|$|R
40|$|Economic realities make {{flexibility}} in production processes a necessity. Small batch production necessitates reuse of machines within different production processes. Monitoring in such production environments must adapt to process changes without impacting production machines and software. In this work we propose a novel method for production monitoring using event processing networks, <b>separating</b> <b>machine</b> and production processes, thus increasing flexibility and minimizing configuration efforts...|$|R
50|$|The GKD, {{like the}} PND and SWD, is {{available}} to information systems in libraries (usually library networks) and other areas via the DDB file on a standard CD-ROM or through a Z39.50 interface - but usually only for a fee. For access to authority records, there is a <b>separate</b> <b>Machine</b> Exchange Format for Libraries or MAB GKD. Previously microfiches were used (see illustration).|$|R
50|$|The Haystack project {{outlines}} a three-tiered architecture, {{which allows}} the persistent store, the Haystack data model itself, and the clients that access it to reside on <b>separate</b> <b>machines.</b> The interface to the middle tier is flexible enough {{that a number of}} different persistent storage models can be used, including relational databases, semistructured databases, and object-oriented databases. Presto's architecture exhibits similar features.|$|R
50|$|Multiboxing {{refers to}} playing as {{multiple}} separate characters concurrently in an MMORPGs. This {{can either be}} achieved by using multiple <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> to run the game or by running multiple separate instances of the game. Multiboxing might be considered a form of cheating. Multiboxing {{is considered to be}} difficult to do well without practice, as it involves adapting to problems in real-time.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two basic}} molding methods for PET bottles, {{one-step}} and two-step. In two-step molding, two <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.|$|R
30|$|The {{capability}} {{to connect the}} communication path between modules allows the end-to-end pipeline to be constructed and described seamlessly. This is done through a proxy communication layer allowing the modules to run either closely together or on completely <b>separate</b> <b>machines.</b> This strategy is transparent to the beamline user and accommodates both environments with centralized resources {{as well as those}} where resources are spread across a network.|$|R
50|$|Every product can {{be defined}} by its market niche. The niche market is highly specialized, and aiming to survive among the {{competition}} from numerous super companies. Even established companies create products for different niches, for example, Hewlett-Packard has all-in-one machines for printing, scanning and faxing targeted for the home office niche {{while at the same}} time having <b>separate</b> <b>machines</b> with one of these functions for big businesses.|$|R
