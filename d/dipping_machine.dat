40|$|In general, organic grown apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.) are {{not treated}} with {{chemical}} fungicides to prevent storage decay and these fruits may suffer up to 30 % decay during storage. Preliminary experiments {{had shown that}} hot water dipping of apples may be an alternative. To inhibit Gloeosporium rot (Pezicula alba, P. malicortis) water temperature may be of about 50 °C and dipping time from 60 sec up to 180 sec. The present investigation was conducted to test different ranges of temperatures and dipping time periods in different apple cultivars over a three year investigation. The objective was to determinate the suitable hot water treatment that prevents decay incidence and maintains fruit quality (firmness, scale symptoms). For the reduction of post harvest decay the treatment 53 °C and 180 sec is recommended; that was found suitable for `Topaz`. For cultivars with a sensitivity to skin disorders dips for 120 sec or 180 sec are recommended; that was found best for ´Elstar´(51 °C), ´Ingrid Marie` (49 °C), ´Holsteiner Cox´(51 °C) und ´Boskoop´(51 °C).

To get the full text please contact the other at Ibtisammohamed@hotmail. comThis study showed current dairy management and husbandry practices in 60 dairy farms at different preurban areas of Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman of Khartoum State (20 farms from each town). Information about dairy management was collected by questionnaire and direct interview with farms' owners. The results indicated that there were significant differences in education levels of dairy farms' owners. Khartoum dairy farms' owners' exhibit higher illiteracy level (35 %), Khartoum North (I 5 %) and Omdurman (30 %). Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were obtained in herd size and herd structure. Moreover, dairy herd numbers were 170. 25 ± 72. 83, 123. 10 ± 105. 71 and 92. 35 ± 29. 23 in Khartoum North, Khartoum and Omdurman, respectively. Breed type revealed non-significant differences between the three cities. However, 92 % of the cattle in the studied farms were grade cattle and mainly they were of unknown foreign blood percentages. Ideal building materials, health set up, design and different management practices rarely practiced in preurban dairy farms at Khartoum State and they were only restricted to 9 farms (45 %) in Khartoum and 6 farms (30 %) in Khartoum North. Corrugated iron roof, concrete flour, strip cup dip and teat <b>dipping,</b> <b>machine</b> milking and mastitis prevention practices were reported to be very rare. Concerning the health services and preventive measures, the diseases control were not satisfactory, only 10 % of the studied dairy farms had resident veterinarian. Vaccinations against diseases were rarely used in regular way. General hygiene and sanitation measures such as dung removal, disinfection, cleaning program and maintaining minimal contamination during milking process could not be observed in the majority of dairy farms studied. Also disposal of abnormal milk were applied directly in the pens in 83 % of the farms. Moreover, testing, isolation and culling practices were not common. The highest numbers of aborted cows at late pregnancy were showed in 1 - 16 dairy farms in Khartoum. Similarly mastitis, which was found in 14 farms, in Khartoum and the cases ranged from 1 - 5 cases. The present study concluded that the majority of farms were poorly constructed and they are with limited management skills [...] This might create health risk and environmental contaminations. Hence provision of essential services and extension services among dairy farmers, labours and milkers were urgently needed on dairy faming practices such as housing, milking techniques and hygiene, proper sanitary practices and cleaning programs, diseases prevention measures and culling strategy...|$|E

This project is focused on the fabrication and characterization of a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coating with and without a calcium phosphate (CaP) barrier layer capable of multiple growth factor delivery. The PEM coatings are created using a layer-by-layer (LBL) process in a <b>dip</b> coating <b>machine</b> in order to create uniform layers of oppositely charged material that can be used to deliver embedded growth factors. A custom sample holder was designed and fabricated using 3 -D printing in order to minimize use of the expensive reagents. Diffusion and mixture of multiple growth factors through PEM-only coatings motivated the introduction of a CaP barrier layer. The CaP layer is precipitated using the simulated body fluid technique over the first growth factor followed by the PEM coating and additional growth factors. Confocal imaging of fluorescent model proteins was investigated as a means to assess the effectiveness of the CaP barrier layer in blocking diffusion of the model protein through poly L lysine/poly L Glutamic acid PEM coatings. Unfortunately, confocal imaging doesn’t have the resolution to discriminate the fluorescent model protein location within these nanometer thick PEM coatings, and the rough surface of the CaP further complicated the analysis. Cell-based bioassays are recommended to study ability of CaP to block diffusion of embedded factors within PEM coatings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{electric}} tracing of the load variation of an induction machine supplied by the mains. A load trouble, like a torque <b>dip,</b> affects the <b>machine</b> supply current and consequently {{it should be possible}} to use the current pattern to detect features of the torque pattern, using the machine itself as a torque sensor. But current signature depends on many phenomena and misunderstandings are possible. At first the effect of different load anomalies on current spectrum, in comparison with other machine troubles like rotor asymmetries, are investigated. Reference is made to low frequency torque disturbances, which cause a quasistationary machine behavior. Simplified relationships, validated by simulation results and by experimental results, are developed to address the current spectrum features. In order to detect on-lines anomalies, a current signature extraction is performed by the time-frequency spectrum approach. This method allows the detection of random fault as well. Finally it is shown that a Neural Network approach can help the torque pattern recognition, improving the interpretation of machine anomalies effects...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Large {{synchronous}} {{machines are}} frequently utilised in industry and have several advantages and disadvantages. Although a synchronous motor {{is more efficient}} than an induction motor, it is also far more complex and sensitive in terms of starting and voltage dips respectively. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} impact and sensitivities of a synchronous motor. The impact that a large synchronous motor has on a power system network can be significant. The impact of the quality of supply of the power system on a large synchronous motor can also impact negatively on the operational availability of the motor and should be well understood. A synchronous motor will be installed in a production facility and as such, this investigation {{is in the form of}} a case study. This document entails the detailed study, modelling and simulation of the impact of a large low-speed synchronous motor on a power system network, as well as the impact of the power system network on the motor (in terms of voltage <b>dips).</b> Detailed <b>machine</b> and system parameters were gathered from the motor supplier and utility. The effect that the motor has on the network and the effect of the network on the motor were analysed with detailed actual system and motor data. These analyses included load flows, short circuits, motor starting and a transient stability. A comparison of the supplier-suggested stability limits was made with the outcome of an undervoltage stability study. The study revealed that the supplier was over-pessimistic about the voltage dip ride-through capability. Graph 3. 28 : Voltage dip scatter plot indicating different tripping areas indicates a significant improvement from what was initially offered by the supplier. The dip ride-through capability was increased almost threefold after the interaction of the motor with the power system was studied in detail. This increased dip ride-through capability will have a significant impact on the plant performance. This however must be achieved without any damage to the motor or the associated equipment of this machine. Proper control with a thorough understanding of the synchronous motor's behaviour will lead to an increase in the machine's operational availability (on-line time for a continuous process) Master...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a low-cost, centimeter-scale kinematic coupling fixture {{for use in}} nanomanufacturing equipment. The fixture uses magnetic circuit design techniques to optimize the magnetic preload required to achieve repeatability {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers. The fixture achieves accuracy to within one micrometer via an adjustable interface composed of UV curing adhesive between the mating kinematic coupling components. The fixture is monitored by a micro-vision system and moved by a six-axis nanopositioner until proper alignment is achieved, at which point the fixture position is permanently set by UV light. This thesis presents design rules and insights for design of a general accurate and repeatable kinematic fixture and presents a case study of fixtures used for tool exchange on <b>dip</b> pen nanolithography <b>machines.</b> A prototype fixturing assembly was fabricated and tested for repeatability and stability in six degrees of freedom. The test results concluded that the fixture has a 1 -o- 3 -D translational repeatability of 87 nanometers and a 3 -D stability of 344 nanometers over 48 hours. This is an order of magnitude improvement on past low-cost accurate and repeatable fixture designs. This optimized accurate and repeatable kinematic fixture will enable repeatable, accurate, quick, and elegant tool change, thus advancing the manufacturing capabilities of nanofabrication techniques. by Adrienne Watral.

40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{analyzes}} the dynamic response of wind power generators {{in case of}} voltage dips. When a fault occurs in the network, a voltage dip {{is applied to the}} wind power generator common coupling point. Wind power generators are equipped with minimum voltage protections that can trip the unit in case of a long voltage dip to protect both the machine and the power system. If wind power generators are connected to the transmission network, a fault in it may result in voltage dip applied to many wind power generators. A large amount of wind power generation can be tripped if the dip is long enough, leading to system collapse. The capability of wind power generators to withstand voltage dips is a key feature of them since it is currently determining the maximum admissible wind power generation in systems with high wind penetration. The response of wind power generators to voltage dips depends on the technology of the electromechanical energy conversion device. Three technologies are mainly used and will be analyzed and compared in this paper: squirrel cage induction generators, doubly fed induction generators and multi-pole synchronous generators. The fundamental response of the generators will be obtained {{as the basis for the}} design of protection schemes. Despite their limitations, wind power generators based on squirrel cage induction machines are widely used. A voltage dip results in a reduction of the electromagnetic torque and in a subsequent rotor acceleration. Depending on the voltage <b>dip</b> duration the <b>machine</b> may either come back to the original operating point or lose stability. During the fault and the deceleration process the machines consumes reactive current that it is limited by the transient reactance and the equivalent external impedance. Doubly fed induction generators are the most widespread electromechanical energy conversion devices in wind power generation due their speed regulating capability that allows them to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. In addition, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of doubly fed induction generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link and the overcurrents in the rotor converter. In addition, the doubly fed induction machine only consumes reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages and rotor converter currents can be reduced with a crowbar system connected to the machine rotor. Wind power generators based on multi-pole synchronous generators have the advantage that do not require a gear box. Multi-pole synchronous generators equipped with voltage source power electronic converters have speed regulating capability to be able to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. As in doubly fed induction generator, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of multipolesynchronous generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link. In addition, multipole synchronous generators do not draw reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages can be reduced connecting a crowbar system in the dc link. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
