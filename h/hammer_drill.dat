25|$|The {{origin of}} the first <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> {{is a matter of}} contention.|$|E
25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin silex, or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E
2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. [...] <b>Hammer</b> <b>drill</b> bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|E
50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling</b> with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide {{back and forth like a}} piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The <b>hammer</b> of the <b>drill</b> acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling</b> with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|R
25|$|Rotary <b>hammer</b> <b>drills</b> have an {{oil filled}} gearbox, which {{allows them to}} operate durably despite the large forces and shocks they receive and the grit-filled environments where they are often used.|$|R

2500|$|Hammer drills {{almost always}} have a lever or switch that locks off the special [...] "hammer clutch," [...] turning the tool into a {{conventional}} drill for wood or metal work. Hammer drills are more expensive and more bulky than regular drills, but are preferable for applications where the material to be drilledconcrete block or wood studsis unknown. [...] For example, an electrician would use a <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> for attaching items (such as an electrical box) to either wood studs (if used as a conventional power drill) or masonry walls (if used as a <b>hammer</b> <b>drill).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The US-american company Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation {{states that}} in 1935, it was selling a {{lightweight}} 1/4-inch electric <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> (cam-action).

2500|$|A <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|E
40|$|Drilling holes into {{concrete}} {{with heavy}} <b>hammer</b> and rock <b>drills</b> {{is one of}} the most physically demanding tasks performed in commercial construction and poses risks for musculoskeletal disorders, noise induced hearing loss, hand arm vibration syndrome and silicosis. The aim of this study was to (1) use a participatory process to develop a rig to support pneumatic rock drills or large electric <b>hammer</b> <b>drills</b> in order to reduce the health risks and (2) evaluate the usability of the rig. Seven prototype rigs for supporting large <b>hammer</b> <b>drills</b> were developed and modified with feedback from commercial contractors and construction workers. The final design was evaluated by laborers and electricians (N= 29) who performed their usual concrete drilling with the usual method and the new rig. Subjective regional fatigue was significantly less in the neck, shoulders, hands and arms, and lower back) when using the universal rig compared to the usual manual method. Usability ratings for the rig were significantly better than the usual method on stability, control, drilling, accuracy, and vibration. Drilling time was reduced by approximately 50 % with the rig. Commercial construction contractors, laborers and electricians who use large <b>hammer</b> <b>drills</b> for drilling many holes should consider using such a rig to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, fatigue, and silicosis.

2500|$|A <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "rotary hammer", [...] "roto-drill" [...] or [...] "{{hammering}} drill", (see also rotary drill) is a rotary drill with a hammering action. [...] The hammering action provides a short, rapid hammer thrust to pulverize relatively brittle material and provide quicker drilling with less effort. [...] These tools are usually electrically powered, and increasingly powered by batteries. [...] The same technology is also used in electric [...] "demolition hammers", {{also known as}} [...] "chipping guns" [...] or [...] "breakers".|$|E
2500|$|This drill {{team was}} the first to reach the trapped miners with an escape shaft. Plan B {{involved}} a Schramm Inc. T130XD air core drill owned by Geotec S.A. (a Chilean-American joint venture drilling company) that was chosen by Drillers Supply SA (the general contractor of Plan B) to widen one of the three 5.5inches (14cm) boreholes that were already keeping the miners supplied with palomas. Normally, the drills are used to drill top holes for {{the oil and gas industry}} and for mineral exploration and water wells. This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr, Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 7" [...] drill pipe air core drill, a team of American drillers from Layne Christensen Company and specialized Down-The-Hole drilling hammers from Center Rock, Inc., of Berlin, Pennsylvania. Center Rock's president and personnel from DSI Chile were present on-site for the 33 days of drilling. While the Schramm rig, built by privately held Schramm, Inc. of West Chester, Pennsylvania, was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by United Parcel Service.

5000|$|The first {{successful}} drills were the piston type, or [...] "reciprocators." [...] The drill steel piston and chuck moved together and reciprocated. In Leyner's <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> the steel was held loosely in a chuck {{attached to the}} cylinder itself, while the piston inside the cylinder reciprocated, striking blows on the blunt end of the drill steel. The <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> was lighter, speedier, and used less air than the reciprocating drill.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cam-type <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> a rotary/pneumatic <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They {{can also be used}} as [...] "drill only" [...] or as [...] "hammer only" [...] which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a rotary <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is fracture, {{wear and}} abscission of bit tooth {{that make up}} of the main failure forms for the air hammer bit, which have badly {{restricted}} the further popularization and application of the air <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling.</b> The main {{reason is that the}} ordinary cemented carbide tooth is difficult to meet the complex conditions of the air the <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling.</b> Therefore, this research puts forward a new thought that we strengthen the carbide tooth by adding the nano-Al 2 O 3 into the substrate materials of WC-Co. According to the study of several formulas of nano-composites, the test of sample performance, experimental study of impact abrasive wear and microstructure, we draw some conclusions that adding amount of nano-Al 2 O 3 can refine grain, make microstructure more uniform and improve the wear resistance of composites, but also can enhance the strength of boundaries of WC-Co and transform the fracture form from the intergranular fracture to the transgranular fracture. Meanwhile, it can also improve nano-composites comprehensive performance by adding rare earth. The result for site test of bit shows that comparing with the bit equipped the original carbide teeth, the efficiency of rock breaking of the bit equipped nano-composites teeth increase by 20 % and the service life increase by 80 %...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Hammer</b> <b>drills</b> of both working {{principles}} are {{well suited for}} drilling holes in masonry or stone.

50|$|Current {{estimates}} put {{the beginning}} of the San Luis Rey Complex at around AD 500-1000. The primary traits that distinguish this complex from the locally preceding San Dieguito, La Jolla, and Pauma complexes are the presence of small projectile points (indicative of use of the bow and arrow), pottery, and the practice of cremation. Other San Luis Rey Complex lithic tools include mortars and metates (both bedrock and portable), pestles and manos, flaked edge tools (scrapers and knives), <b>hammers,</b> <b>drills,</b> steatite arrow straighteners, pendants, beads, and quartz crystals. Shell ornaments and bone tools are also present. Red and black geometrical pictographs were painted.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there is}} a big {{difference}} in cost. In the UK a cam hammer typically costs £12 or more, while a rotary/pneumatic costs £35 or more. In the US a typical <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> costs between $70 and $120, and a rotary hammer between $150 and $500 (depending on bit size). For DIY use or to drill holes less than 13 mm (1/2 inch) in size, the <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> is most commonly used.|$|E
