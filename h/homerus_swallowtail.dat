50|$|Papilio homerus, the <b>Homerus</b> <b>{{swallowtail}}</b> or Jamaican giant swallowtail, is {{the largest}} swallowtail butterfly in the Western Hemisphere and the largest species in the genus Papilio with an average wingspan of about 15 cm (the African giant swallowtail has a larger wingspan, but this is mainly due to its elongated forewings). The <b>Homerus</b> <b>swallowtail</b> belongs to the swallowtail family (tribe: Papilionini) and is often placed in the subgenus Pterourus, considered a full genus by some authors.|$|E

50|$|The {{mountains}} {{are home to}} the world's second-largest butterfly and {{the largest in the}} Americas, the <b>Homerus</b> <b>swallowtail</b> (Papilio homerus). The Jamaican Coney (Geocapromys brownii), a type of rodent, and the Jamaican boa (Epicrates subflavus) are also found there.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} only in forests in Jamaica and is under {{significant}} pressure from habitat loss and potentially also from collecting. It {{has also been shown}} that death rates due to parasitic wasps of the genus Chrysonotomyia are higher in disturbed habitats. The <b>Homerus</b> <b>swallowtail</b> was relatively common in the 1930s and its range used to be contiguous, but it has now retracted to a main population in the Blue and John Crow Mountains in eastern Jamaica, and a tiny population, estimated at less than 50 adults, in Cockpit Country in the west of the island. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN and is included on Appendix I of CITES, thereby making international trade illegal. In addition to better protection of the remaining populations and their habitat, {{it has been suggested that}} a captive breeding program may help save the species. The caterpillars feed exclusively on Hernandia jamaicensis and H. catalpifolia; both of which also are endemic to Jamaica.|$|E
