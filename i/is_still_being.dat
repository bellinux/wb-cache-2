It is currently produced as a paid-for newspaper produced by the KM Group, based in nearby Whitstable. This newspaper covers the East Kent area and has a circulation of about 25,000.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{isotopes}} {{are inevitably}} present in {{spent nuclear fuel}} with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the 245Cm–248Cm isotopes have decay times {{of thousands of years}} and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal. The associated procedure involves several steps, where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> developed for curium.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his {{remains were}} {{examined}} by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, {{and that there was}} no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of sabotage, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the previously announced alignment of the Thomson-East Coast Line, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying whether to extend the TEL from Sungei Bedok station to the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and then connecting to the existing Changi Airport MRT station on the East-West Line. With such an extension, {{there will be a}} direct connection between Changi Airport and the city. Its length <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> decided.

5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> investigated for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The present era is {{classified}} {{as part of a}} mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100years. The extent of the current extinction event <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, but it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} late February 2006, Jason McElwain {{and his family}} started {{receiving}} inquiries from over twenty-five film companies, including The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros., about making a film based on his story. In April 2006, {{it was announced that}} Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to produce the film. Laura Ziskin, producer of the Spider-Man film series, was signed on to produce the film about McElwain's life. Magic Johnson has also been attached as producer, while two-time Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent is in talks to write the film. However, there currently is no timetable for the movie as contracts are being finalized and the script <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> written.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{continued}} to fade as it receded, but <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 {{years after the}} perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> investigated.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 500 speakers in the Southern Basque Country in Spain, approximately 2% {{of a population}} of 21,000 Romanis, and another estimated 500 in France. In Spain the remaining fluent speakers are elderly people mostly {{over the age of}} 80; some are equally fluent in Spanish, Basque, or Caló. Middle-aged Erromintxela are mostly passive bilinguals, and the youngest speak only Basque or Spanish. In the Northern Basque Country, however, the language <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> passed on to children. The percentage of speakers among Spanish Erromintxela are higher than 2%, as large numbers of Caló-speaking Romanis moved to the Basque Country in the intense period of industrialisation in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
