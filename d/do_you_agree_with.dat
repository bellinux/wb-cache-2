6000|$|... "I mean," [...] he continued, [...] "the paths which a {{man must}} tread who seeks to serve his country or his household,--the every-day life in which {{sometimes}} intrigue or force is necessary. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Miss Morse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{as may be}} necessary. A man of his art and {{character}} may have recourse to other means to gratify his malice. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Signore?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, I {{have taken}} a great fancy to your new purchase, who, {{according}} to your account, is eminently qualified for the post. Why, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should one}} say what {{one does not}} think," [...] Mary said, sturdily, [...] "it {{would be much better}} if we all <b>did</b> so. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Mr. Hartington?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would be handy for you if we fixed it at the George, at Crawley. Then, if we have choice of place, we might choose Crawley Down, for, except Molesey Hurst, and, maybe, Smitham Bottom, there isn't a spot in the country that would compare with it for a mill. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me something, before I {{allow you}} to run your risk," [...] he said. [...] "Are you {{one of those people}} who think that the tempers of {{children}} are formed by the accidental influences which happen to be about them? Or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me that the tempers of children are inherited from their parents?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, in {{the first}} place, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me that I {{have a right to}} be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied {{experience}} with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not--I ask why not? Some {{women have}} broken through prejudice, {{and why should}} not others? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Fanny, that female medical men--I mean medical women--would be an {{infinite}} boon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{what are}} we but {{political}} antagonists, who can honour one another in private, whilst rending one another to pieces on the arena of public life? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, my lord?" ...|$|R

60|$|And yet, very literally, till, in some {{shape or}} other, it be brought about, we remain cureless; till it {{begin to be}} brought about, the cure does not begin. For Nature and Fact, not Redtape and Semblance, are to this hour the basis of man's life; and on those, through never such strata of these, man and his life and all his {{interests}} do, sooner or later, infallibly come to rest,--and to be supported or be swallowed according as they agree with those. The question is asked of them, not, How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Downing Street and accredited Semblance? but, How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> God's Universe and the actual Reality of things? This Universe has its Laws. If we walk according to the Law, the Law-Maker will befriend us; if not, not. Alas, by no Reform Bill, Ballot-box, Five-point Charter, by no boxes or bills or charters, can you perform this alchemy: 'Given a world of Knaves, to produce an Honesty from their united action!' It is a distillation, once for all, not possible. You pass it through alembic after alembic, it comes out still a Dishonesty, with a new dress on it, a new colour to it. 'While we ourselves continue valets, how can any hero come to govern us?' We are governed, very infallibly, by the 'sham-hero,'--whose name is Quack, whose work and governance is Plausibility, and also is Falsity and Fatuity; to which Nature says, and must say {{when it comes to}} her to speak, eternally No! Nations cease to be befriended of the Law-Maker, when they walk not according to the Law. The Sphinx-question remains unsolved by them, becomes ever more insoluble.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} of settlements," [...] he resumed. [...] "I have already mentioned, Mr. Vanstone, {{at an early}} period of our conversation, that my niece {{presents}} the man of her choice with no other dowry than the most inestimable of all gifts--the gift of herself. This circumstance, however (as you are no doubt aware), does not disentitle me to make the customary stipulations with her future husband. According to the usual course in this matter, my lawyer would see yours--consultations would take place--delays would occur--strangers would be in possession of your intentions--and Mrs. Lecount would, sooner or later, arrive at that knowledge of the truth which you are anxious to keep from her. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me so far?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Independently of the {{interest}} which Mr. Crawford's choice seemed to justify" [...] said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, [...] "his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an advocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and would have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon after four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge, matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he {{were more likely to}} fix." [...] Here was a glance at Fanny. [...] "Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than his brother. He, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, my dear?" ...|$|E

Balzac says, 'All {{women are not}} to themselves what {{no one else is}} to another.' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think not}} until the moment we entered the boat in company. He is a gentlemanly young man; he seems even to be more, and one would not be apt to forget him. He is {{altogether}} superior {{to the rest of}} the set: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had only}} to {{consider}} next, whether I could hope to make any further discoveries, if I continued to be Sir Jervis's guest. The object of my journey had been gained; and I {{had no desire to}} be employed as picture-cleaner. Miss Redwood assisted me in arriving at a decision. I was sent for to speak to her again. The success of her prophecy had raised her spirits. She asked, with ironical humility, if I proposed to honor them by still remaining their guest, after the disturbance that I had provoked. I answered that I proposed to leave by the first train the next morning. 'Will it be convenient for you to travel to some place at a good distance from this part of the world?' she asked. I had my own reasons for going to London, and said so. 'Will you mention that to my brother this evening, just before we sit down to dinner?' she continued. 'And will you tell him plainly that you have no intention of returning to the North? I shall make use of Mrs. Rook's arm, as usual, to help me downstairs--and I will take care that she hears what you say. Without venturing on another prophecy, I will only hint to you that I have my own idea of what will happen; and I should like you to see for yourself, sir, whether my anticipations are realized.' Need I tell you that this strange old woman proved to be right once more? Mr. Rook was released; Mrs. Rook made humble apologies, and laid the whole blame on her husband's temper: and Sir Jervis bade me remark that his method had succeeded in bringing the housekeeper to her senses. Such were the results produced by the announcement of my departure for London--purposely made in Mrs. Rook's hearing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, that my journey to Northumberland has not been taken in vain?" ...|$|E

"True," [...] {{answered}} her mother, [...] "and, {{as the boy}} Prince may take it into his head to conquer Coregos, as well as Regos, I think it best for you to start on your journey to Queen Cor tomorrow morning. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Nikobob?" [...] she added, turning to her husband, the charcoal-burner, who was eating his supper.|$|R

"I cannot exactly {{explain my}} own meaning, perhaps, but I think Miss Grace will {{understand}} me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, Miss Van Cortlandt, in thinking {{it would be}} safer for one who never saw any other mountains to complain of the tameness and monotony of our own, than for one who had passed a whole life among the Andes and the Alps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A light {{flashed on}} the mind, steady and serviceable, but not brilliantly ingenious, of Mr. Macrae. 'This,' he exclaimed rather superfluously, 'accounts for the fiendish skill with which these miscreants took cover when {{pursued by the}} Marine Police.

6000|$|... "Not because <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me,--but because <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} me {{fit to be}} trusted with any {{judgment}} of my own.
