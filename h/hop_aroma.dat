500|$|The sweet wort {{collected}} from sparging {{is put into}} a kettle, or [...] "copper" [...] (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes {{left over from the}} mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and <b>aroma.</b> <b>Hops</b> may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less <b>hop</b> flavour and <b>aroma</b> remains in the beer.|$|R
5000|$|A hopback is a {{traditional}} additional chamber {{that acts as a}} sieve or filter by using whole hops to clear debris (or [...] "trub") from the unfermented (or [...] "green") wort, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase <b>hop</b> <b>aroma</b> in the finished beer. It is a chamber between the brewing kettle and wort chiller. Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber. Hopbacks utilizing a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile <b>hop</b> <b>aroma</b> compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed. Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend {{to make it through the}} hopback). The hopback has mainly been substituted in modern breweries by the whirlpool.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} wort is then boiled, {{usually for}} 60-90 minutes. Hops are added {{at different times}} during the boil, depending on the desired result. Hops added {{at the beginning of}} the boil contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of the boil contribute both flavor and <b>hop</b> <b>aroma.</b> These hop additions are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively. Finings such as Irish moss, a form of seaweed, and others can be added in the final 15-30 minutes of the boil to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.|$|E
5000|$|Aroma hops are {{typically}} {{added to the}} wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart [...] "hop taste" [...] (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or [...] "hop aroma" [...] (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as [...] "dry hopping", which contributes to the <b>hop</b> <b>aroma.</b> Farnesene is a major component in some hops. The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavor and aroma.|$|E
50|$|Styria {{is known}} for its white wine, {{especially}} the Ljutomer Riesling, after the ski resort Pohorje, after summer cultural festivals in Maribor, and after pumpkin seed oil. It is also known as a hop growing area producing Styrian Goldings, a variety of the English <b>aroma</b> <b>hop</b> Fuggles.|$|R

50|$|Their low {{relative}} bitterness {{but strong}} aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European-style lagers, such as Pilsener, Dunkel, and Oktoberfest/Märzen.
