5|$|In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again {{served in}} the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain {{in charge of a}} troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen's {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{that was part of the}} 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army's sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. For the rest of his life <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with a limp and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Cobb {{moved to}} Detroit's architecturally {{significant}} and now historically protected Woodbridge neighborhood, from which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with his dogs {{to the ballpark}} prior to games. The Victorian duplex in which Cobb lived still stands.|$|E

60|$|He {{complained of}} soreness, and said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go home. I {{suggested}} a cab, but he replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>walk.</b>|$|R

50|$|One strange oddity to {{the show}} was that Parker's Boone very rarely used a horse for transportation. <b>He</b> <b>would,</b> instead, <b>walk</b> to his destination, {{sometimes}} incurring interstate travel.|$|R
25|$|While {{there have}} been {{numerous}} cases of extradition of third country nationals from either country to the other, there had never been a US citizen extradited by the USA to the Czech Republic. According to the Czech Ministry of Justice, Dahlgren may not be prosecuted in the USA for crimes committed abroad, and if not extradited, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> free in the USA.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> {{about a mile}} to work {{each day}} and was fond of {{swimming}} {{in one of the}} two nearby lakes (Silver Lake and Lost Lake), and was also more sociable than he had been at Cambridge, where he mostly worked at home apart from giving classes and seminars; at FSU he would usually eat lunch with his colleagues before taking a nap.|$|E
25|$|He was {{eccentric}} and careless. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with {{pipe and}} paper along a thriving thoroughfare oblivious of all; his hat {{shaped like a}} French general's, peak in front and back; shoes well worn; clothes shabby, and was in meeting reticent, even timid... He treated the subject of Socialism plainly and stripped it of utopianism.... The peoples {{of the future will}} dwell in peace where this hardy pioneer warred with the accumulated prejudice, passions, and ignorance of the ages.|$|E
60|$|Peter and Ginger was in 'igh spirits, and, though Sam told 'em {{plain that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>walk</b> about {{with a couple}} of real pickpockets, they wouldn't leave 'im an inch.|$|R
60|$|The train had gone. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>walk</b> the {{ten miles}} home.|$|R
50|$|The poet Vachel Lindsay {{visited his}} family often at their {{vacation}} spot in Empire. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> sometimes <b>walk</b> there on foot, doing a tramp from Illinois to Colorado, chanting poems and doing farm work along the way.|$|R
25|$|In December 1968, Imlach {{was asked}} by Stafford Smythe to give the {{coaching}} job to John McLellan, but Imlach refused and told Smythe to fire him or leave him alone. During the season, Mike Walton walked out on the team, saying he wouldn't play for Imlach again. He returned about a week later. On April 6, 1969, minutes after an early and embarrassing playoff elimination {{at the hands of}} the Boston Bruins, Imlach was fired by the Leafs. He still had a year remaining on his contract, which paid him about $35,000 a year. In the dressing room after the announcement was made, veteran Leafs Johnny Bower and Tim Horton both said they would leave with Imlach (they both returned the following season, although neither would remain with the Leafs for long). Imlach's assistant, Clancy, had previously said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> away if Imlach was fired, but he was persuaded to stay with the team. Jim Gregory was immediately announced as Imlach's replacement as general manager.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1922, Crosby and Polly {{were married}} in the Municipal Building in New York City, and two days later they re-boarded the RMS Aquitania and moved with her {{children}} to Paris, France. There they joined the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned {{by the loss of}} life in World War I and the moral and social values of their parents' generation. Crosby continued his work at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family’s bank in Paris. They found an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans overlooking the Seine, on the exclusive Île Saint-Louis, and Polly would don her red bathing suit and row Crosby down the Seine in his dark business suit, formal hat, umbrella and briefcase to the Place de la Concorde where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> the last few blocks to the bank on Place Vendôme. As she rowed back home, Polly, who was well endowed, would enjoy whistles, jeers and waves from workmen. She said the exercise was good for her breasts.|$|E
500|$|Voorhis also {{involved}} {{himself in the}} local community. He organized cooperatives among the local ranchers and farmers. When strikes occurred, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> the picket lines with the workers. [...] Voorhis gave lectures at Pomona College from 1930 until 1935. He began publishing articles, writing in 1933, [...] "We could produce plenty for all, but we don't do it... {{we will do it}} only when all producing wealth is owned publicly.... Incidentally, we would then be living in the kingdom of God." ...|$|E
50|$|Davis {{started his}} College career at Bradley University {{where he did}} not play {{football}} but soccer. After a year at Bradley Tyler transferred to Penn State. Where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> later <b>walk</b> on to the football team as a place kicker.|$|R
50|$|Albert {{attended}} {{high school}} in Mexico City, Mexico. He first enrolled at Universidad Anáhuac México Norte before accepting a scholarship from the U.S. International University to play soccer. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> later <b>walk</b> on to the football team after a tryout.|$|R
50|$|The fish-man {{was then}} left {{to live with}} his family, though he kept a {{tranquil}} yet odd lifestyle: <b>he</b> <b>would</b> always <b>walk</b> barefoot, and unless he was given clothes, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>walk</b> around in the nude. He never really talked; at most <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sometimes mutter words such as tobacco, bread or wine, but without any link to the desire of smoking, eating or drinking. When he ate, he did it with avidity, but then he was able not to eat for a week at a time. He was easygoing and even obliging, and whichever simple task he was asked to do, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do it promptly but without enthusiasm. After nine years living in such a fashion, he went to the sea to swim and was never seen again.|$|R
500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. I {{was scared to death}} of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E
500|$|Moustache {{is said to}} {{have left}} the cuirassiers after he was struck by a cavalryman with the flat of his sword. [...] De Fivas says that he {{attached}} himself to a unit of dragoons which he followed to Spain, taking part in two campaigns with them during which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> ahead of their column and bark warnings whenever he heard a noise. [...] During a battle in the Sierra Morena mountain range in southern Spain Moustache is alleged to have led back to camp the horses of dragoons killed on the battlefield. [...] Shortly after this he {{is said to have}} been secretly taken by a Colonel who wished to own him. [...] After spending seventeen days in captivity the dog apparently escaped by an open window and joined with a gunboat crew. [...] Afterwards he participated in the Battle of Badajoz where he was struck by a cannonball and killed on 11 March 1812, at the age of twelve years.|$|E
500|$|When Storm {{became a}} {{professional}} singer, {{he changed his}} name to Rory Storm by deed poll, and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to Stormsville. Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink Vauxhall Cresta for £800 in cash. A young man was once caught by a porter at Bootle railway station writing [...] "I love Rory" [...] over the walls, and when questioned, {{it turned out to be}} Storm himself. The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm sometimes wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> over to the piano and comb his blond hair with an oversized comb. Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree-decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits. Storm also wore an Elvis-style gold lamé suit. When they first appeared at Butlins holiday camp Storm wore a turquoise suit with a gold lamé shirt, while the group wore fluorescent suits.|$|E
60|$|The farmer {{had offered}} to drive him back to Bixter, but our hero had stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>walk</b> and take the short cut through the woods. When {{he arrived at the}} village he found Roger {{wondering}} what had become of him.|$|R
60|$|He {{forgot that}} he had rung the bell. A very young servant had {{answered}} the door and was staring at him. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have <b>walked</b> in if the small servant had not planted herself deliberately in his way. It recalled him to himself.|$|R
50|$|Packer {{sustained}} catastrophic {{spinal cord}} injuries in 2008, whilst on operational duty with British military forces in Iraq. He suffered a motor-complete T12/L1 spinal cord injury, and was told <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>walk</b> again. Following surgery and recuperation, his injury improved to T12/L1 motor-incomplete.|$|R
500|$|Murphy hounded Pat Kiernan {{until he}} got an {{audition}} at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing {{the part of a}} volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E
2500|$|By early 1993, Atta {{had moved}} into {{university}} housing; he shared an apartment in Centrumshaus with two roommates. He remained at Centrumshaus until 1998. During that time, his roommates became frustrated with Atta, who seldom cleaned, and kept to himself {{to the extent that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> {{in and out of a}} room without acknowledging others. Beyond anything else, they could not deal with Atta's personality, described as [...] "complete, almost aggressive insularity".|$|E
2500|$|McMahon {{served as}} a counter to the {{notoriously}} shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get [...] "butterflies" [...] in his stomach every time <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> onto a stage and would use that nervousness {{as a source of}} energy. [...] His famous opening line, [...] "Heeere's Johnny!", was used in the 1980 horror film The Shining by the character Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) as he goes after his wife and child with an axe.|$|E
60|$|Demas cried {{again that}} he also {{was one of their}} company, a pilgrim like themselves, and that, if they would tarry a little, <b>he</b> also himself <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with them.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, he {{was badly}} wounded, so the {{physicians}} thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>walk</b> again. Nevertheless, he regained strength and {{took part in}} more than 1500 competitions as an equestrian and as a pentathlete and reached 1200 good placements. Lichtner-Hoyer took part in 24 world and European Championships.|$|R
50|$|Morrison wrote most of {{the songs}} while he was staying with Herbie Armstrong in the Cotswold village of Epwell, England, {{and the sense of}} place is {{reflected}} {{in the spirit of the}} music. During this time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>walk</b> through the fields with his guitar composing the future album's songs.|$|R
2500|$|In 1931 the British {{authorities}} {{requested that}} the chief rabbi appoint a prison chaplain who would visit the captives on Shabbat. Rabbi Aryeh Levine became famous as the [...] "Rabbi of the Prisoners". Every Sabbath, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> from his home to the Russian Compound, to conduct services with the prisoners and keep them company. He {{was known as the}} [...] "tzaddik (righteous person) of Jerusalem". In 1965, [...] "Rav Aryeh" [...] was honored at a ceremony assembled by the veteran underground resistance fighters. Timed to take place on his 80th birthday, it was held in the courtyard of the old central prison.|$|E
2500|$|He {{then moved}} to Chelsea for a fee of [...] £50 and was made club captain. Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his {{defenders}} were not trying hard enough, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal {{in an effort to}} distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being. Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, Bradford City.|$|E
2500|$|In interviews, he {{has also}} stated {{that there may have}} been an {{alternate}} reason, namely, that the company wanted to fire him. He also criticized McMahon for the cavalier attitude he had given him on the day he quit. In his recollection, Ross was fired by McMahon with exactly the same demeanor while struck with a bout of Bell's palsy in 1994, a time when Ross' [...] "usefulness" [...] had run out. Lawler felt that Carter's release was an attempt to remove him as well, stating that the company was well-aware that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> out alongside his wife. Lawler's replacement with Paul Heyman launched a theory in which Heyman was promoted at Lawler's expense. Internet rumors circulated that the company was on better terms with Heyman than Lawler, and used remarks Lawler had made in criticism of ECW to launch a theory whereby Heyman wanted Lawler out. Lawler has stated repeatedly that he has no resentment towards Heyman, accusing the media and internet theorists of spreading false information.|$|E
50|$|Major Phil Packer - {{was injured}} in a rocket attack in Basra on 18 February 2008. He lost {{the use of his}} legs and was told <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>walk</b> again. However, he {{completed}} the Flora London Marathon in April 2008, walking 2 miles a day over a 2-week period.|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{you were}} {{foolish enough to}} horse about, he'd bowl at you, coming in off just one yard and fire down the fastest ball you ever faced. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> then <b>walk</b> down the wicket, and, in a lazy West Indian drawl, say, [...] "Don't mess about in my net sessions"." ...|$|R
60|$|Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>walk</b> down to Cedarville for him, {{to buy him}} a baseball.
