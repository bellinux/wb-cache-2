50|$|The Halone House {{reflects}} Alex Halone's artistry in stonework, with {{a variety}} of fanciful masonry treatments. At its core, the house is an approximately square two-story house, built in square sandstone, with a hipped roof. To the front, a porch has been added in very rough travertine stone with a rubble jack arch over the front door. A garage flanks the porch to the left. On {{the east side of the}} house is a stacked and squared chimney extending the height of the first floor, supporting an <b>enclosed</b> <b>balcony.</b> The flue extends between two windows from the main house looking on top the balcony. From the top of the balcony rises a tapering stucco flue studded with rubble. The rear of the house is capped by a second-story addition, clad in shingles. The west side is rough in appearance and was apparently considered a secondary elevation.|$|E
50|$|The front (eastern) {{facade of}} the house is divided into three bays by a central {{projecting}} bay which houses the main entrance on the ground floor and an <b>enclosed</b> <b>balcony</b> on the upper floor.

The main entrance has a later timber double door, flanked by early timber louvred panels that extend from waist height to lintel height. Immediately below these panels are narrow, rendered brick garden beds. Above the doorway is a narrow concrete ledge with a patterned edge detail and above this the name Floriana is set in relief into the render. Decorated square pillars stand at each corner of the entrance bay, extending up to window height on the first floor and containing small flower boxes on top. The enclosed front balcony on the upper level of the entrance bay has early timber-framed casement windows on all three sides. These double windows open outwards with three lights in each leaf, two of which (the top and bottom) are patterned art glass.|$|E

The oblast's governor estimated the damage to buildings at more than 1 billion rubles (approximately US$33 million). Chelyabinsk authorities said that broken windows of apartment homes, but not the glazing of <b>enclosed</b> <b>balconies,</b> would be replaced at the state's expense. One of the buildings damaged in the blast was the Traktor Sport Palace, home arena of Traktor Chelyabinsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

50|$|The {{changing}} fire {{life safety}} requirements for high rise flats caused Edgewater Towers {{to be treated}} as a test case for fire life safety and Edgewater Towers was required to install an improved fire life safety system by the Port Phillip Council in the late 1980s. The Port Phillip Council required Edgewater Towers to have a further fire life safety upgrade in 2002 and was subsequently fitted with a fire sprinkler protection system and fully addressable automatic fire detection and alarm system between 2005 and 2008, and certified complete 2014. The earlier fire life safety upgrade between 1989 and 1995 included fire hose reels, a smoke and heat detection system, enclosure of the previously open West stairwell, sealing of floor penetrations, closure of the mail chute, emergency and exit lighting, removal of glazed timber doors in the corridors, modifications to both stairs to discharge directly to outdoors, fire rated doors, fire rated <b>enclosed</b> <b>balcony</b> ends and blocking up corridor clerestory glazing to each flat to achieve the necessary 1-hour fire-resistance rating. The sprinkler fire protection system was activated in August 2013, when a fire started on a balcony on the 11th. floor. The Age newspaper carried the story. Edgewater Towers has an Essential Safety Measures, Certificate of Final Inspection dated 14 July 2014 displayed in the lobby.|$|E
50|$|Edinburgh Corporation {{inherited}} 38 electric trams {{from the}} Leith system, and almost 200 Edinburgh cable car bodies {{were converted to}} electric propulsion in the period 1921-24. There was initially some experimentation with bogie trucks (including attempts to electrify the original cable car chassis) but it was quickly decided to standardise on new 4-wheel trucks. Most of these early cars had originally been open top, but most were modernised with top covers and the later survivors also received vestibule screens and <b>enclosed</b> <b>balconies.</b> The last open top car was scrapped in 1934 and the final ex-Leith cars were withdrawn in 1936, {{but some of the}} converted cable cars remained in service until 1947. The body of car 226 (a former cable car dating from 1903 and withdrawn in 1938) was secured for preservation in 1987 after being used as a holiday chalet, and is undergoing restoration.|$|R

5000|$|The flats were {{originally}} let at high rents to wealthy residents, including Max Miller, Rex Harrison and Terence Rattigan, and {{features such as}} <b>enclosed</b> <b>balconies</b> and England's first penthouse suites made the 72-apartment, 11-storey building [...] "one of the most desirable and sought-after addresses in Brighton and Hove". Its fortunes changed dramatically from the 1970s, though, as a succession of complex court cases set leaseholders, freeholders and landlords against each other while the building rotted.

Proposals to refurbish the block came to nothing until the court cases concluded in 2004 and Sir Terence Conran's architectural practice was brought in. With an investment of £5 million, raised entirely by the residents, Embassy Court was overhauled: by 2006 it had been restored to its original status as a high-class residence, in contrast to its poor late-20th-century reputation.|$|R
50|$|The {{place is}} {{significant}} because the Zammits selected a site in the best residential street in Cairns, employed a notable architect (Edwin R Orchard) and erected a substantial two-storey house that incorporated a number of traditional Maltese elements within the overall format of a Queensland house of its era. The design is unique in that it incorporates the principal characteristics a modern interwar house - multi-hipped roof, wide overhanging eaves, <b>enclosed</b> <b>balconies</b> and Art Moderne (Art Deco) decorative interior detailing - with the elements of traditional Maltese housing. These elements included: the provision of a prominent, centrally positioned ground floor entrance emphasised by a semi-enclosed balcony above the entrance vestibule and louvred timber panels {{either side of the}} main door; the whole of the ground floor taken up by a large ballroom; and {{at the core of the}} house, a substantial and decorative winding staircase which is of aesthetic value in its own right.

5000|$|At the {{junction}} of Western Street and Kings Road on Brighton seafront, just on the Brighton side of the ancient parish boundary between Brighton and Hove, stood a 19th-century villa called Western House. Owners included Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor and the drag king Vesta Tilley. In 1930 the site was chosen for redevelopment and the building and its grounds were demolished. Nothing took its place immediately, though, except for a temporary racetrack and miniature golf course. Developers Maddox Properties acquired the site and in 1934 enlisted Wells Coates, a Modernist architect responsible for the striking Isokon building in London earlier that year, to design a block of luxury flats as a speculative development. Embassy Court was completed in 1935. Its reinforced concrete structure and steel-framed doors and windows were distinctive features, and other facilities included a ground-floor bank, partly <b>enclosed</b> <b>balconies</b> to {{every one of the}} 72 flats, and England's first penthouse suites. These occupied the top (11th) floor; the other ten storeys had seven flats each. Each flat was [...] "all-electric", including the space heating in the form of ceiling panels.
