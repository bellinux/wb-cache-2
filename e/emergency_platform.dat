5000|$|Tsuen Wan West (...) is an {{underground}} MTR station in Tsuen Wan West, New Territories, Hong Kong. It is located between Mei Foo and Kam Sheung Road stations on the West Rail Line. There is an <b>emergency</b> <b>platform</b> {{on the southern}} side of the station.|$|E
5000|$|At {{that time}} the station had five platforms: Platform 1 at the {{south-east}} end of the station and two island platforms. Platforms 1 and 2 were essentially bay platforms, each of the same length (and shorter than the other three). They {{were used for the}} Carmarthen services (though Platform 2 was occasionally used for main-line trains). The Carmarthen line was closed in 1965. The former Platform 3 {{is on the other side}} of Platform 2; it is the only platform still in use for mainline rail, and has been redesignated as Platform 1 in recent years. The former Platform 4 (closed in 1982, track removed) is now taken up by the [...] "Craft" [...] freecycling shop. At {{that time the}} signal box was also closed. Access to the station and the station facilities is now primarily via the original 1864 building.The running-around line between these two, for locomotive-hauled trains, still exists. Platform 5 (closed in the 1960s) was an <b>emergency</b> <b>platform</b> on the other side of Platform 4, but little trace remains. This area is now an oil storage area and the marshalling yard has become the Rheidol Retail Park.With the decline of railway usage and of local tourism, the facilities were far too large for their purpose. The railway yard was lifted in the 1980s and the row of shops in front, known as Western Parade, was demolished in the 1990s to allow construction of a new retail park and bus station. The 1925 station building has seen several uses, including as a local museum, but was eventually sold off and converted into a Wetherspoons pub. This conversion maintained the architecture and won awards. Other parts of the building have become an Indian restaurant, office space and accommodation for a local furniture recycling scheme.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{provide a}} {{reliable}} assistance to patients, emergency and intensive care systems have increased demands for {{quality of service}} at different levels, with the MAC layer assuming special relevance. The Low Power Real Time (LPRT) MAC protocol presents suitable characteristics to be deployed in <b>emergency</b> <b>platforms</b> due to its efficient bandwidth allocation, low energy consumption, and bounded latency. Yet, this protocol may still present a significant packet loss ratio in a wireless channel affected by errors. In order to define a MAC protocol more robust to bit error conditions and able to fulfill the required quality of service, solutions based on short size beacons and multiple retransmissions are proposed and tested. Results show that such strategies lead to meaningful improvements regarding packet loss ratio, without compromising significantly the energy consumption.

40|$|Abstract — Even {{in highly}} {{developed}} western regions, huge riveraine floods {{are a great}} challenge for flood response management. The cooperation of different response authorities and organizations under time critical conditions in a highly dynamic environment require support with modern IT methods and systems. Present Flood Information Systems still do not sufficiently focus on supporting the workflow of planning and carrying out flood response actions. This paper introduces a new process centric approach, which improves the coordination and information workflows of Emergency Operation Centers (EOC) and involved services. Formal process models as core of a process driven <b>emergency</b> management <b>platform</b> provide the responsible agent with appropriate data and analyses along defined <b>emergency</b> processes. The <b>platform</b> guides the EOC officers and involved parties through the organizational steps of flood response actions. Coordinated information flow and automatic multi-channel notifications are ensured throughout the process. The developed approach is successfully validated using flood scenarios with real-world data. The {{results show that the}} approach improves information flow in the EOC and to external organizations and enhances coordinated work-sharing of EOC team members during flood response Index Term — process models; emergency management system; flood response; webGIS I...|$|R

30|$|Guiding {{interactions}} among actors and accessing commons require protocols that reduce ambiguity {{and increase the}} effectiveness and efficiency of interaction. There are self-organizing processes associated with each protocol that actors follow {{in order to achieve}} control and coordination. In a digital organization, actors use their collaborative tools to signal both the tasks to be done and the availability of resources to perform them. Although protocols are specific to the type of collaboration, there are commonalities. Military and <b>emergency</b> response <b>platforms,</b> for example, have protocols and processes for publishing updates to the situation awareness database and subscribing to particular types of information, such as new events occurring in a geographic area (DeMarco, 2016; Liang and Gao, 2010). Similarly, platforms for collaborative project management (Chen et al. 2003) have protocols for inviting collaborators, sharing information about the whole project or particular tasks, and alerting collaborators to changes affecting their portion of the project (c.f. www.smartsheet.com). The infrastructure that allows the actors to connect with one another consists of communication networks and computer servers.|$|R
50|$|An {{example is}} an {{automobile}} detected by an obstruction detector (踏切障害物検知装置, fumikiri shōgaibutsu kenchi sōchi) stuck {{at a level}} crossing, activating the obstruction-warning device at the crossing. Another use is to guard against rockfalls; detection wires are installed {{at the bottom of}} cliffs, activating the signal when the wires are broken by rocks. On some <b>platforms,</b> <b>emergency</b> buttons or detection mats activate the obstruction-warning signal (mounted on the home signal) if a person falls on the track. Obstruction-warning signals are installed at the entrance of long tunnels or areas of dense traffic (such as quadruple-track sections); these activate if an accident is detected, preventing further damage.|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{response}} {{agencies that}} need to care for large crowds in real-life events, report a constant lack in human volunteers in large numbers for training purposes. Moreover, existing computerized training aides either totally omit affected crowds in their scenarios, or represent them as computer generated models. A potential solution that can provide real human input in large numbers for training purposes {{can be found in}} the form of Massive Multi-user Online Role-Playing computer Games (MMORPGs) that attract millions of users on a daily basis. In order to evaluate the use of MMORPGs as an <b>emergency</b> simulation <b>platform</b> I had to examine the in-game behaviour of participants, usability issues, data collection methods, and data reliability. I did so by constructing a multi-user computer game that included food shortage and a pandemic spread scenarios. Data collected included every possible item that could be technically logged, both qualitative (questionnaires, user’s self tagging of events) and quantitative (all in-game actions and their coordinates, players and virtual environment in-game status). The abundance of data enabled easy triangulation and verification. The main findings were: participants attention span was about 90 minutes, they demonstrated only a narrow range of behaviours necessary for their in-game survival, and this behaviour followed loosely real life behaviour patterns. Usability wise participants ignored interface components and in-game tasks that interfered with their game flow. Data reliability: unlike other methods that rely solely on participants accounts, the game had the ability to compare between actions to questionnaire answers, and was able to detect inconsistencies between people’s actions within the game and their accounts of their actions. The ability to create spatial maps of event types enabled a fast way to visually analyze data. The research concludes that MMORPGs can be used as an <b>emergency</b> simulation <b>platform</b> if: 1) its duration fits the participants’ attention span (as a result aspects of human behaviour that happen over a prolonged period of time will not be demonstrated); 2) the demographic composition of participants fits that of the population examined by the simulation; 3) participants should be properly reimbursed for their time; 4) it is known that participants’ in-game behaviour might be negatively influenced by lack of real-life experience of similar events; 5) in-game rules and mechanisms are set to filter out game abuse; 6) preliminary sessions are run to determine ideal attention span and data skewing factor...|$|R
