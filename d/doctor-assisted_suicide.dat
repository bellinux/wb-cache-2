More recently, 2004's Measure 37 reflects a backlash against such land-use laws. However, a further ballot measure in 2007, Measure 49, curtailed many of the provisions of 37.|$|E
25|$|Circumvention {{tourism is}} also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical {{services}} that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that aren’t yet approved in the home country, abortion, and <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b> Abortion tourism can be found most commonly in Europe, where travel between countries is relatively simple. Ireland and Poland, two European countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, have {{the highest rates of}} circumvention tourism. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service. There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services. With Women on Waves, the organization uses a mobile clinic aboard a ship to provide medical abortions in international waters, where the law of the country whose flag is flown applies.|$|E

50|$|Suicide was {{considered}} a criminal offence in Canada until 1972. Physician-assisted suicide has been legal in the Province of Quebec since June 5, 2014. It was declared legal across the country because of the Supreme Court of Canada decision Carter v Canada (AG), of February 6, 2015.

5000|$|After {{a lengthy}} delay, the House of Commons passed a Bill (C-14) in mid-June 2016 {{that would allow}} for <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> {{in the case of}} a {{terminal}} illness.

However, when it became apparent that the elected House of Commons would not accept the amendment, a final vote was held on 17 June 2016. At that time, a majority agreed with the restrictive wording provided by the House of Commons indicating that [...] "only patients suffering from incurable illness whose natural death is 'reasonably foreseeable' are eligible for a medically assisted death," [...] as summarized by the Toronto Star. Critics of the Bill indicate that the Carter decision was broader, including desperately ill individuals and not only those who are terminally ill or near death. The House of Commons did accept a few Senate amendments, such as requiring that patients be counselled about alternatives, including palliative care and barring beneficiaries from acting in the euthanasia.

In the late 90s he and correspondent John Miller investigated anti-government militias, as well as Eric Rudolph of the Army of God’s string of abortion clinic attacks. Klein and correspondent Elizabeth Vargas investigated the wrongful conviction of a woman named Betty Tyson and helped overturn her conviction, a project which earned Vargas her first Emmy nomination. Klein also filmed, edited and produced documentary specials for Nightline, following people {{over long periods of}} time, including the abortion clinic bombing victim Emily Lyons as she spent her first year recovering from a near-fatal blast.

Senators such as Serge Joyal who disagree with the restrictive wording believe that the provinces should refer the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada for an opinion in order to preclude the need for individuals to proceed with such an Appeal and incur the significant expense of doing so.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the role of narratives within public policy, surrounding the issue of <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b> Specifically, this study attempts to examine the way(s) in which narratives both shape and influence public policy; pertaining to Measure 16, Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. Narrative communication involving the issues of Measure 16 and <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> exist in a variety of facets. These include letters sent to reader response forums in newspapers and magazines, the Oregon Voters Pamphlet, and letters sent directly to government officials and offices at the State Capitol. By examining the role of narrative within the <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> debate, this study will demonstrate how the discourse operates (either intentionally or unintentionally) from a rhetorical standpoint, which influences the way voters cast ballots at the voting booth. A contemporary approach to narrative, as illustrated by Sonja K. Foss, will be applied in this study as a method for investigating narratives pertaining to Measure 16 and the controversy of <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b> Foss' approach works effectively in explaining the use of narratives as a means of influencing within the public policy arena. This study attempts to show how language is constructed in order to shape and promote views towards ballot measures and human rights issues. Additionally, this study intends to increase the understanding of narrative's function within discourse heavily relied upon by voters and lawmakers during election time...|$|E

40|$|Whether persons {{wishing to}} have <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> or {{voluntary}} active euthanasia {{may make a}} court application based on their rights in the Constitution has not been answered by the Appeal Court. Therefore, if Parliament does not intervene beforehand, such applications can be made – provided the applicants have legal standing, full arguments are presented regarding local and foreign law, and the application evidence is comprehensive and accurate. The Appeal Court indicated that the question should be answered by Parliament because ‘issues engaging profound moral questions beyond the remit of judges to determine, should {{be decided by the}} representatives {{of the people of the}} country as a whole’. However, the Government has not implemented any recommendations on <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and voluntary active euthanasia made by the South African Law Commission 20 years ago. The courts may still develop the law on doctor-assisted death, which may take into account developments in medical practice. Furthermore, ‘the possibility of a special defence for medical practitioners or carers would arise and have to be explored’. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years, {{numerous}} public opinion surveys have indicated growing support for physician. assisted suicide, euthanasia, T ~ r ght-to-die legislation. This pro-euthanasia trend, how-ever, goes against fundamental Jucleo-Christian principles that have traditionaUy been the bulwark against he acceptance of euthanasia. Using Chaves's (I 994) &finition of secularization as the declining scope of religious authority, u,e examine {{to what extent}} pe@le are likely to reject raditional sanctions against euthanasia nd approve physician-assisted suicide. We find that the odds of the nonreligious approving physician. assisted suicide are three {{times greater than the}} religious; yet, only self-identified evangelical nd liberal Protestants ate significantly different from the nonreli~ous in attitudes tott,ards physician-assisted suicide. We suggest that secularization does not uniformly affect all reli~~ous groups. Although in some traditions, people's euthanasia attitucles are not congruent with the positions of their religious authorities, in other traditions, most notably evangelicalism, religious authority appears to remain strong. In June 1997, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state governments have the right to outlaw <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b> TheCourt's decision, however, did not silence the divisive national debate between advo-cates and opponents of the right to die. The mass media has directed our attention to Oregonians voting to allow physician-assisted suicide and juries acquitting Dr. Jack Kevorkian of killing terminally ill patients. At the same time, the Denver headquarters of the Hemlock Society, a 25, 000 member society that favors <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> for the terminally ill, was recently stormed by members of the oppositional group Not Dead Yet. Clearly, Americans hold diverse opinions on the right to die. Yet, over the past fifty years, public opinion has moved steadily in favor of the right of the terminally ill to have medical treatment withheld or withdrawn. Numerous public opinion surveys indicate growing support for physician-assisted suicide...|$|E

In Study 1, participants with moderate or extreme attitudes toward <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> generated three (easy) or seven (hard) arguments that either supported or countered their opinion toward the issue prior to indicating {{the strength of their}} attitude. Participants with moderate attitudes rated their opinions as more intense, personally important, and held with greater certainty when they had generated either a small number of supporting arguments or a large number of opposing arguments. Ratings provided by individuals with extreme attitudes were unaffected by the argument generation task. In Study 2, the impact of ease of recall on strength-related judgments was eliminated when it was rendered nondiagnostic by a misattribution manipulation. Implications of these findings for attitude strength and other judgmental phenomena are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The November 2012 {{election}} {{brought in}} many noteworthy results—the reelection of America’s first black president, Barack Obama, with a surprising {{sweep of the}} swing states; the consigning of Mitt Romney to the ashcan of political history after a debate-win-fueled, strong final run; the losses by two Republican Senate candidates who were favored to win before making offensive comments about rape; and the election of Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay U.

To the contrary, this coming year the Court will consider the constitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, address the application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to religious use of drugs, and determine whether the federal government can effectively preempt Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s decision to legalize <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b> It will revisit contemporary federalism and abortion doctrines, clarify the scope of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and address important questions in antitrust and criminal procedure.

40|$|As {{the title}} indicates, this Essay {{is based on}} an {{observation}} and a strange but true tale. The observation, which will probably strike many people as uncontroversial—perhaps even clichéd—is that law and legal procedures are at the core of American self-identity and are woven deeply into the fabric of our culture. This is not a new insight. Indeed, de Tocqueville’s famous observation that “[s]carcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question” has been repeated so often that it has itself become a part of our national lore. Throughout the twentieth century, de Tocqueville’s observation remained accurate. From the Scopes monkey trial to the trial of O. J. Simpson, from the national debate over abortion to the more recent clashes over <b>doctor-assisted</b> <b>suicide,</b> from the success of novelist John Grisham to the explosion of law shows on television, we can easily see that our national obsession with law continues unabated. And, even though lawyers are often objects of derision, when the chips are down, we Americans are apt to frame our struggles in the language of competing rights and to fight our battles in a legal forum...|$|E
