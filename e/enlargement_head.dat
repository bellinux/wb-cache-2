40|$|AbstractThe Shank {{family of}} {{proteins}} interacts with NMDA receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor complexes in the postsynaptic density (PSD).

Shank and Homer cooperate to induce accumulation of IP 3 receptors in dendritic spines and formation of putative multisynapse spines.

These data suggest a central role for the Shank scaffold in the structural and functional organization of the dendritic spine and synaptic junction...|$|R
40|$|Non-rigid {{registration}} algorithms {{have been}} proposed {{over the years to}} register medical images to each other. One class of applications for these algorithms is the automatic segmentation of structures and substructures using a predefined atlas. But these algorithms have been limited to image volumes without gross abnormalities or pathologies and have thus been of limited use for applications such as the automatic segmentation of radiation sensitive structures for radiation therapy planning. The algorithm we present in this paper is an extension of a non-rigid registration algorithm we have previously developed (the Adaptive Basis Algorithm). This extension permits the use of the algorithm for the automatic segmentation of medical images even when structures have been displaced substantially. The algorithm automatically adjusts the stiffness of the transformation to permit larger displacements over regions that are known to be very compliant and smaller displacements over regions that are known to be less compliant. The stiffness map can be defined once and for all in an atlas. The algorithm has been tested and evaluated on head image volumes with large ventricular <b>enlargements</b> and <b>head</b> image volumes with large space-occupying lesions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PSD- 95 /SAP 90 {{family of}} {{scaffold}} proteins organizes the postsynaptic density (PSD) and regulates NMDA receptor signaling at excitatory synapses. We report that SPAR, a Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP), {{interacts with the}} guanylate kinase-like domain of PSD- 95 and forms a complex with PSD- 95 and NMDA receptors in brain. In heterologous cells, SPAR reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and recruits PSD- 95 to F-actin. In hippocampal neurons, SPAR localizes to dendritic spines and causes <b>enlargement</b> of spine <b>heads,</b> many of which adopt an irregular appearance with putative multiple synapses. Dominant negative SPAR constructs cause narrowing and elongation of spines.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic {{pancreatitis}} (CP) is {{a chronic}} condition associated with pancreatic fibrosis. A small subgroup {{of patients with}} CP develop <b>enlargement</b> of the <b>head</b> of the pancreas (EHP). This study examined some of the mechanisms {{that may lead to}} the development of EHP. SUMMARY BACKGROUND: The c-erb B- 2 protooncogene encodes a 185 -kDa transmembrane growth factor receptor (p 185) that regulates cell growth and differentiation. METHODS: The authors analyzed c-erb B- 2 expression in samples obtained from the head of the pancreas from 26 patients with CP (5 women, 21 men) using immunohistochemical and molecular technique. A diagnosis of CP with EHP was made when the vertical pancreatic head diameter was greater than 4 cm (14 patients), as determined by contrast-enhanced computed axial tomography scan. Pancreatic tissues from 15 healthy organ donors served as control subjects. RESULTS: In all patients without EHP and in the healthy control subjects, p 185 immunoreactivity was present at low levels. In contrast, strong p 185 immunoreactivity was observed in acinar and ductal cells in all patients with EHP. By in situ hybridization, c-erb B- 2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) grains were expressed at high levels in patients with CP with EHP in both ductal and acinar cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 4. 5 -fold increase (p < 0. 001) in c-erb B- 2 mRNA levels in patients with EHP compared with patients without EHP and healthy control subjects. Southern blot analysis did not reveal c-erb B- 2 gene amplification or rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the c-erb B- 2 is not overexpressed in most patients with CP. However, its overexpression in patients with CP with EHP suggest that c-erb B- 2 may contribute to the pathophysiologic processes that lead to pancreatic <b>head</b> <b>enlargement...</b>|$|R
