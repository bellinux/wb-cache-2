Approach: The motorcycle tested, the used Honda Wave 125 model, was properly tuned at the rich relative air-fuel ratio (λ) 0. 85, which theoretically gave the maximum power output. For the use of E 100, the engine required richer air-fuel mixture condition, the main nozzle and <b>idle</b> <b>nozzle</b> sizes were therefore increased from the sizes used for gasoline 91; by 21. 4 % from 0. 78 mm for the main nozzle and 76 % from 0. 35 mm for the <b>idle</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Due to having three times higher in heat of vaporization, the stronger current ignition coil was used instead. This eased the engine starting without any trace amount of gasoline. The ignition timing was advanced by about + 9 Ocrank angle to suit E 100 ’s high octane number of 107.

Approach: The motorcycle tested, the used Honda Wave 125 model, was properly tuned at the rich relative air-fuel ratio (λ) 0. 85, which theoretically gave the maximum power output. For the use of E 100, the engine required richer air-fuel mixture condition, the main nozzle and <b>idle</b> <b>nozzle</b> sizes were therefore increased from the sizes used for gasoline 91; by 21. 4 % from 0. 78 mm for the main nozzle and 76 % from 0. 35 mm for the <b>idle</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Due to having three times higher in heat of vaporization, the stronger current ignition coil was used instead. This eased the engine starting without any trace amount of gasoline. The ignition timing was advanced by about + 9 Ocrank angle to suit E 100 ’s high octane number of 107. Results: The performance test results of E 100 on dynamometer showed that the maximum power output was 9 hp@ 7428 rpm and the maximum torque was 11 Nm@ 4728 rpm. Comparing to the use of gasoline 91, the engine performance decreased 12 - 15 % over the speed range of around 4000 - 8000 rpm. From the road tests; city road test and long driving test, at the average speed of 60 km h - 1 the average consumption rate of E 100 was about 25 - 28 % more. The calculated fuel conversion efficiency of E 100 was 38. 2 % higher. For emission measurements when using E 100, the concentrations of CO and of HC were 3. 14 vol % and 2143 ppm. Those were higher than in the exhaust of the use of gasoline 91 but below the regulations which required 1. 0 condition. Since a particular instrument was not available, aldehyde concentration in the E 100 ’s emission was not measured. Conclusion: It clearly confirmed that E 100, 95. 5 vol % ethanol, can be effectively used as an alternative fuel in used 4 -stroke motorcycles whose carburetors were purposely designed for the use of gasoline 91. If the engines were properly tuned up and modified to best suit the E 100 ’s characteristics while maintaining the compression ratio, the motorcycles performed as efficient as fueling gasoline 91...|$|E
