40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} routing algorithms {{is an important}} issue in dense ad hoc wireless networks. Previous theoretical work has shown that benefits can be achieved through the creation of a set of data "highways" that carry packets across the network, from source(s) to sink(s). Current approaches to the design of these highways however require a-priori knowledge of the global network topology, with consequent communications burden and scalability issues, particularly with regard to reconfiguration after node failures. In this chapter, we describe a bio-inspired approach to generating these <b>data</b> <b>highways</b> through a distributed reaction-diffusion model that uses localized convolution with activation-inhibition filters. The result is the distributed emergence of <b>data</b> <b>highways</b> that can be tuned to provide appropriate highway separation and connection to data sinks.

40|$|Currently in {{transportation}} modeling, travel {{time is the}} most important factor in decisions regarding transport modes, destinations and routes. The calculation of travel time is deployed by volume-delay functions, a sub-model of route assignment procedure, using the correlation between increasing numbers of vehicles on a road and the road’s restrictive capacity. By investigating existing volume-delay functions, a clear gap is seen, demonstrating that current functions are not suited to reflect the empirically known large impact of trucks on passenger car travel times. This issue becomes crucial when transport models are used to reflect future scenarios where goods transportation is expected to be increased greatly, and when transport models cover passenger and commercial traffic together. This article presents a new volume-delay function which successfully covers trucks’ impact on traffic flow in the case of Germany very well, and with slightly deviations also North America. The function is developed by using ideal-type data for German motorways.

The data show that the truck crash cost per VMT is lowest for rural interstates such as the Turnpike and highest for the roads to which truck traffic diverted. Using the elasticity of demand for truck use of toll roads, we then estimate that the crash cost of trucks diverted from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads during 2004 at more than US$ 38 million, which far exceeds the revenue benefit.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether county syphilis rates were increased along Interstate Highway 95 (I- 95) in North Carolina during a recent epidemic. METHODS: Ecological data on syphilis cases demographic <b>data,</b> <b>highway</b> data, and drug activity data were used to conduct a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of North Carolina countries from 1985 to 1994. Crude and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were determined by means of standard and longitudinal Poisson regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and drug use. RESULTS: Ten-year syphilis rates in I- 95 counties greatly exceeded rates in non-I- 95 counties (38 vs 16 cases per 100, 000 persons) and remained higher after adjustment for race, age, sex, poverty, large cities, and drug activity (adjusted IRR = 2. 05, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 84, 2. 28). Syphilis rates were stable until 1989, when rates increased sharply in I- 95 counties but remained stable in non-I- 95 counties. Increased drug activity in I- 95 counties preceded the rise in syphilis cases.
