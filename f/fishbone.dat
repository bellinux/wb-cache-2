5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had {{a suspected}} blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a <b>fishbone</b> that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September {{he turned on the}} Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fishbones</b> {{is a new}} {{stimulation}} {{technology that}} aims to provide hydraulic fracturing like stimulation while also leaving the operator in full control of the stimulation process. The technology creates up to several hundred thin, 12 meter long laterals that extend orthogonally out from the wellbore. This increases the effective wellbore radius and improves well to reservoir communication. Three full scale tests of <b>Fishbones</b> have previously been conducted and found successful. This thesis considers fine scale simulation of a well with <b>Fishbones</b> in ECLIPSE. Two different ways of modeling the <b>Fishbones</b> laterals, as fractures and as laterals, are compared. Modeling the <b>Fishbones</b> laterals as fractures was found to give a more accurate solution than defining them as laterals, but with an increased run time. Several cases that investigated the effect of <b>Fishbones</b> in a well producing under steady state conditions were run. <b>Fishbones</b> was found to increase production by up to 60 % compared to an unstimulated well, depending on spacing between the <b>Fishbones</b> laterals. The increase in production from a well with <b>Fishbones</b> also depend on the <b>Fishbones</b> lateral length. Doubling the <b>Fishbones</b> lateral length increased production rate by 80 % compared to an unstimulated. Long needles with long spacing was found to give a higher increase in production compared to an unstimulated well than short needles with short spacing. Cases with <b>Fishbones</b> in a well that had severe damage in the near wellbore area showed that <b>Fishbones</b> was able to remove {{the effect of the}} damage and in some cases even increase the production above that of an unstimulated and undamaged well. <b>Fishbones</b> also increased production in formations with a low kv/kh compared to an unstimulated well. <b>Fishbones</b> was also capable of penetrating impermeable layers close to the well and improving communication throughout the reservoir. Upscaling using an apparent wellbore radius was also investigated. An apparent wellbore radius was found to be able to match the production rate and flowing bottom hole pressure (depending on well control) from a well with <b>Fishbones</b> in all flow conditions...|$|R
