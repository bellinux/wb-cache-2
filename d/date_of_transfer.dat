500|$|The date of {{construction}} {{of the church is}} uncertain, but it is a medieval building, probably from the 15th century. The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones thought that the church was probably 16th-century in date, but might have been built using material from an older structure. The historian Antony Carr has suggested that Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd was the church dedicated to St Mary that was sacked by Normans in 1157. [...] St Mary's was formerly one of the chapels of ease to St Nidan's, Llanidan, along with St Deiniol's, Llanddaniel Fab and St Edwen's, Llanedwen. [...] St Nidan's and its chapels were owned by the Augustinian priory at Beddgelert, Gwynedd; the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> is uncertain, since not all the records have survived, but St Nidan's is mentioned as belonging to the priory in a charter of 1360. [...] Carr has written that [...] "we shall never know" [...] how the [...] "distant community" [...] in Beddgelert came to possess the four Anglesey churches, but thought that it might be significant that the priory also controlled two churches on the mainland, {{on the other side of}} the Menai Strait.|$|E
