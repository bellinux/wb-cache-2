40|$|Pequi is an {{oleaginous}} fruit whose edible oil is composed mainly by saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The biological and nutritional properties of pequi oil {{are dependent on}} its composition, which can change according to the oil source (pulp or kernel). There is little data in the scientific literature concerning {{the differences between the}} compositions of pequi <b>kernel</b> and pulp <b>oils.</b> Therefore, in this study, different pequi genotypes were evaluated to determine the fatty acid composition of pulp and <b>kernel</b> <b>oils.</b> PCA and PLS-DA were applied to develop a model to distinguish these oils. For all evaluated genotypes, the major fatty acids of both pulp and <b>kernel</b> <b>oils</b> were oleic and palmitic acids.

The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats.
