About 93% of the state population depend directly upon agriculture.The main cereals grown in the state are wheat, maize, rice and barley.

There are huge tracts of land suitable only for growing fruits. Fruit of all cultivation does not add to the problem of soil erosion and its employment potential is more than the conventional farming. The yield per acre in terms of income is also much higher. [...] Apple produces the maximum income. Fruit growing in the state is fetching over Rs. 3billion annually. Special efforts are being made to promote cultivation of crops like olives, figs, hops, mushrooms, flowers, pistachio nuts, sarda melon and saffron.

Economic analysis has been carried out in a representative case study located in the Sicilian northwestern coast, considering an orchard economic life equal to 50 years. Results, which referred to one hectare area, showed both a higher economic and financial sustainability of organic farming respect to conventional farming. The higher profitability of organic farming was due to minor labor requirement and to greater market appreciation for organic products that granted a premium price respect to conventional prices. Moreover, greater profitability of organic farming and use of environmentally friendly inputs in production process make farms competitive and eco-friendly...|$|R

50|$|In 1990 grain {{production}} dominated Polish agriculture: {{the highest}} yields came from wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Other major crops included potatoes, sugar beet, fodder crops, flax, hops, tobacco, and <b>fruits.</b> <b>Cultivation</b> of corn (maize) expanded during the 1980s but remained limited. The northern and east-central {{regions of the}} country mainly offered poorer sandy soils suitable for rye and potatoes. The richer soils of the central and southern parts of the country, excluding those at higher elevations, made those regions the centers of wheat, sugar beet, hops, and tobacco production. The more accessible land at higher elevations was used to cultivate oats or was left as meadow and pastureland. In 1989 almost half of Poland's arable land was used for the cultivation of the four major grains, another 13 percent grew potatoes.

40|$|Recently, {{the markets}} {{globalization}} process {{has become increasingly}} intense leading to markets' hanges and a growth competition between companies operating on the international market. The agrifood sector among others has undergone several transformation characterized by the diffusion of modern New Technology, Information and Communication, the harmonization of regulations, and the reduction of technical barriers (Banterle and Olper, 2007). These last two changes were made due to the commercial bilateral signature or multilateral agreements. These changes have forced companies to rethink their strategies and organizational management. The Italian international agribusiness scenario plays an importance role. Many Italian agro-food products, such as wine, olive oil, bakery and confectionery industry, are nowadays well known and appreciated {{all over the world}} creating a business of considerable interest. The last years, there has been a growth interest in Italy for the small <b>fruits</b> <b>cultivation</b> because of their nutraceutical importance, the wide margins of income and the social-plane-employment. The small <b>fruits</b> <b>cultivation,</b> mainly prevalent in northern Italy, has shown a growth in recent years both in terms of area and production. This was encouraged by a growing demand of products designed {{to meet the needs of}} the confectionery industry. In fact, according to the ISTAT (2013) analysis of trade, the growth rate of imports is more sustained than the exports one. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the Italy competitive position in the small fruits international market based on the recent growth of the sector and the opportunities it’s able to offer. In particular, we will study the competitiveness of Italy and other countries that have an important place at the international level in terms of production and trade using indicators widely used in the international trade literature analysis. The analysis will be based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics concerning the small fruits production. The results of the research show the role of Italy competitiveness in the international market in one hand; and the main supply markets by type of product in another hand. Finally, the future scenarios on agricultural policies implemented recently to support the Small fruits sector in the different Italian regions are formulated...|$|R
