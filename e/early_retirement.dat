40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} labor market developments of the last century was the sustained trend toward <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement</b> among American men. This trend came to at least a temporary halt in the mid- 1980 s. Since then, male participation rates at older ages have stabilized or even increased slightly, while older women’s participation rates have begun rising dramatically. The dominant factor driving the trend toward <b>earlier</b> male <b>retirement</b> was a long-term increase in economic wealth, which permitted workers to enjoy rising living standards even as they spent a growing percentage of their lives outside the workforce. The expansion of Social Security and of employer-sponsored pension plans, and the introduction of mandatory retirement rules, also encouraged <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement</b> over much of the last century...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} decrease {{in the labor force}} participation of older men remains a puzzle, despite many studies that have analyzed the role of Social Security and pension incentives. This paper examines whether the population trends of rising labor force participation among women and <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement</b> among men are present at the household level. The results indicate that a husband’s retirement hazard increases with the accumulated value of his wife’s career earnings. Simulations suggest that the increase in married women’s earnings from 1965 to 2000 could account for approximately 17 percent of the <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement</b> experienced by men during this period...|$|R

5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led to an <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been {{closing in on the}} leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E
2500|$|Greater wealth {{tends to}} lead to <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement,</b> since wealthier {{individuals}} can essentially [...] "purchase" [...] additional leisure. Generally the effect of wealth on retirement is difficult to estimate empirically since observing greater wealth at older ages {{may be the result}} of increased saving over the working life in anticipation of <b>earlier</b> <b>retirement.</b> However, a number of economists have found creative ways to estimate wealth effects on retirement and typically find that they are small. For example, one paper exploits the receipt of an inheritance to measure the effect of wealth shocks on retirement using data from the HRS. The authors find that receiving an inheritance increases the probability of retiring earlier than expected by 4.4 percentage points, or 12 percent relative to the baseline retirement rate, over an eight-year period.|$|R

In the late 1940s, his health declined and he was unable to continue running such a large hotel and, after running a smaller pub, he was forced into <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in the 1950s. After a long illness, he died on 29 August 1958 at the age of 60 in the village of Sychdyn. He was buried in Everton Cemetery in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Horrocks {{commanded}} a battalion during the Battle of France, {{the first time}} he served under Bernard Montgomery, the most prominent British commander of the war. Montgomery later identified Horrocks as one of his most able officers, appointing him to corps commands in both North Africa and Europe. In 1943, Horrocks was seriously wounded and took more than a year to recover before returning to command a corps in Europe. It is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion; his contemporary corps commanders in North Africa, Oliver Leese and Miles Dempsey, went on to command at army level and above. Horrocks' wound caused continuing health problems and led to his <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> from the army after the war.|$|E

One such dispute, a consequence of the Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in 1809.

5|$|The series {{features}} {{the exploits of}} Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind. The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border. Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of the new century, Ravel made five {{attempts}} to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.|$|E

He served on a board chaired by Fleet Admiral Halsey which also included Admirals Spruance, Towers and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, whose task was to nominate 50 of the 215 serving rear admirals for <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> Kinkaid was soon facing this fate himself, when the House Armed Services Committee sought {{to reduce the number of}} four-star rank officers in 1947. Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, who would have to retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid's retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through New York City, were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.|$|E
