Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> the factory.

30|$|In {{addition}} to {{finding a job}} within one’s occupational domain, a key indicator of graduates’ labour market position is whether the <b>job</b> is <b>at</b> {{the level of the}} education programme completed (i.e. the job is on one’s own level).

The percentage of graduates with a <b>job</b> <b>at</b> their level is very high, more than 82.1  %. The percentages of graduates with a <b>job</b> <b>at</b> their level in the education sectors of health care and behaviour and society are even higher, at 93.0 and 88.9  %, respectively.
