500|$|From trials {{carried out}} by a {{commercial}} Nepenthes nursery, it appears that micronutrient solutions have [...] "a beneficial effect on plants of improved leaf colouration, with no deleterious effects" [...] as far as can be seen. However, more research is required to verify these results. Actual <b>fertilisers</b> (<b>containing</b> NPK) were, on the other hand, found to [...] "cause damage to plants, promote pathogens and have no observable benefits". Hence, the use of chemical fertilisers is usually not advised.|$|R
50|$|Phosphorus is {{required}} by all plants but is limited in soil, creating a problem in agriculture. In many areas phosphorus must be added to soil for the extensive plant growth that is desired for crop production. Phosphorus was first added as a fertilizer {{in the form of}} single super phosphate (SSP) in the mid-nineteenth century, following research at Rothamsted Experimental Station in England. SSP is non-nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>containing</b> Phosphate in the form of monocalcium phosphate and Gypsum which is best suited for Alkali soils to supplement Phosphate and reduce soil alkalinity.|$|R
40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) {{has become}} a major crop grown in {{rotation}} with spring wheat and lupins in Western Australia (WA) since the mid 1990 s. Most soils in WA are highly weathered with very low levels of phosphorus (P). The WA soils initially contained adequate indigenous soil potassium (K) for cropping but removal of K over time in the harvested grains has gradually resulted in the some soils becoming deficient in K for grain production. The sulphur (S) status of WA soils was maintained when single superphosphate (containing about 11 per cent S) was widely used as P fertiliser. The increased and widespread use of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> lower S levels than single superphosphate, such as DAP and MAP is likely to increase S deficiency in canola. Furthermore, S deficiency has more frequently been identified in canola crops (compared with wheat and lupins). Consequently <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> P, K and S are now applied to most canola crops. Fertiliser costs represent {{a significant part of the}} variable costs of growing crops in WA. Chen et al. (2009) identified the need for improved soil test interpretation for making fertiliser recommendations due to substantial changes in farming systems, fertiliser practices and crop yield potential since earlier calibrations were developed. The aims of this study were (1) to compile experimental data containing the standard soil test measurements and observed canola crop yield responses for both nil and fertilised treatments across different soil types and seasons from published or unpublished sources, and (2) to critically analyse soil test-crop response relationships to derive better critical soil test values in soils and environments suitable for canola grain production in WA...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on {{evaluating}} the impact of fertilization of spring barley by organic and mineral fertilizers, and comparing their effects on yield and quality. The literature search sought to determine spring barley requirements for environmental factors, nutrition and fertilization, and to determine cultivation problems, such as lodging, pests and disease. As an experiment included in my thesis, I conducted the long-term field study on plant nutrition, being performed since autumn 1996 at the Department of Agro-environmental Chemistry. In this study, three crops rotate in the following order: potatoes, winter wheat, spring barely. In the area of Červený Újezd the corn is used instead of potatoes, due to the agrotechnical reasons. The study took place at five areas (Suchdol, Červený Újezd, Humpolec, Lukavec, Hněvčeves). These are areas with different soil and climatic conditions, which are {{used to assess the}} influence of habitat. The experiment was conducted under several controlled conditions. The Control area was left fertilizer-free. The variant Manure involved organic fertilization with the potato-intended manure, with estimated dosage of 330 kg N/ha. Variant Kal was also fertilized with potato-intended manure, with the same amount of nitrogen as variant Manure. Variant Manure 1 / 2 + N was organically fertilized by the manure at a dose of 165 kg N / ha and subsequently fertilized for spring barley at a dose 55 kg N / ha in the form of ammonium nitrate with limestone (ANL). Variant N received only mineral fertilization 70 kg N/ha with ANL. In the Variant NPK, only mineral fertilizers were used (ANL, triple superphosphate, potassium salt) with the total dosage 70 kg N/ha, 30 kg P/ha, 100 kg K/ha. Variant N+straw was fertilized with 70 kg/ha of mineral nitrogen and a straw was always plowed after harvesting spring barley. The results clearly show that Červený Újezd is the most suitable area for the cultivation of spring barely. This experiment also confirmed substantial influence of fertilizer on the quality and yield of grain, as well as the influence of the habitat. NPK variant had the highest yield and quality in most locations, hence a variant with mineral fertilizers <b>containing</b> <b>three</b> basic <b>nutrients.</b> From the economical view, Control variant only was evaluated. Profitable production was reached only at sites Suchdol and Červený Újezd...|$|R

2500|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} plant nutrient (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture <b>fertilisers,</b> <b>containing</b> as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. Its annual demand is rising nearly {{twice as fast as}} the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow. [...] Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.|$|R

40|$|Micronutrient disorders, {{especially}} B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, {{have been}} recorded for eucalypts in nearly all the geographical regions where commercial plantations have been established. Whilst micronutrient disorders are often induced by the application of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> only macronutrients, instances of primary B deficiency in China and Cu deficiency in Australia have been recently documented. Increasing records of micronutrient disorders in plantation eucalypts suggests that the capacity of micronutrients to limit productivity has not been adequately recognised in the past. Dramatic growth responses can occur with corrective fertilisation particularly where a micronutrient deficiency has been debilitating for growth. However, where deficiencies of elements have resulted in severe crown dieback and loss of form, {{it is very difficult}} to restart growth with good form. This paper describes the visual impact of micronutrient disorders on eucalypts in plantations, their effect on wood production and wood quality, and explores strategies for micronutrient management...|$|R
