40|$|Conventional correlation-based frame {{synchronization}} techniques can suffer significant performance degradation over multi-path frequency-selective channels. As a remedy, {{in this paper}} we consider <b>joint</b> <b>frame</b> synchronization and channel estimation. This, however, increases the length of the resulting combined channel and its estimation becomes more challenging. On the other hand, since the combined channel is a sparse vector, sparse channel estimation methods can be applied. We propose a <b>joint</b> <b>frame</b> synchronization and channel estimation method using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm which exploits the sparsity of the combined channel vector. Subsequently, the channel estimate is used to design the equalizer.

40|$|The current {{emphasis}} on social responsibility and community collaboration within higher education {{has led to}} an increased drive to include service learning in the curriculum. With its {{emphasis on}} mutually beneficial collaborations, service learning can be meaningful for both students and the community, but is challenging to manage successfully. From a design education perspective, {{it is interesting to note}} that contemporary design practice emphasises a similar approach known as a human-centered design, where users are considered and included throughout the design process. In considering both service learning and human-centered design as foundations for design pedagogy, various philosophical and methodological similarities are evident. The paper explores the relationship between a service learning community engagement approach and a human-centered design approach in contemporary communication design education. To this end, each approach is considered individually after which a <b>joint</b> <b>frame</b> of reference is presented. Butin’s service learning typology, namely the four Rs – respect, reciprocity, relevance and reflection – serves as a point of departure for the <b>joint</b> <b>frame</b> of reference.

A receiver, based on the EM algorithm, is derived. This receiver iterates between detection and estimation.

Through computer simulations the performance of the proposed receiver is investigated, both in terms of frame error rate (FER) and estimation error variance. We show that exploiting code properties for estimation purposes allows to reduce the length of training sequences, and thus results in an increase in spectral efficiency. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on damage {{mechanics}} and failure model, a seismic damage model applying to steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> is put forward, which takes deformation and cumulative damage into account. The damage performance of five tentative <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> is compared and analyzed according to deformation and dissipated hysteretic energy under different loading levels, {{and the main}} influence factors on damage performance are established. The damage indexes of tentative <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> are calculated, {{and the influence of}} strength grade of concrete and axial compression ratio on damage performance is discussed. The results indicate that the general damage is controlled by the damage of concrete in the earlier stage of loading, and by the damage of shape steel and stirrup in the later stage of loading; joints with lower axial compression ratio and lower concrete strength grade possess better hysteretic energy performance. Damage analysis provides an available means for the research of steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> under seismic load. The damage model presented can be a reference for seismic damage analysis of the structure, prediction of earthquake damage in future, estimation of economic loss and repair after earthquake...|$|R

The seismic performance of precast concrete structure very much depends on the ductility of the <b>joints</b> <b>framed</b> by precast beams and columns. It has been understood that (1) moment resistance beam-column connection and (2) ductile connectors seems to be the most widely used in the precast construction in seismic regions.
