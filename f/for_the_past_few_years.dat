500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where it all began.

500|$|NXT Arrival {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Aaron Oster of the Baltimore Sun described the event as fantastic, but [...] "marred by technical issues".

Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival [...] "was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE a chance to show off the NXT roster". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match [...] "wasn't the same as their previous encounters, and they actually built on it" [...] and that [...] "they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it [...] "was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves." [...] He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant [...] "Better than Batista". For the main event, Oster felt that there were [...] "some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match", so it was not [...] "overly special" [...] but still [...] "pretty good". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who [...] "worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE should really consider going back to this format for the main shows".|$|E

Catucci called the songs [...] "speedy, neatly packaged reinterpretations of pop-rock history, from the Beatles to Creedence Clearwater Revival to the Ramones themselves". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it [...] "gleeful, unabashed fun" [...] and complimented Green Day for [...] "embracing their fondness for pop and making the best damn album they'd ever made". Erlewine expressed that the band displays [...] "melodic ingenuity and imaginative arrangements" [...] and elaborated on its musical significance, stating [...] "Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, doing it all without a trace of self-consciousness. It's the first great pure pop album of the new millennium". Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine cited it as [...] "the most influential album on the British pop landscape since 1996 (Spice, naturally)", noting it as a significant influence on [...] "the two biggest bands in the UK at the moment, and indeed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Busted and McFly". Passantino called Warning [...] "a great album" [...] and viewed that Green Day [...] "seemed to be bored with their genre-medium, but simultaneously knowledgeable that any attempt to boundary-hop will end with them falling on their face".|$|E
