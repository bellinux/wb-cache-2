6000|$|... "How {{about all}} those trees he cuts down? If that isn't destroying, I don't know what is!" [...] said Chatterer, and with each word <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> as if somehow his tongue and tail were connected.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not a pig! I {{found these}} nuts first and I tell you they're mine!" [...] shrieked Happy Jack, {{so angry that}} every time he spoke he <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail.</b> And {{all the time he}} was chasing round and round the trunk of the tree trying to prevent Chatterer getting up.|$|E
60|$|Chatterer could contain himself no longer. His tongue fairly flew and he <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> so {{hard and}} so fast that Peter Rabbit almost {{expected}} to see him break it right off. He called Happy Jack names, all the bad names he could think of, and worked himself up into such a rage that it was some time before Old Mother Nature could quiet him.|$|E
6000|$|Chebec nodded. [...] "I'm the smallest," [...] said he. [...] "That's {{why they}} call me Least Flycatcher. I may be least in size, but I can tell you one thing, Peter Rabbit, {{and that is that}} I can catch just as many bugs and flies as any of them." [...] Suiting action to the word, he darted out into the air. His little bill snapped and with a quick turn he was back on <b>his</b> former perch, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> and uttering <b>his</b> sharp little cry of, [...] "Chebec! Chebec! Chebec!" [...] until Peter began to wonder which he was the most fond of, {{catching}} flies, or the sound of his own voice.|$|R
6000|$|Happy Jack {{turned his}} back to Chatterer and continued, [...] "He doesn't seem to mind cold weather at all, {{as long as the}} sun shines. His noisy tongue is to be heard on the coldest days of winter. He is the sauciest, most impudent fellow of the Green Forest, and never so happy as when he is making trouble for others. He sauces and scolds {{everybody}} he meets, and every time he opens <b>his</b> mouth he <b>jerks</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail.</b> He's quarrelsome. Worse than that, in the spring when the birds are nesting, he turns robber. He goes hunting for nests and steals the eggs, and what is even more dreadful, he kills and eats the baby birds. All the birds hate him, and I don't blame them." ...|$|R
50|$|The Senegal batis {{maintains}} a territory {{throughout the year}} which the male patrols daily, sitting on high open perches and singing. The territory is shared with the female and with any immatures from the previous years, and they are sometimes seen in family groups. If intruders are seen then the male undertakes and aggressive display which involves an upright stance with the bill held vertically, the breast and crown feather fluffed out, swinging his rear end while <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail.</b> In flight the aggressive display is a bouncing flight with the bill held up and the crown and rump fluffed out. It will also aggressively mob shrikes, especially the Brubru with bill snapping and wing fripping but uses different behaviour when mobbing hornbills, cuckoos and pearl-spotted owlets or snakes. When mobbing the owlet it crouches, raises its head and shoulders and flicks its tail, the snakes are mobbed by hovering, rattling calls and bill snapping.|$|R
60|$|So Happy Jack sat {{outside on}} {{a branch of the}} hollow tree where his old {{storehouse}} was and scolded, and called Unc' Billy Possum names, and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> angrily with every word he said. And Unc' Billy Possum sat {{in the doorway of the}} hollow tree and showed his teeth to Happy Jack and said unpleasant things. It really was very dreadful the way those two did talk.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} one that greeted me, the first living {{thing in the}} great woods, as I ran my canoe ashore on a wilderness river. Meeko heard me coming. His bark sounded loudly, in a big spruce, above the dip of the paddles. As we turned shoreward, he ran down the tree in which he was, and out on a fallen log to meet us. I grasped {{a branch of the}} old log to steady the canoe and watched him curiously. He had never seen a man before; he barked, jeered, scolded, <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail,</b> whistled, did everything within his power to make me show my teeth and my disposition.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps it {{was because}} Peter was {{thinking}} of him that almost the first voice he heard {{when he reached the}} Old Orchard was that of Chebec, repeating his own name over and over as if he loved the sound of it. It didn't take Peter long to find him. He was sitting out on the up of one of the upper branches of an apple-tree where he could watch for flies and other winged insects. He looked so much like Mr. Phoebe, save that he was smaller, that any one would have know they were cousins. [...] "Chebec! Chebec! Chebec!" [...] he repeated over and over, and with every note <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail.</b> Now and then he would dart out into the air and snap up something so small that Peter, looking up from the ground, couldn't see it at all.|$|E
6000|$|I slid {{lower in}} the canoe till only my head and {{shoulders}} were visible. Mooween went nosing along-shore till something--a dead fish or a mussel bed--touched his appetite, when he stopped and began feeding, scarcely two hundred yards away. I reached first for my heavy rifle, then for the paddle, and cautiously [...] "fanned" [...] the canoe towards shore till an old stump on the point covered my approach. Then the little bark jumped forward as if alive. But I had scarcely started when--klrrrr! klrrr! ik-ik--ik! Over my head swept Koskomenos with a rush of wings and an alarm cry that spoke only of haste and danger. I had {{a glimpse of the}} bear as he shot into the alders, as if thrown by a catapult; the kingfisher wheeled in a great rattling circle about the canoe before he pitched upon the old stump, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> and clattering in great excitement.|$|R
60|$|After frisking about {{he would}} stop to rest. Then he would sit up very {{straight}} and fold his hands across his breast, where they would get nice and warm in the fur of his coat. His beautiful, great gray tail would be arched up over his back. His bright eyes would snap and twinkle, {{and then he would}} shout just for joy, and every time he shouted he <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> big <b>tail.</b> Farmer Brown's boy called it barking, but it was Happy Jack's way of shouting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{came into}} full view, {{and in the}} dim light, as they stood chest on, they {{appeared}} as huge as the strange beasts of the Arabian tales. I aimed at the lioness which stood nearest to me and fired. Without a sound, like a bullock felled at one blow, she dropped. The lion gave vent to a sonorous roar. Hastily I slipped another cartridge in my rifle. Then I became conscious {{that he had seen}} me. He lowered his head, and his crest was erect. <b>His</b> lifted <b>tail</b> was twitching, <b>his</b> lips were drawn back from the red gums, and I saw his great white fangs. Living fire flashed from his eyes, and he growled incessantly. Then he advanced a few steps, his head held low; and his eyes were fixed on mine with a look of rage. Suddenly he <b>jerked</b> up <b>his</b> <b>tail,</b> and when a lion does this he charges. I got a quick sight on his chest and fired. He reared up on his hind legs, roaring loudly and clawing at the air, and fell back dead. One lioness remained, and through the smoke I saw her spring to her feet and rush towards me. Escape was impossible, for behind me were high boulders that I could not climb. She came on with hoarse, coughing grunts, and with desperate courage I fired my remaining barrel. I missed her clean. I took one step backwards in the hope of getting a cartridge into my rifle, and fell, scarcely two lengths in front of the furious beast. She missed me. I owed my safety to that fall. And then suddenly I found that she had collapsed. I had hit her after all. My bullet went clean through her heart, but the spring had carried her forwards. When I scrambled to my feet I found that she was dying. I walked back to my camp and ate a capital breakfast.' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{elbow to}} the south-east--the {{direction}} of the Quiet Woman.|$|R
60|$|The Sheik <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb toward Ali ben Kadin and {{addressed}} Meriem.|$|R
60|$|The {{gardener}} <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head {{towards a}} window on the ground floor.|$|R
60|$|Next moment Mr. Jones <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head up, glaring with sardonic fury.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} a violent leap of Pan's blood. It <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> whole frame.|$|R
60|$|Lawford <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> candle as if towards some {{definite}} goal. 'In time,' he said.|$|R
60|$|Newman <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head {{towards his}} little room, to signify {{that she was}} waiting there.|$|R
60|$|With a curse the man <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> leg clear, Michael's teeth {{ribboning}} {{flesh and}} trousers.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Negget made no reply, {{but in a}} cowardly fashion <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb {{toward his}} wife.|$|R
50|$|The male {{displays}} by grasping a stem {{of grass}} at one end, and hops or files to near the female. At once he sleeks down his feathers, stands upright with tail straight down, and <b>jerks</b> <b>his</b> head upwards a few times. He then leans forward, twists <b>his</b> <b>tail</b> towards the female and fluffs his flank and belly feathers. At this stage he usually drops the straw {{and begins to}} sing and dance. The flank and ventral feathers are not always fluffed out, {{and the intensity of}} the display probably depends on the relationship of the two birds. If the female seems receptive the male will attempt copulation. However, most displays come to an end before this final phase is reached. Successful mating is usually followed by a little bill fencing and mutual preening (Baptista and Horblit 1990).|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{meant it}} then?' Mullins <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head delicately towards the ground-ash on the table. 'I heard {{something}} about it.' ...|$|R
60|$|RUFIO. Ay. I {{have brought}} him with me. He is waiting there (<b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> thumb over his shoulder) under guard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{enjoy the}} sunlight--the atmosphere--I go along this path, through that gate"--he <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head over his shoulder--"and round--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Moss paused, {{with his}} glass halfway to <b>his</b> lips. He <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{head in the}} {{direction}} of Mr. Parker.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} Brute {{emerged from his}} fortifications and, {{removing}} his pipe from <b>his</b> mouth, <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> chair out into the open.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's 'er say, then?' {{asked the}} father {{secretly}} of Harry, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> {{head in the}} direction of the stairs whence Fanny had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{master of}} the other craft, {{holding on to the}} stays with one hand, <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> thumb expressively towards Miss Cringle, and waited.|$|R
60|$|Mr Toodle, {{who had a}} {{great respect}} for learning, <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head approvingly at his wife, and {{moistened}} his hands with dawning satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Goble <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> head {{so violently}} that the Derby hat flew off, {{to be picked}} up, dusted, and {{restored}} by the stage-director.|$|R
6000|$|How it {{was that}} I escaped being gored to death before I had {{finished}} my picture is more than I can explain to this day. [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] resented the very sight {{of me and my}} color-box, as if he viewed the taking of his likeness in the light of a personal insult. It required two men to coax him, while a third held him by a ring in his nostrils, before I could venture on beginning to work. Even then he always lashed <b>his</b> <b>tail,</b> and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> huge head, and rolled his fiery eyes with a devouring anxiety to have me on his horns for daring to sit down quietly and look at him. Never, I can honestly say, did I feel more heartily grateful for the blessings of soundness of limb and wholeness of skin, than when I had completed the picture of the bull! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allemachter!" [...] he said, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> pony round. [...] "It's you, Missie Jess, is it? Now {{who would}} have thought of seeing you here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was in my}} old regiment," [...] said Foxy, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> head {{towards the}} notices, where a {{newspaper}} cutting was thumb-tacked between call-over lists.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{the query}} was to Slone like a blow. It brought {{his head up}} with a <b>jerk,</b> <b>his</b> glance steady and keen on Bostil's.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> {{thumb in}} the {{direction}} of Miss Pilbeam and winked with slow deliberation. [...] "She'll be there, too," [...] he added. [...] "Savvy?" ...|$|R
