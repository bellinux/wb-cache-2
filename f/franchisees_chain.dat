These hypotheses are tested in the French franchising context by using a sample of 138 franchisors. The empirical results are largely supportive of the hypotheses.

40|$|International audiencePurpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{independent}} small business owners’ perceptions of franchisees relationships with their franchisors, their fellow <b>franchisees</b> within the <b>chain,</b> their employees and their customers. Design/methodology/approach– The authors use a qualitative approach and, more specifically, 26 in-depth interviews conducted with independent small business owners from various business sectors. Findings– These independent small business owners perceive that franchisees have a dependency-based relationship with their franchisors; a competition-based relationship with their fellow franchisees; a rather complicated relationship with their employees; and a superficial relationship with their customers. Research limitations/implications– This study contributes to the franchising literature by presenting an outside-chain view of franchisees’ relationships with their franchisors, other franchisees, employees and customers. Practical implications– The findings may have practical implications for franchisors, enabling them to better understand the concerns of independent small business owners as potential franchisee candidates. Originality/value– The outside-chain view of franchisees’ relationships is innovative...|$|R
40|$|Franchises are {{peculiar}} in two ways: first, {{the authority}} of franchisees is largely informal rather than formal. The efficiency of franchises is often attributed to their initiative and autonomy. Yet, in franchise contracts, franchisees agree {{to submit to the}} sometimes arbitrary will of the <b>chain.</b> Second, a <b>franchisee</b> pays her <b>chain</b> a royalty based on revenues that are not depended on costs, despite such an arrangement creating distorted incentives for the chain. Why? One possible answer is the noncontrability of costs. Yet costs are contracted on in many economic relationships, so why not in this institution? This paper attempts to answer this question by relating the royalty scheme to the existence of informal authority. Although costs in theory might be contractible, in reality contractibility would require the gathering of information that would create incentives for a chain to interfere with franchisee actions, thus undermining innovative behaviour and reducing efficiency. franchising, innovation, organisations, contractibility, incentives...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} and social contribution of franchising is widely reported. However, little research has examined the factors influencing {{the achievement of the}} four franchising imperatives (i. e., unit growth, uniformity, local responsiveness and system-wide adaptation). Based on the seminal work of Bradach (1995), the four franchising imperatives were found to be key elements driving franchise success. This paper will explore the four franchising imperatives within the context of multiple-unit franchising. This represents and important gap in the organizational choice literature. The purpose of this research was to identify those factors which may enable or hinder the achievement of the four franchising imperatives in plural franchising arrangements. An exploratory convergent interviewing approach was used to collect data from a sample of 16 respondents. A series of eight propositions derived from the qualitative stage of this research are presented for later quantitative testing. The results suggest that the four franchising imperatives are best achieved through the provision of rewards systems and business growth models, professional development training, timely communication with head office staff, and allowing informal flexibility beyond contract provisions. Key factors that may hinder the achievement the four imperatives include a lack of franchisor-initiated innovation and <b>chain</b> <b>franchisee</b> decision-making involvement, franchisee personality and costs of compliance.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirical {{issues of}} pricing and price dispersion within franchised restaurant and fast-food chains. Given the per se illegality of {{resale price maintenance}} (RPM) under current U. S. Antitrust laws, {{and the fact that}} franchised outlets are independent businesses under the law, franchisors must delegate the power to set prices to <b>franchisees</b> whereas corporate <b>chains</b> can control downstream prices directly. The issue I examine is whether it matters empirically who, between the franchisor or the franchisee, gets to choose downstream prices, and why. After discussing a number of reasons why prices chosen by franchisees may differ from those that a franchisor would pick, I show, using data from all restaurant chains in the metropolitan Pittsburgh and Detroit areas, that there is price dispersion in fast-food franchising. I then show that the amount of price dispersion relates to the amount of franchising in a way that suggests that 1) franchisors are not able to control franchisees' prices indirectly to the same extent that they control company-owned unit prices and 2) the prices in franchised and corporate units are systematically different. Finally, I show that prices are systematically lower in corporate restaurants. This suggests that the reason behind the price differentials is not franchisor opportunism, but more likely double marginalization or, potentially, the existence of positive horizontal externalities among restaurants in a chain. ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this PhD dissertation is to investigate management control aspects of franchising chains that are characterized by different levels of service customization. In chapter one, we {{provide an overview of}} the recent literature on franchising, with special attention to management control issues. Based on an analysis of franchising articles published in twenty-five high-impact journals over the period 1996  2008, the literature is divided into the following three broad streams: franchise initiation and subsequent propensity to franchise, franchise performance and control of franchising relationships. Several research gaps and avenues for future research are identified, especially towards a systematic study of management control issues in the context of franchising relationships. In chapter two, we investigate management control system (MCS) design in service organizations that are characterized by varying levels of customization. Based on a comparative case study in four franchising chains offering various degrees of standardized versus customized services, we find substantial differences in the use and nature of outcome, behavior and social control. Financial outcome controlis used to a high extent in all cases, but is more tight in case of higher customization. Nonfinancial outcome control is also used to a high extent in all cases, but it is more subjective in case of higher customization. A particular type of behavior control, which we call interventionbehavior control, is used to a higher extent in case of lower customization. The use of non-intervention types of behavior control is unrelatedto the degree of customization. Finally, social control is used to a higher extent in service organizations offering more customized services. We conclude that this study shows the need to refine the generic outcomeand behavior control concepts in order to improve predictions concerning their use under various conditions of service customization. Based upon our case study findings we formulate propositions concerning the use of different types of control and provide insights into why organizationsinstall particular control structures in case of lower versus higher customization. The aim of chapter three is to investigate how service customization impacts on the way in which franchisors controlthe relationship with their franchised service units. We particularly investigate variation in franchise contract design in terms of the delegation of decision rights, monitoring, incentives and input control in chains offering services with varying levels of customization. We code and analyze a unique sample of 81 contracts of chains from different serviceindustries. The results of our empirical analyses show that there existimportant differences in the contractual control system dependent on the level of service customization. Franchisors of chains offering highly customized services delegate more decision rights to their service units, but include higher monetary incentives and more input control items assafeguards in their contracts. Regarding outcome monitoring, we observe no difference in the use of financial outcome monitoring across chains with different levels of service customization. Nevertheless, higher customization is associated with a higher use of subjective nonfinancial outcome monitoring, whereas objective nonfinancial outcome monitoring is used to a higher extent when services are more standardized. In chains offering standardized services, franchisors make higher use of behavior monitoring. Supplementary analyses point to complementary as well as substitutive relationships among the contractual control items in franchising contracts of chains with different degrees of service customization. Chapter four explores the choice for franchisingversus company-ownership in relation to franchisors management controlproblems based on comparative case studies of 14 franchising chains with varying levels of service customization. The prior franchising literature on the plural form tends to narrow down the choice between franchising and company-ownership to a choice between different incentive schemes, which are associated with different types of control problems for the franchisor. However, since incentive schemes are only a part of the management control system, we argue that the residual control problems in both types of relationships are not properly accounted for in the extant literature. In this paper, we take a broader management control perspective to explain the use of franchising. In chains offering highly standardized services, we identify the costs of enforcing standards in the relationship with franchisees as an important driver of the preference for franchising or company-ownership. Franchising chains offering standardizedservices and experiencing rather low costs of standard enforcement as well as chains offering customized services prefer working with franchisees, however each for different reasons. By contrast, when standards are costly to enforce in the relationship with <b>franchisees,</b> <b>chains</b> offering standardized services prefer operating company-owned units to have more control over the chains uniformity and image and mainly franchise to deal with problems related to particular unit locations. Overall, we provide insights into potential causes of differential costs of enforcing standards in the relationship with franchisees and conclude that the pluralform as a control device functions differently depending on the size ofthese costs despite similarities in the level of service customization. status: publishe...|$|R
