40|$|Objective: Previous {{research}} using electropalatography (EPG) identified a compensatory <b>articulation</b> called bilabial-lingual <b>double</b> <b>articulations.</b> These <b>double</b> <b>articulations</b> were produced for bilabials by some speakers with cleft palate and involved closure at the lips occurring simultaneously with complete tongue-palate constriction. However, no normative English EPG data exist {{to confirm the}} abnormal status of these <b>double</b> <b>articulations.</b> Design: This study reports normative data for EPG contact during bilabial closure. Acoustic and EPG data were recorded for bilabials in different vowel contexts. Participants: Eight normal English-speaking adults. Measures: One measure identified complete tongue-palate constriction, and a second measure calculated percent contact. Results: There were no instances of complete tongue-palate constriction, though some EPG contact occurred in the lateral regions of the palate. The vowel context significantly affected the amount of contact present, with /i/ having the most and /a/ having {{the least amount of}} contact. Conclusion: Complete tongue-palate constriction during bilabials of the type found in bilabial-lingual <b>double</b> <b>articulations</b> is not a feature of normal English speech and can therefore be considered an abnormal articulation pattern. Speech-language pathologists who use EPG in their clinical work should be aware that some lateral contact during bilabial closure i...|$|R

It appears that I have not correctly designated the several groups of vertebrae, {{for a great}} authority, Mr. W.K. Parker ('Transact. Zoolog. Soc.' volume 5 page 198) specifies 16 cervical, 4 dorsal, 15 lumbar, and 6 caudal vertebrae in this genus. But I have used the same terms in all the following descriptions.); but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that I am not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison {{of the total number}} of vertebrae in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of six caudal vertebrae, because the basal one is almost completely anchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the caudal vertebrae agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebrae are, as just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three skeletons in a fit state for examination, in five of them, namely, in two Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs, which, though small, were perfectly developed with a <b>double</b> <b>articulation.</b> The presence of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much importance, for all the cervical vertebrae bear representatives of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes, and makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra. The addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone, for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine, and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebrae (7/72. Macgillivray 'British Birds' volume 1 page 25.), we need feel no surprise at the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being, as it appears, variable.|$|E

Participants: Twenty-seven speakers aged 5 to 62 years (median 11 years) with compensatory speech errors associated with repaired cleft palate. Measures: The lingual component of LLDAs was identified using electropalatography (EPG). EPG data were recorded simultaneously with acoustic data. Fifteen bilabial targets (/p/, /b/, /m/) per participant were analyzed.

50|$|The {{vertebrae}} of ‘’Milleretta’’ have wide neural arches, a synapomorhy {{of their}} class, parareptilia. It had spines {{coming off the}} neural arches. Horizontally orientated zygopophyses are present, as well as prominent transverse processes. BP/1/2040’s adult vertebrae contrast those of the juvenile specimen only with its fused centrum and arch in the adult. The ribs are especially sturdy dorsally, along with caudad expansions that help overlap the next rib over posteriorly. These holocephalus ribs contain crenelations. The thick ribs give protection to the cavity, but decrease the amount of flexibility {{of the body and}} decrease swiftness. The sister taxon Eunotosaurus shares thick and overlapped ribs. The thick ribs however are not a synapomorphy of the two taxon, as the ribs’ thickness were acquired them differently. ‘’Milleretta’’ had plesiomorphic vertebrae and made its ribs wider by growing its bone out the shaft to airfoil-like section. In contrast with Eunotosaurus’ trunk vertebrae are stretched and the “T” shaped ribs with <b>double</b> <b>articulations.</b> Not only are the centrum and arch fused, but the pubes and ischia are also fused in its pelvic girdle.

40|$|For a {{model of}} speech {{production}} to be comprehensive it {{must be able to}} account for both disordered and normal speech. The study of disordered speech often relies on perceptual judgements which are not always accurate enough representations of the speech process for such models. Perceptual judgements often encourage categorical decisions such as alveolar versus velar plosive which may not reflect articulatory reality. Evidence from EPG studies has identified non categorical errors, for example, so-called "misdirected articulatory gestures" (MAGs) which appear to be characteristic of aphasic speech. These involve distinctive lingual/palatal contacts which often remain undetected auditorily. For example, analysis of EPG data reveals cases where a perceived alveolar plosive may in reality be a <b>double</b> alveolar/velar <b>articulation</b> due to the presence of a velar MAG.

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} Electropalatography (EPG) {{have shown that}} {{individuals}} with speech disorders sometimes produce articulation errors that affect bilabial targets, but currently there is limited normative data available. In this study, EPG and acoustic data were recorded during complex word final /sps/ clusters spoken by 20 normal adults. A total contact (TC) index measured amount of tongue-palate contact during clusters in words such as 'crisps'. Bilabial closure was inferred from the acoustic signal. The TC profiles indicated that normal adults hold their tongues in a steady /s/-like position throughout the cluster; most speakers (85 %, n= 17) had {{no significant difference in}} TC values during bilabial closure compared to flanking fricatives. The results are interpreted as showing that normal speakers produce <b>double</b> bilabial-alveolar <b>articulations</b> for /p/ in these clusters.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with {{cleft lip}} and palate (CLP) often {{continue}} to have problems producing clear speech long after the clefts have been surgically repaired, leading to educational and social disadvantage. Speech is of key importance in CLP from both a {{quality of life and}} surgical outcome perspective, yet assessment relies on subjective perceptual methods, namely phonetic transcription. This is particularly problematic in CLP where the range of error types is arguably far greater than for other speech sound disorders, leading to problems with reliability (Howard & Lohmander, 2011). Moreover, CLP speech is known to be vulnerable to imperceptible error types, such as <b>double</b> <b>articulations</b> which can only be understood with instrumental techniques. Incorrect transcription of these errors can result in misdiagnosis and subsequent inappropriate intervention which can lead to speech errors becoming deeply ingrained. Until now, the technique of choice (recommended by the UK professional body for Speech & Language Therapists) for assessing articulatory errors in CLP has been electropalatography, with a number of small n studies showing it to be a powerful technique for identifying imperceptible errors and treating them by using real-time EPG for biofeedback. However, EPG is expensive and logistically difficult to manage. In contrast, ultrasound is cheaper and arguably better equipped to image the posterior articulations (such as pharyngeals) which are common in CLP. This study will present an ultrasound assessment protocol for the assessment of CLP speech which is designed to dovetail with current assessment practices used in Europe. Methods: We will use UTI to both qualitatively and quantitatively identify errors in the speech of 40 children with CLP. Data will consist of materials from the CLEFTNET protocol: spontaneous counting, 10 repetitions of all consonants in /aCa/, sentences from GOS. SP. ASS. 98 (Sell, Harding & Grunwell, 1998) and 5 minimal sets contrasting common substitutions (e. g. “a ship, a sip, a chip”). Ultrasound data will be collected using a Sonospeech high-speed cineloop system at 80 fps over a 150 degree field of view. The ultrasound probe will be placed under the chin using a new lightweight stabilising head set. Analysis: Consonants will be annotated using Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA) software (Articulate Instruments, 2012), after which we will systematically analyse the data to identify each of Gibbon’s eight error types (Gibbon, 2004) using measures by Zharkova (2013, 2016) and Dawson, Tiede and Whalen (2016). Conclusions: Data collection is ongoing.

This substantial and profound three-movement work is Pulitzer Prize winning composer George Walker's first work for wind ensemble and is a milestone in wind composition {{at the turn of the}} millennium. This analysis considers Walker's sophisticated use of octatonic collections and their subsets. Walker uses the three transpositions of the octatonic scale as a harmonic framework for the work. Within this framework, specific subsets of the collection are used in traditional harmonic ways. A hierarchy of pitch sets is created, lending a "tonic" function characteristic to prevalent and specifically placed sonorities. Onto this "canvas" of octatonic harmonies, Walker "paints" specific motivic gestures. These motivic gesture monopolize specific intervallic relationships that are initially presented in the beginning of the work.

Partimos da teoria de Karl Marx sobre a colonização e da metodologia de análise institucional dos mercados proposta por Karl Polanyi, destacando também as interpretações de Florestan Fernandes e Caio Prado Jr. sobre o sentido histórico do desenvolvimento brasileiro, além de tomar como fonte de análise a crítica materialista-histórica conduzida com base nas obras de E.

A pesquisa releva os determinantes da integração da região do Vale do Itajaí na economia brasileira relacionados a expansão da economia mundial característica do século XIX e início do XX, demonstrando como as relações comerciais e políticas do período estavam voltadas à construção de instituições públicas capazes de constituir disposições jurídicas e políticas para a realização de transações que alimentavam o processo de dependência da economia local a investimentos externos e recursos públicos federais como meio de fomento à infraestrutura voltada ao comércio de importação e exportação, uma dupla articulação dependente sustentada pela exploração sistemática da força de trabalho dos migrantes nacionais e estrangeiros que formaram a população brasileira da região. Abstract : The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} institution of the market economy in the Itajaí Valley and its effects on local livelihoods, empowerment and productive state development from the nineteenth century. Our research is are based upon Marx's theory of colonization and methodology, the institutional analysis of markets proposed by Karl Polanyi, the interpretations of Florestan Fernandes and Caio Prado Jr. on the historical sense of Brazilian development and historical-materialist critique contribution by the work of E.
