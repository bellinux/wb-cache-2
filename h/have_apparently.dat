5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sam {{and their}} party {{return to the}} Wall after finding two frozen corpses. Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points {{out that there is}} no sign of decay on their corpses, even though they <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> been dead for weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns him to keep his {{commitment}} to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} wildling Osha, now {{a servant}} of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns {{her that if she}} had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E

25|$|All of {{the native}} Drosophila and Scaptomyza species in Hawaii <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands, {{probably}} 20 million years ago.

Although it would be possible for a single gravid female to colonise an island, it is {{more likely to have been}} a group from the same species.|$|E
25|$|When {{the text}} resumes, the companions <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> been in Crotona {{for some time}} (125). A maid named Chrysis flirts with Encolpius and brings to him her {{beautiful}} mistress Circe, who asks him for sex. However, his attempts are prevented by impotence (126–128). Circe and Encolpius exchange letters, and he seeks a cure by sleeping without Giton (129–130). When he next meets Circe, she brings with her an elderly enchantress called Proselenos who attempts a magical cure (131). Nonetheless, he fails again to make love, as Circe has Chrysis and him flogged (132).|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} Bahá’í {{execution}} apparently occurred in 1998, when the Iranian government hanged Ruhollah Rohani in Mashad on {{the charge of}} converting a woman to the faith though she herself stated {{that she had been}} a lifelong Bahá’í. Newspaper accounts describe this as the first Bahá’í execution in six years. Death sentences had also been passed against Sirus Zabhi-Moghaddam and Hedayat Kashefi-Najabadi, which <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> not yet been carried out and Ataollah Hamid Nazrizadeh has received a ten-year prison sentence for related offences arising from the same situation.|$|E

25|$|The {{well-known}} red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor) {{from the}} Mae Klong river of The Bridge on the River Kwai fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution {{and other forms}} of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium fish trade by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> been established again successfully from captive stock. Balitoridae and Cobitidae, meanwhile, contain {{a very large number of}} species about which essentially nothing is known except how they look and where they were first found.|$|E
25|$|Interested in {{the will}} of the late John Savage, Frankie consults her family's {{solicitor}} in London and learns that Carstairs consulted him too. Savage was staying with Mr and Mrs Templeton when he became convinced he had cancer, although one specialist told him he was perfectly well. When he died by suicide, his will left seven hundred thousand pounds to the Templetons, who <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> since left England. Carstairs was on their trail, suspicious of the will. Bobby is kidnapped and Frankie is lured to the same isolated cottage by Roger. They manage to turn the tables on him with the timely arrival of Badger Beadon and find a drugged Moira in the house. When the police arrive, Roger has escaped.|$|E
25|$|Upon waking, the Doctor {{traces the}} psychic signal linking their dreams back to Clara {{and is able}} to pull the crab off, only to learn that Clara is now an elderly woman. Sixty-two years <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> elapsed since they last met. As they become reacquainted, the Doctor expresses regret over not coming back for her sooner. Suddenly, Santa appears and {{encourages}} the Doctor to act before it is too late. The Doctor, realizing he is still dreaming, wakes up for real and rushes to the real Clara. He frees her from the crab to find, to their mutual relief, that she is still a young adult. Wanting no regrets and offering her all of time and space, the Doctor implores Clara to join him again. Clara happily accepts. As the pair depart, they are unaware of a tangerine having been left on Clara's windowsill.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} archaeological evidence, bronze {{crossbow}} bolts dating from {{as early as}} the mid-5th century BC have been found at a Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with a bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, were found in Tombs 3 and 12 at Qufu, Shandong, previously the capital of Lu. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan Province and dated to the mid-4th century BC. However, ammunition for crossbows could <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> also been shaped as spherical bullets. Jing Fang (78-37 BC), a Western-Han era Chinese mathematician and music theorist, discussed astronomical topics such as solar and lunar eclipses. He wrote that the moon, shaped like a ball, produced no light, yet instead acted like a mirror in reflecting the light illuminated only by the sun, which he compared to the shape of a round crossbow bullet.|$|E
25|$|Among Rabbinitic authors Jacob quotes Abu al-Walid ibn Janah; but his {{quotations}} <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> been intentionally {{suppressed by}} Firkovich in his edition (see Abraham Harkavy, Altjüdische Denkmäler aus der Krim, p.211, note 1), {{though they are}} found in the manuscripts, and one of them has been given in the edition (on Jer. iv. 37; fol. 2b, line 1). If Jacob read Abu al-Walid not in the Arabic original but in the Hebrew translation, he must have compiled his book {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century. Abraham Firkovich believes Jacob to have lived at Kerch, in southern Russia, said to have been called in Hebrew; and he asserts that the quoted several times in the commentary to the Pentateuch is identical with Abraham ben Simhah of Kerch (c. 986), a personage invented by him. Both of these assumptions are tenuous at best, and most scholars reject them. Jacob was probably a native of Constantinople, as his commentary contains Greek language glosses; and he appears to have been influenced by Byzantine authors.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{have not}} been {{mentioned}} as prey in Eurasia in dietary studies of nesting golden eagles. However, they {{have been reported in}} nests in North America. The two largest known reports are from coastal California and along the Porcupine River in Alaska, with fish making up 3.6% and 3.5% of the diets, respectively. Most reported species are trout and salmon from the Salmo and Oncorhynchus genera, although other species have also been hunted, including suckers (Catostomus), Sacramento perch (Archoptiles interruptus) and the northern pike (Esox lucius). Fish <b>have</b> <b>apparently</b> been captured in Scotland on rare occasions, although they {{have not been}} reported in the breeding season diet. Golden eagles have been observed around the Sea of Okhotsk (especially along Northern Japan) to join large numbers of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Steller's sea eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus) in winter to scavenge and capture various, locally abundant fish amongst ice-floes. Perhaps the most improbable prey reported in the golden eagle's diet are insects. They've been reported in small quantities in the French Pyrenees, the Italian Alps and Bulgaria. There is no information on how golden eagles capture insects or what kind of insects they hunt, although slower, larger, terrestrial insects like large beetles seems likely.|$|E
