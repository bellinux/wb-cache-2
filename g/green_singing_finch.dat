50|$|Whiteheart was {{pursued by}} every major Christian label until Chris Christian heard their demo and signed them to Home Sweet Home Records {{and gave them}} their first record deal. By the time they {{released}} their third album, they were selling in excess of 250,000 albums. After their self-titled debut album was released in 1982, the band suffered its first lineup change.

5000|$|The text {{comes from}} two sources: a popular ballad called [...] "The Cruel Mother", and {{passages}} from various mummers plays, the folk plays of the English countryside. The soprano, Mrs. <b>Green,</b> <b>sings</b> the ballad while {{the actors and}} mime perform the play. The two ingredients never meet; both are completely self-contained, involved only in themselves. But near the end, in the final tableau, there is a slight acknowledgement of each other's worlds when the presenter of the mummers' play, Father Christmas, completes the story Mrs. Green has been telling, and Mrs. Green momentarily enters the mummers’ acting area.|$|R

5000|$|On December 31, 2011, <b>Green</b> <b>sang</b> John Lennon's [...] "Imagine" [...] {{just prior}} to the ball drop for New Year's Eve at New York City's Times Square. In his rendition, Green {{replaced}} the line [...] "and no religion, too" [...] with the words [...] "and all religion's true".

I was trying to say a world where u could believe what u wanted that's all" [...] sic Green deleted a series of tweets pertaining to this event shortly thereafter.|$|R

40|$|SummaryLearned vocalizations {{depend on}} the ear's ability to monitor and {{ultimately}} instruct the voice. Where is auditory feedback processed in the brain, {{and how does it}} modify motor networks for learned vocalizations? Here we addressed these questions using singing-triggered microstimulation and chronic recording methods in the <b>singing</b> zebra <b>finch,</b> a small songbird that relies on auditory feedback to learn and maintain its species-typical vocalizations. Manipulating the singing-related activity of feedback-sensitive thalamic neurons subsequently triggered vocal plasticity, constraining the central pathway and functional mechanisms through which feedback-related information shapes vocalization.

5000|$|The {{first part}} of the song {{features}} a fast blues guitar riff played by Green, joined subsequently by Danny Kirwan and bassist John McVie, before a musical silence, punctuated only by Mick Fleetwood's cowbell percussion. <b>Green</b> <b>sings</b> a brief verse with no musical accompaniment, before the riff begins again and Kirwan takes a solo. Another silence precedes a second verse, and a replay of the riff. Where the second part follows, there is a brief pause before Green's sombre, Spanish-style acoustic guitar and low electric guitar, leading to further instrumental passages of recorder, cello and piano, the latter played by Jeremy Spencer. This was Spencer's only contribution to the song, as he was absent from the recording of [...] "Part 1", and Green played all the other instruments heard during [...] "Part 2".|$|R
