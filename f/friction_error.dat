P 2 L 2 is an acronym for Pulse Phase Locked Loop. The ultrasound system which measures the stress that occurs when a bolt becomes elongated in the process of tightening, transmits sound waves to the bolt being fastened and receives a return signal indicating changes in bolt stress. Results are translated into a digital reading of the actual stress on the bolt. Device monitors the bolt tensioning process on mine roof bolts that provide increased safety within the mine.

40|$|In photo, an {{engineer}} {{is using a}} new Ultrasonic Bolt Stress Monitor developed by NASA's Langley Research Center {{to determine whether a}} bolt is properly tightened. A highly accurate device, the monitor is an important tool in construction of such structures as pressure vessels, bridges and power plants, wherein precise measurement of the stress on a tightened bolt is critical. Overtightened or undertightened bolts can fail and cause serious industrial accidents or costly equipment break-downs. There are a number of methods for measuring bolt stress. Most widely used and least costly is the torque wrench, which is inherently inaccurate; it {{does not take into account}} the friction between nut and bolt, which has an influence on stress. At the other end of the spectrum, there are accurate stress-measuring systems, but they are expensive and not portable. The battery-powered Langley monitor fills a need; it is inexpensive, lightweight, portable and extremely accurate because it is not subject to <b>friction</b> <b>error.</b> Sound waves are transmitted to the bolt and a return signal is received. As the bolt is tightened, it undergoes changes in resonance due to stress, in the manner that a violin string changes tone when it is tightened. The monitor measures the changes in resonance and provides a reading of real stress on the bolt. The device, patented by NASA, has aroused wide interest and a number of firms have applied for licenses to produce it for the commercial market...|$|E
40|$|An {{enhanced}} {{understanding of}} material behaviour during rapid loading allows designers {{to improve the}} safety and efficiency of industrial processes and commercial products. These improvements are due, in part, {{to the use of}} increasingly powerful and sophisticated numerical simulation codes, which in tum, depend on accurate high strain rate material data. A Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) facility had previously been developed at the University of Cape Town to allow high strain rate testing of materials in compression. However, uncertainties regarding aspects of the test method that can affect the accuracy of the results, such as interface friction and specimen inertia, still required further clarification. This report details a thorough experimental and numerical investigation into the effect of friction on SHPB test data. The objectives are to assess the magnitude of the effect of friction under various conditions and to suggest strategies for reducing <b>friction</b> <b>error</b> in SHPB tests to an acceptable level. The ring compression test was used to obtain experimental friction factors. The effect of surface finish, lubricant, and strain rate on the friction experienced by mild steel, copper and aluminium samples was investigated. Numerical simulation was used to assess an energy-based analytical solution by Avitzur [1], and in particular to establish the effect of neglecting barrelling. Avitzur's analytical solution [l] Was then used to interpret the experimental results. The tested specimen microstructure was examined and used to estimate the stress distribution in the specimen during deformation. Uneven deformation and fold-over diminished at higher strain rates. Optimal surface finish and lubricant conditions were found for which experimentally measured coulomb friction coefficients lay between J. l = 0. 04 and 0. 08, with copper samples exhibiting marginally higher friction. By Avitzur's analytical solution [1] the error in SHPB tests under these recommended conditions was estimated to lie between 1 % and 2 %. The results show that roughened compression and specimen surfaces, lubricated with a suitable grease containing molybdenum disulphide, are useful in effectively reducing the error in SHPB tests due to friction effects...|$|E

To reduce <b>friction</b> <b>errors,</b> a novel time-varying friction compensation method is proposed {{to solve the}} problem that the traditional friction compensation methods hardly deal with. This problem leads to an unsatisfactory friction compensation performance and the motion and contour accuracies cannot be maintained effectively. In this method, a trapezoidal compensation pulse is adopted to compensate for the <b>friction</b> <b>errors.</b> A generalized regression neural network algorithm is used to generate the optimal pulse amplitude function. The optimal pulse duration function and the pulse amplitude function can be established by the pulse characteristic parameter learning and then the optimal friction compensation pulse can be generated. The feasibility of friction compensation method was verified on a high-precision X-Y worktable. The experimental results indicated that the motion and contour accuracies were improved greatly with reduction of the <b>friction</b> <b>errors,</b> in different working conditions. Moreover, the overall friction compensation performance indicators were decreased by more than 54 % and this friction compensation method can be implemented easily on most of servomechanisms in industry...|$|R

The companions are currently weakly interacting with the primary galaxy, but have short dynamical friction timescales (~ 1 Gyr) suggesting that these triple galaxy systems will shortly collapse into one massive galaxy. Given that the companions are consistent with being in circular rotation about the primary galaxy, {{and that they have}} small relative masses, the resulting merger will be a minor one.

The variance ratios are also substantially lower during periods of the year when prices are most sensitive to the weather. Moreover, the comovement of returns and volatilities for related commodities is stronger during the weather-sensitive season, largely due to stronger comovement during nontrading periods. These results are consistent with a strong link between prices and public information flow and cannot be explained by pricing errors or changes in trading activity. A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE FINANCE LITERATURE investigates the link between information and prices. Theory suggests that prices are a function of public information and order flow (see, e. g., Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Kyle (1985), and Glosten and Milgrom (1985)). Order flow is driven by both public and private information as well as investor shocks, which may be either rational (e. g., noninformation-based liquidity trades) or irrational (e. g., trades based on noise as described by Black (1986)).

Our calculation induces a reasonable approximation, the error made on estimated speed reflects the fact that speed depends on the flow conditions as well as on measurement parameters like the bore and the volume flow rate. The estimate of the Doppler signal frequency enables us to determine the maximum Doppler frequencie F d max as well as the maximum flow speed. The results show that the difference between the estimated frequencies (F de) and the Doppler frequencies (F d) is small, this variation tends to zero for important θ angles and it is proportional to the diameter D. The description of the speed of friction and the coefficient of <b>friction</b> justify the <b>error</b> rate obtained. Keywords—Doppler frequency, Doppler spectrum, estimate speed, permanent flow. - diffuser is parallel to the walls of the blood vessels. - the blood vessel is a rigid cylindrical tube, an assumption which eliminates the vibrations of the walls M. D. - the flow is permanent, which involves that the amplitude of the Doppler signal as well as the speed are constant while the particle passes through the volume of measurement. The designed model simulates blood circulation by means of latex pipes of different diameters (4, 6, 8) mm, the circulating fluid is an aqueous solution containing micro- spheres with a diameter of 10 µ m, which is close {{to the size of the}} blood cells. The density of the solution is 1 g/cm 3 and is measured at ambient temperature. A flow meter was used to measure the flow and to check the states of steady flow (regular). An adapted positioning system was used to fix the probe plunged in water and to change with precision the θ angle. Pump I...|$|R
40|$|<b>Friction</b> causes {{important}} <b>errors</b> in {{the control}} of small servomechanism and should be determined with precision {{in order to increase}} the system performance. This paper describes the method to identify the model parameters of a small linear drive with ball-screw. Two kinds of friction models will be applied for the servomechanism looking to rise its micropositioning abilities. The first one includes the static, viscous and Stribeck friction with hysteresis, and the second one uses the Lugre model. The results will be compared taking into account the criterion error, the accuracy and the normalized mean-square-error of the identified mechanical parameters. The coefficients of the models are identified by a recursive identification method using data acquisition and special filtering technics. The least square identification method is used in this paper in order to establish the motor parameters used as initial condition of the recursive estimation method. Computer simulations and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.
