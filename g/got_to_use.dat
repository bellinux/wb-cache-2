500|$|He {{formed an}} {{effective}} partnership with fellow winger Ryan Fraser as Bournemouth enjoyed their best start to {{a season in}} the second tier in 2013–14. In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> your brain {{a little bit more}} than in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E
500|$|Santa's Little Helper's initial {{appearance}} on The Simpsons {{was in the}} first episode of the series, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which aired on Dec. 17, 1989. Since then, he has become a recurring character. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide in 2000 that [...] "we [...] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him." [...] The name [...] "Santa's Little Helper" [...] was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same TV Guide article, [...] "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this name." [...] Although [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the Houston Chronicle in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and [...] "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why." [...] He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.|$|E

Having already declined the band's employ {{in the distant past}} due to scheduling issues, he now accommodated. He admonished them, [...] "Don't try to write a hit. ... You have to have your love in mind, and a hit record might happen." [...] Scheff later reflected that Sisyphus [...] "was our statement ... taking all the motives away from , 'I've got to make a hit; I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> outside writers' material'". Walter Parazaider called it [...] "a record that had to be made." ...|$|E

The release of Imagination sparked a consecutive series of million-selling gold-certified albums for the label including the soundtrack to the movie, Claudine; I Feel a Song and 2nd Anniversary. In 1975, the group scored a mid-season variety series, The Gladys Knight & the Pips Show, that aired for four episodes on NBC. During this time, the group recorded more hit singles, including [...] "I Feel a Song (In My Heart)", [...] "Part-Time Love", [...] "Love Finds Its Own Way" [...] and the live recording, [...] "The Way We Were/Try to Remember".|$|E

[...] The first single [...] "If You Feel the Funk", became a modest hit, climbing into the Top 40 of the US R chart. Her second single, [...] "Night Time Lover", was produced by younger brother Michael, who provided backing vocals. In turn, she provided the opening scream on her brothers', The Jacksons, 1980 hit, [...] "This Place Hotel" [...] as well as backing vocals on brother Michael's 1984 solo hit [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)".|$|E
2500|$|The group reached {{commercial}} success after signing with Motown Records in 1966. After {{a year and}} a half, the group recorded the first hit single version of [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] in 1967, which led to several hit singles for Motown's Soul Records label, including [...] "Nitty Gritty", [...] "Friendship Train", [...] "If I Were Your Woman" [...] and [...] "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)", before leaving the label for Buddah Records in 1973, where they recorded the hits [...] "Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me", [...] "I've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Use</b> My Imagination" [...] and their number-one hit single, [...] "Midnight Train to Georgia". Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects until 1980 when they signed with Columbia Records. Later hits included [...] "Save the Overtime (For Me)" [...] and the Grammy-winning single [...] "Love Overboard". In 1989, the group disbanded with the Pips retiring and Knight embarking on a successful solo career.|$|E

[...] Lapham went on, as he scanned his newspaper, {{to give his}} ideas of public questions, in a fragmentary way, while Corey listened patiently, and {{waited for him to}} come back to business. He folded up his paper at last, and stuffed it into his coat pocket. [...] "There's one thing I always make it a rule to do," [...] he said, [...] "and that is to give my mind a complete rest from business while I'm going down on the boat. I like to get the fresh air all through me, soul and body. I believe a man can give his mind a rest, just the same as he can give his legs a rest, or his back. All he's got to do is to use his will-power. Why, I suppose, if I hadn't adopted some such rule, with the strain I've had on me for the last ten years, I should 'a' been a dead man long ago. That's the reason I like a horse. You've got to give your mind to the horse; you can't help it, unless you want to break your neck; but a boat's different, and there you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> your will-power. You got to take your mind right up and put it where you want it. I make it a rule to read the paper on the boat----Hold on!" [...] he interrupted himself to prevent Corey from paying his fare to the man who had come round for it. [...] "I've got tickets. And when I get through the paper, I try to get somebody to talk to, or I watch the people. It's an astonishing thing to me where they all come from. I've been riding up and down on these boats for six or seven years, and I don't know but very few of the faces I see on board. Seems to be a perfectly fresh lot every time. Well, of course! Town's full of strangers in the summer season, anyway, and folks keep coming down from the country. They think it's a great thing {{to get down to the}} beach, and they've all heard of the electric light on the water, and they want to see it. But you take faces now! The astonishing thing to me is not what a face tells, but what it don't tell. When you think of what a man is, or a woman is, and what most of 'em have been through before they get to be thirty, it seems as if their experience would burn right through. But it don't. I like to watch the couples, and try to make out which are engaged, or going to be, and which are married, or better be. But half the time I can't make any sort of guess. Of course, where they're young and kittenish, you can tell; but where they're anyways on, you can't. Heigh?" ...|$|E
