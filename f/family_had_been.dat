5|$|Conroy was {{descended from}} the Ó Maolconaire family of Elphin, County Roscommon. The <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the {{hereditary}} Ollamhs to the O'Connor Kings of Connacht. He was descended from Maoilin Ó Maolchonaire who was the last recognised Chief of the Sept.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at {{the time}} of the {{shooting}} of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918. Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> burnt, and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July Warwick had to {{withdraw}} from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> benefactors. In value, his possessions were second only {{to those of the}} earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England.|$|E
50|$|Since 1874, two <b>families</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{involved}} with the Record. The Hoch family owned it for 124 years. The Meyer <b>family</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> involved for more than 60 years.|$|R
50|$|His father's {{side of the}} <b>family</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{traced back}} to France. His mother's side of the <b>family</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> traced to the island of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti); in the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|The Petre <b>family</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> staunchly {{loyal to}} Roman Catholicism. It {{was the first}} Baron who {{publicly}} acknowledged his Catholicism. At least twelve members of the <b>family</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Jesuits. The <b>family</b> <b>has</b> also produced two bishops, Francis (1692-1775) and Benjamin (1672-1758). These two were coadjutor bishops of, respectively, Bishop Dicconson and Bishop Challoner.|$|R
5|$|Isaac Shelby {{was born}} in the Province of Maryland on December 11, 1750, near Hagerstown in Frederick (now Washington) County. He was the third child and second son of Evan and Letitia (Cox) Shelby, who immigrated from Tregaron, Wales, in 1735. Though the <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> loyal to the Church of England, they became Presbyterians after coming to British America; this was the {{denomination}} Isaac Shelby embraced during his life.|$|E
5|$|Judah Philip Benjamin {{was born}} on August 11, 1811, in St. Croix of the Danish West Indies (today the United States Virgin Islands), a colony then {{occupied}} by the British during the Napoleonic Wars. His parents were Sephardic Jews, Philip Benjamin and the former Rebecca de Mendes. Philip and Rebecca had been shopkeepers in London, and emigrated to the West Indies in search of better opportunities. Rebecca's <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prominent in Spain before being forced to leave under the Expulsion Edict of 1492.|$|E
5|$|She was {{an elder}} sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, whose alleged {{escape from the}} {{assassination}} of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years. However, it was later proven that Anastasia did not escape. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Maria might have been the grand duchess whose remains were missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near Yekaterinburg, Russia and exhumed in 1991. However, further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered in 1918.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, Sylvanian <b>Families</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{discontinued}} in the UK, although since 1999, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reintroduced by Flair. Subsequently, Sylvanian <b>families</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reintroduced in Australia and {{are becoming more}} widely available there. Tomy stopped selling Calico Critters, but a new company, International Playthings, picked up the line.|$|R

5|$|Tadeusz Rejtan {{was born}} on 20 August 1742 in Hruszówka (now, Hrushauka, Belarus) (date as given in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, some other sources give other dates). He {{was the son of}} a minor, but {{relatively}} wealthy noble, Dominik Rejtan, podkomorzy of Nowogródek (today Navahrudak, Belarus) and Teresa Wołodkowicz. He was likely the oldest of five brothers. His brother, Michał, would come to hold the position of pisarz (scribe) of Nowogródek. His grandfather, also named Michał, was the skarbnik (treasurer) of Mazyr. The <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> aligned to the powerful Radziwiłł family, and Tadeusz would also pledge his allegiance to them.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not died, that his funeral was staged, and that he had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E

5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought {{to locate a}} woman he had met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with her <b>family,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E

5|$|John Marshall Harlan {{was born}} on May 20, 1899 in Chicago, Illinois. He {{was the son of}} John Maynard Harlan, a Chicago lawyer and politician, and Elizabeth Flagg. He had three sisters. Historically, Harlan's <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{politically}} active. His forebear, George Harlan, served as one of governors of Delaware during the seventeenth century; his great-grandfather, James Harlan, was a congressman during the 1830s; his grandfather, also John Marshall Harlan, was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911; and his uncle, James S. Harlan, was attorney general of Puerto Rico and then chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{was born}} in the village of Đông Thái in the {{northern}} central coast province of Hà Tĩnh. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking mandarins and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the Lê Dynasty. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins. Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan {{as an example of how}} an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Beaumaris Castle was a strategic location in the war, as it controlled part of the route between the king's bases in Ireland and his operations in England. Thomas Bulkeley, whose <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> involved {{in the management of}} the castle for several centuries, held Beaumaris for the king and may have spent around £3,000 improving its defences. By 1646, however, Parliament had defeated the royal armies and the castle was surrendered by Colonel Richard Bulkeley in June. Anglesey revolted against Parliament again in 1648, and Beaumaris was briefly reoccupied by royalist forces, surrendering for a second time in October that year.|$|E

5|$|The Hippisley <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> lords of {{the manor}} of Ston Easton and {{surrounding}} areas since the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century. They acquired several local manors, some {{in association with}} William Rosewell. Preston Hippisley bequeathed the manor of Ston Easton to his daughter who married John Coxe of Leigh, Wiltshire, a Member of Parliament for Milborne Port. Her son John Hippisley-Coxe married a rich heiress, Mary Northliegh of Peamore in the parish of Exminster in Devon, and with his increased wealth commenced {{the building of the}} present mansion. They moved from the old manor house next to the parish church of St Mary The Virgin, Ston Easton to an ancient gabled Tudor house and started to convert it into a Palladian mansion with landscaped parkland and gardens.|$|E
5|$|The mid-fifteenth century {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the private feuds of the nobility, and the Wars of the Roses in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud. This was between Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, whose <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> earls of that county since 1335 and William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, historian Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{was born}} in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His <b>family</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prominent, but its {{fortunes}} had declined {{by the time of}} Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended Lichfield Grammar School (now King Edward VI School) and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget's sons, and in 1638, with James Paget's help, he qualified as a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a déclassé Cheshire aristocratic family, who died, while pregnant, only three years later on 6 December 1641. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth. He also became allied with Major-General Charles Worsley (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at Westminster Abbey), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John Booth, of Salford.|$|E
