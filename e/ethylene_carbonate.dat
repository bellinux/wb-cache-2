Cyclic voltammetry results showed that large oxidation-reduction current of the copper foil appeared in <b>ethylene</b> carbonate/dimethyl <b>carbonate</b> solutions, while a much smaller current in the room temperature ionic liquid electrolytes decreased gradually, indicating that the copper foil was anodically stable. Further study by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that an unstable product was composed mainly of the carbonate and carbonyl species {{on the surface of}} the copper foil after the electrochemical measurement in <b>ethylene</b> carbonate/dimethyl <b>carbonate</b> solutions, leading to the dissolution of the copper foil. While a better passivating film from the reduction of the anions in the room temperature ionic liquid electrolytes covered the surface of copper foil and protected the copper foil from being oxidized even in a higher potential. These results indicate that the use of room temperature ionic liquid electrolytes can improve the stability of copper current collector in the advanced lithium ion batteries.

This system has been successfully applied to families of solvents not accessible so far by SET-LRP such as polar and nonpolar non-disproportionation solvents. Here we report a series of screening experiments on biphasic mixtures of water with linear diethyl and dimethyl carbonates, cyclic propylene and <b>ethylene</b> <b>carbonates,</b> the cyclic ethers THF and dioxane, and with dipolar aprotic solvents. Two general methodologies were applied in the catalytic process: the accelerated "multicomponent" Cu(0) generated by the in situ reduction of Cu(II) Br- 2 with NaBH 4 and the "single component" Cu(0) wire. All carbonates and ethers provide linear kinetic SET-LRP experiments when solvent/water = 8 / 2, v/v were used while under the same conditions dipolar aprotic solvents increased their apparent rate constant of polymerization up to about 3. 5 times from the values obtained in the absence of water.
