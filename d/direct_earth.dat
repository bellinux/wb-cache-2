In this paper, relevant solutions on liquefaction induced lateral spreading are presented. Direct and indirect earth-pressure approximations and implementations are introduced. Pile foundation failures of 1995 Kobe earthquake were examined using these models. It {{was found that}} both the static and dynamic analyses could provide rational pile displacements in agreement with field observations. The largest pile displacements were found at the pile head from static modeling and the dynamic one using indirect earth pressures. For dynamic solutions with <b>direct</b> <b>earth</b> pressure approximations, maximum pile displacements were found at pile tip. These solutions seem reasonable to model different types of lateral spreading.

40|$|Future Mars {{exploration}} missions, both robotic and piloted, may utilize Earth to Mars transfer trajectories {{that are}} {{significantly different from}} one another, depending upon the type of mission being flown and the time period during which the flight takes place. The use of new or emerging technologies for future missions to Mars, such as aerobraking and nuclear rocket propulsion, may yield navigation requirements that are much more stringent than those of past robotic missions, and {{are very difficult to}} meet for some trajectories. This article explores the interdependencies between the properties of <b>direct</b> <b>Earth</b> to Mars trajectories and the Mars approach navigation accuracy that can be achieved using different radio metric data types, such as ranging measurements between an approaching spacecraft and Mars orbiting relay satellites, or Earth based measurements such as coherent Doppler and very long baseline interferometry.

40|$|The Gravity Tractor (GT) is a fully {{controlled}} asteroid deflection concept {{using the}} mutual gravity between a robotic spacecraft and an asteroid to slowly accelerate the asteroid {{in the direction}} of the "hovering" spacecraft. Based on early warning, provided by ground tracking and orbit prediction, it would be deployed a decade or more prior to a potential impact. Ion engines would be utilized for both the rendezvous with the asteroid and the towing phase. Since the GT does not dock with or otherwise physically contact the asteroid during the deflection process there is no requirement for knowledge of the asteroid's shape, composition, rotation state or other "conventional" characteristics. The GT would first reduce the uncertainty in the orbit of the asteroid via Earth tracking of its radio transponder while station keeping with the asteroid. If, after analysis of the more precise asteroid orbit a deflection is indeed indicated, the GT would "hover" above the surface of the asteroid {{in the direction of}} the required acceleration vector for a duration adequate to achieve the desired velocity change. The orbit of the asteroid is continuously monitored throughout the deflection process and the end state is known in real time. The performance envelope for the GT includes most NEOs which experience close gravitational encounters prior to impact and those below 150 - 200 meters in diameter on a <b>direct</b> <b>Earth</b> impact trajectory.

40|$|A {{previous}} study demonstrated that connecting {{the human body}} to the earth during sleep (earthing) normal-izes the daily cortisol rhythm and improves sleep. A variety of other benefits were reported, including reduc-tions in pain and inflammation. Subsequent studies have confirmed these earlier findings and documented vir-tually immediate physiologic and clinical effects of grounding or earthing the body. It is well established, though not widely known, that {{the surface of the}} earth possesses a limitless and continuously renewed supply of free or mobile electrons as a consequence of a global atmospheric electron circuit. Wearing shoes with insulating soles and/or sleeping in beds that are isolated from the electrical ground plane of the earth have disconnected most people from the earth’s electrical rhythms and free electrons. The most reasonable hypothesis to explain the beneficial effects of earthing is that a <b>direct</b> <b>earth</b> connection enables both diurnal electrical rhythms and free electrons to flow from the earth to the body. It is proposed that the earth’s diurnal electrical rhythms set the biological clocks for hormones that regulate sleep and activity. It is also suggested that free electrons from the earth neutralize the positively charged free radicals that are the hallmark of chronic inflammation. A rela-tionship between cortisol and inflammation was established in the pioneering work of H. Selye published in the 1950 s. Current biomedical research has led to an inflammation hypothesis that is establishing chronic in-flammation as the culprit behind almost every modern chronic illness. The research summarized here and in subsequent reports provides a basis for a number of earthing technologies that restore and maintain natural elec-trical contact between the human body and the earth throughout the day and night in situations where going barefoot on the earth is impractical. It is proposed that free or mobile electrons from the earth can resolve chronic inflammation by serving as natural antioxidants. 95...|$|E
40|$|Utilization of {{extraterrestrial}} resources, or In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), {{is viewed}} by the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise as an enabling technology for the exploration and commercial development of space. A key subset of ISRU which has significant cost, mass, and risk reduction benefits for robotic and human exploration, and which requires a minimum of infrastructure, is In-Situ Consumable Production (ISCP). ISCP involves acquiring, manufacturing, and storing mission consumables from in situ resources, such as propellants, fuel cell reagents, and gases for crew and life support, inflation, science and pneumatic equipment. One of the four long-term goals for the Space Science Enterprise (SSE) is to 'pursue space science programs that enable and are enabled by future human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit - a goal exploiting the synergy with the human exploration of space'. Adequate power and propulsion capabilities are critical for both robotic and human exploration missions. Minimizing the mass and volume of these systems can reduce mission cost or enhance the mission by enabling the incorporation of new science or mission-relevant equipment. Studies have shown that in-situ production of oxygen and methane propellants can enhance sample return missions by enabling larger samples {{to be returned to}} Earth or by performing <b>Direct</b> <b>Earth</b> Return (DER) sample return missions instead of requiring a Mars Orbit Rendezvous (MOR). Recent NASA and Department of Energy (DOE) work on oxygen and hydrocarbon-based fuel cell power systems shows the potential of using fuel cell power systems instead of solar arrays and batteries for future rovers and science equipment.

40|$|NASA's {{exploration}} roadmap {{is focused}} on developing technologies and performing precursor missions to advance {{the state of the}} art for eventual human missions to Mars. One of the key components of this roadmap is various robotic missions to Near-Earth Objects, the Moon, and Mars to fill in some of the strategic knowledge gaps. The Resource Prospector (RP) project is one of these robotic precursor activities in the roadmap. RP is a multi-center and multi-institution project to investigate the polar regions of the Moon in search of volatiles. The mission is rated Class D and is approximately 10 days, assuming a five day <b>direct</b> <b>Earth</b> to Moon transfer. Because of the mission cost constraint, a trade study of the propulsion concepts was conducted with a focus on available low-cost hardware for reducing cost in development, while technical risk, system mass, and technology advancement requirements were also taken into consideration. The propulsion system for the lander is composed of a braking stage providing a high thrust to match the lander's velocity with the lunar surface and a lander stage performing the final lunar descent. For the braking stage, liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (LCH 4) propulsion systems, derived from the Morpheus experimental lander, and storable bi-propellant systems, including the 4 th stage Peacekeeper (PK) propulsion components and Space Shuttle orbital maneuvering engine (OME), and a solid motor were considered for the study. For the lander stage, the trade study included miniaturized Divert Attitude Control System (DACS) thrusters (Missile Defense Agency (MDA) heritage), their enhanced thruster versions, ISE- 100 and ISE- 5, and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. The lowest cost configuration of using the solid motor and the PK components while meeting the requirements was selected. The reference concept of the lander is shown in Figure 1. In the current reference configuration, the solid stage is the primary provider of delta-V. It will generate 15, 000 -lbf of thrust with a single burn of ~ 80 's seconds. The lander stage is a bi-propellant, pressure-regulated, pulsing liquid propulsion system to perform all other functions...|$|E

40|$|The Kepler Prize was {{a contest}} held {{this past year}} by The Mars Society to design the Mars <b>Direct</b> <b>Earth</b> Return Vehicle (ERV) in as great a detail as possible. This is the summary report of Team Daedalia, which won this {{international}} competition {{in the summer of}} 2004. SYSTEM OVERVIEW Before Project Constellation was announced, our design was made as modular as possible to allow for rapid construction, field serviceability, interchangeable part swapping for both repair of planned systems and, for future explorers, adaptation to unanticipated systems, and phased technology changes over the development of the ERV fleet. Nothing is done without reference to both pre-ERV needs and post-ERV re-use of system components on Mars. While the craft is divided into many sections, the design is somewhat unique in that a single passageway runs almost {{the entire length of the}} vehicle, from the base of the reentry capsule to the engine compartment in the back. This passageway, with rectangular doors at each break, allows suited crew members to switch to a pressurized environment the minute they arrive at the vehicle’s base. In an emergency, this could be critical. In addition to the internal ladder, a hoist assembly can lift large objects and crew members from the surface to the Mission Module. A small block and tackle can even finish the job of loading surface samples into the Command Module. The second major advantage of this feature is that the passage contains multiple access doors all the way to the surface. Any section can be closed off, depressurized (if appropriate) and access doors opened to allow repair at any point from the first stage engines to the Command Module. Finally, the pressurized tube down the middle of the entire vehicle acts as a backbone for structural purposes. The vehicle starts out very top-heavy on landing, and a separate structural component to take some of the weight away from the now-empty tanks is desirable. While other structural frameworks are used throughout the vehicle, having a core simplifies the compression element of the design. The craft is assembled from the following sections...|$|E
40|$|The {{next phase}} of Mars {{exploration}} will utilize a network of small low-cost landers, penetrators, microrovers and other surface devices to provide site-diversity. <b>Direct</b> <b>Earth</b> communications link, if required for these landers, will drive the lander design for two reasons: a) mass and complexity of a steerable high-gain antenna and b) electric power supply for high-power X-band amplifier (solar panel and battery mass). Total mass of the direct-Earth-link hardware for several recent small-lander designs exceeded mass of scientific payload. Alternatively, local UHF communication link via a relay spacecraft can be used. Resource requirements of this link are comparatively trivial; a simple whip antenna and less than 1 Watt power. Clearly, using a Mars Relay Space craft (MRS) is the preferred option if MRS can be accomplished in an affordable and robust way. Our paper describes a point design of such mission. We have asked the following question: What is the lowest-cost MRS spacecraft design {{that can be used}} for relaying scientific data from stations on Martian surface to Earth as well as for commanding these stations? Specifically, requirements for our MRS study were based on the latest IMEWG mission model for post- 2001 era. The typical data return is total 65 Mbit/sol from six landers to be relayed in one 4 -hour DSN contact using 34 -m subnet. The mission design assumes dedicated MRS launch on the NASA Small Expendable Launch Vehicle to LEO parking orbit. Small spin-stabilized upper stage (Star- 27) will inject the space craft to the Mars transfer orbit. The capability of this configuration is 98 kg (to C 3 = 10. 2 kg 2 /m 2). The spacecraft provides all propulsion after injection: trajectory corrections, Mars orbit insertion and maintenance, and attitude control. The simple blowdown monopropellant hydrazine system has Δv capability of 1850 m/sec. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized, with the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth. Solar panel is behind this optically transparent (mesh) antenna and is sized for continuous transmitter operation under the worst-case conditions. Highly-integrated electronics is contained in a single unit with the exception of RF hardware and attitude sensors. The attitude determination is performed with a simple V-slit star and sun crossing sensors. Standard X-Band Small Deep-Space Transponder (SDST) is used for the DSN communications and UHF transceiver is used for the in-situ communications at 400 MHz. No antenna switching nor reconfiguration is required. Estimated spacecraft dry mass of 42 kg has 20 % margin. Power requirement is 23 W for spacecraft housekeeping and 17 - 40 W DC for high-power transmitter (depending on orbit geometry). This MRS point design requires no post-launch deployments, has no moving parts and its full functional redundancy and expendables budget is compatible with five year lifetime in Mars orbit. The estimated life-cycle cost of this mission is less than $ 50 M (including launch and mission operations) ...|$|E
40|$|Mars Sample Return (MSR) is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the recent Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This paper presents an overview of a feasibility study for a MSR mission. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether emerging commercial capabilities can be used to reduce the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of reducing mission cost. The major element required for the MSR mission are described and include an integration of the emerging commercial capabilities with small spacecraft design techniques; new utilizations of traditional aerospace technologies; and recent technological developments. We report the feasibility of a complete and closed MSR mission design using the following scenario that covers three synodic launch opportunities, beginning with the 2022 opportunity: A Falcon Heavy injects a SpaceX Red Dragon capsule and trunk onto a Trans Mars Injection (TMI) trajectory. The capsule is modified to carry all the hardware needed to return samples collected on Mars including a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV); an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV); and hardware to transfer a sample collected in a previously landed rover mission to the ERV. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retro Propulsion (SRP). After previously collected samples are transferred to the ERV, the single-stage MAV launches the ERV from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. The MAV uses a storable liquid, pump fed bi-propellant propulsion system. After a brief phasing period, the ERV, which also uses a storable bi-propellant system, performs a Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn. Once near Earth the ERV performs Earth and lunar swing-bys and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit (LTO 0 - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A later mission, using a Dragon and launched by a Falcon Heavy, performs a rendezvous with the ERV in the lunar trailing orbit, retrieves the sample container and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft, makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of pristine Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere. Other capsule type vehicles and associated launchers may be applicable. The analysis methods employed standard and specialized aerospace engineering tools. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships (MERs). The architecture was iterated until overall mission convergence was achieved on at least one path. Subsystems analyzed in this study include support structures, power system, nose fairing, thermal insulation, actuation devices, MAV exhaust venting, and GN&C. Best practice application of loads, mass growth contingencies, and resource margins were used. For Falcon Heavy capabilities and Dragon subsystems we utilized publically available data from SpaceX; published analyses from other sources; as well as our own engineering and aerodynamic estimates. Earth Launch mass is under 11 mt, which is within the estimated capability of a Falcon Heavy, with margin. Total entry masses between 7 and 10 mt were considered with closure occurring between 9 and 10 mt. Propellant mass fractions for each major phase of the EDL - Entry, Terminal Descent, and Hazard Avoidance - have been derived. An assessment of the entry conditions on the thermal protection system (TPS), currently in use for Dragon missions, has been made. And shows no significant stressors. A useful mass of 2. 0 mt is provided and includes mass growth allowances for the MAV, the ERV, and mission unique equipment. We also report on alternate propellant options for the MAV and options for the ERV, including propulsion systems; crewed versus robotic retrieval mission; as well as <b>direct</b> <b>Earth</b> entry. International Planetary Protection Policies as well as verifiable means of compliance will have a large impact on any MSR mission design. We identify areas within our architecture where such impacts occur.
