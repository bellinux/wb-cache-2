This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to <b>gain</b> <b>an</b> <b>overview</b> of the Cassino battlefield. Near the top of the mountain, he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured both legs to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated to a medical centre, and the other foot and the lower portions of both legs were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some disbelief and shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E

50|$|The driving impetus behind {{establishing}} {{this information}} system - initially for Germany (German Travel Monitor) and Europe - {{was the fact}} that it was not possible for decision-makers in the tourism field, based on the information available to them up to that point in time, to <b>gain</b> <b>an</b> <b>overview</b> of the European market or any overseas markets (in the form of a database enabling a direct comparison of aspects such as the volume and structure of outbound trips taken by the Germans, Americans, British, Russians, Chinese, etc.).

50|$|Born August 22, 1909 in Leipzig, Germany as {{the eldest}} child of {{mathematics}} teacher Georg and Anna Kietz, Erhard Karl Kietz attended the Nikolai School in Leipzig and then studied physics, mathematics and chemistry at the University of Leipzig.

Along that line, he also had an independent, critical view of political proceedings. He was very interested in politics but opposed the extremism that he saw arising within nations.During his studies at the University, he was an assistant to Dr. August Karolus, television pioneer, in the laboratory of the Physical Institute of the University from May 1929 to Feb. 1938. From March 1938 until May 1945, he conducted independent research in the same laboratory as physicist in the fields of television, high frequency and amplification technology. Aside from television, his major field of work was the origination of extremely constant oscillation through tuning forks and oscillating crystals. During World War II, he was twice buried in the rubble of bomb attacks on the Institute of Physics at the University of Leipzig.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the rise}} of online social networks, sharing of {{personal}} information online has become the rule for many people rather than the exception. However, users have only limited abilities to effectively control privacy of their posted information. Even <b>gaining</b> <b>an</b> <b>overview</b> of posted information is already a difficult task. We propose a privacy control system for personal information online. PrivacyJudge allows fine-grained access control to posted information and provides <b>a</b> comprehensive <b>overview</b> of previously posted data. Thereby, PrivacyJudge does not require cooperation of service providers, instead operation remains transparent to them. Thus effectively providing privacy protection against other users and service providers alike. PrivacyJudge follows a hybrid approach combining cryptographic enforcement with social signaling to achieve privacy protection beyond technical enforcement boundaries by leveraging system trust {{as well as social}} trust mechanisms.

50|$|CARE was {{a three-year}} European CSA project that fostered greener {{aviation}} and related {{research and development}} activities. Placing particular focus on SMEs and labs, this was achieved through cooperation between regional aerospace clusters and {{the adoption of a}} harmonised agenda approach. In order to reach a sustainable degree of competitiveness, the European aviation industry - from OEMs to SMEs - must take on an increasingly ecological and innovative approach. Green technologies are key competitive advantages of all future air transport systems. For SMEs in the innovative and forward-looking green aerospace sector, a sufficient balance between today’s business growth requirements and tomorrow’s stakes must be found. Thus, as the backbone of the European economy, SMEs require special support and attention. The European clusters are rooted in both the local and regional economy. They know exactly what their region requires and have an up-to-date view of their (regional) position within green aviation. The CARE methodologies allowed for a comparison between cluster profiles and enabled other clusters to join the CARE Meta Cluster. An initial study identified major technological fields which bear potentially high impacts on the Europeanaviation ecosystem and were thus of significant relevance to all participating regions and clusters. In order to <b>gain</b> <b>an</b> <b>overview</b> on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these technological fields in our regions, the CARE project conducted a comprehensive SWOT analysis. Last but not least, it defined a „Joint Action Plan” that included 21 concrete actions and aims to strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs and labs.|$|E
