5|$|<b>Genome</b> size varies greatly between species. The {{smallest}} viral genomes– the ssDNA circoviruses, family Circoviridae– {{code for}} only two proteins and have a <b>genome</b> size of only two kilobases; the largest–the pandoraviruses–have <b>genome</b> sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins. Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in the <b>genome</b> so that they overlap.|$|E
5|$|Horses have 64 chromosomes. The horse <b>genome</b> was sequenced in 2007. It {{contains}} 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, {{which is}} larger than the dog <b>genome,</b> but smaller than the human <b>genome</b> or the bovine <b>genome.</b> The map is available to researchers.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal <b>genome.</b> The tiny 490,885base-pair <b>genome</b> of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal <b>genome</b> known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
30|$|Of the {{variants}} {{shared by}} both Kelantan Royal <b>genomes,</b> the overlapping variants of both individual <b>genomes</b> are {{shared with the}} Asian and the African <b>genomes.</b> With {{the availability of the}} Asian <b>genomes</b> for comparison, the Han Chinese and the South Asian Indian, the positioning of Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) <b>genomes</b> were able to be determined.|$|R

25|$|Nineteen {{families}} are currently {{recognized by the}} ICTV that infect bacteria and archaea. Of these, only two families have RNA <b>genomes,</b> and only five {{families are}} enveloped. Of the viral families with DNA <b>genomes,</b> only two have single-stranded <b>genomes.</b> Eight of the viral families with DNA <b>genomes</b> have circular <b>genomes</b> while nine have linear <b>genomes.</b> Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (Tectiviridae) infects both bacteria and archaea.|$|R
5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the <b>genome.</b> For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same <b>genome,</b> then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain <b>genome</b> evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole <b>genome</b> duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{sequencing}} of the honey bee <b>genome</b> provided {{a possible explanation}} for the sensitivity of bees to pesticides. Its <b>genome</b> is deficient in the number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases, and carboxylesterases.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete <b>genome</b> {{of the apple}} in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant <b>genome</b> studied to date and more genes than the human <b>genome</b> (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple <b>genome</b> will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The <b>genome</b> sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
40|$|In special {{coordinates}} (codon position–specific nucleotide frequencies) bacterial <b>genomes</b> form {{two straight}} lines in 9 -dimensional space: one line for eubacterial <b>genomes,</b> another for archaeal <b>genomes.</b> All the 143 known bacterial <b>genomes</b> belong these lines with high accuracy, {{and these two}} lines are certainly different. Accuracy of mean-field (context-free) approximation is analyzed, and codon usage trajectories for bacterial <b>genomes</b> are presented...|$|R
30|$|Human Microbiome Project (HMP) oral {{reference}} <b>genomes</b> were downloaded ([URL] and concatenated {{into one}} large reference sequence. Alignment of the metagenomic reads to the HMP oral reference <b>genomes</b> was conducted using Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) {{to access the}} abundance of these reference <b>genomes</b> in the four sequenced saliva microbiota (to define the dominant <b>genomes)</b> and the sequence coverage of these reference <b>genomes</b> or their close phylogenetic neighbors in the four microbiota. MG-RAST annotation based on SEED subsystem was retrieved and the extracted nucleotide sequences encoding proteins were searched against the HMP oral reference <b>genomes</b> using BLASTN to identity their originating <b>genomes.</b> The dominant functions in the four levels in SEED and dominant <b>genomes</b> were defined according to their relative abundance. A database recording the diversity, abundance and originating <b>genomes</b> of the genes and their functions was thus constructed based on which {{the relationship of the}} dominant function and the dominant <b>genomes</b> would be examined.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{existing}} synteny block reconstruction algorithms use anchors (e. g., orthologous genes) shared {{over all}} <b>genomes</b> {{to construct the}} synteny blocks for multiple <b>genomes.</b> This approach, while efficient for a few <b>genomes,</b> cannot be scaled to address the need to construct synteny blocks in many mammalian <b>genomes</b> that are currently being sequenced. The {{problem is that the}} number of anchors shared among all <b>genomes</b> quickly decreases with {{the increase in the number}} of <b>genomes.</b> Another problem is that many <b>genomes</b> (plant <b>genomes</b> in particular) had extensive duplications, which makes decoding of genomic architecture and rearrangement analysis in plants difficult. The existing synteny block generation algorithms in plants do not address the issue of generating non-overlapping synteny blocks suitable for analyzing rearrangements and evolution history of duplications. We present a new algorithm based on the A-Bruijn graph framework that overcomes these difficulties and provides a unified approach to synteny block reconstruction for multiple <b>genomes,</b> and for <b>genomes</b> with large duplications.

5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller <b>genome</b> sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the <b>genome</b> when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the <b>genome</b> is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component <b>genome</b> will incapacitate the entire <b>genome.</b> In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E

The horse <b>genome</b> was first sequenced in 2006, and was fully mapped by 2009.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria contain {{their own}} <b>genome,</b> an {{indication}} that they are derived from bacteria through endosymbiosis.

40|$|The {{complete}} mitochondrial <b>genomes</b> were sequenced in anadromous {{and resident}} {{forms of the}} lamprey Lethenteron camtschaticum. The sizes of the <b>genomes</b> in the two isolates are 16, 245 and 16, 295 [*]bp. The gene arrangement, base composition, {{and size of the}} two sequenced <b>genomes</b> are similar to the lamprey <b>genomes</b> previously published. The total sequence divergence between the two <b>genomes</b> is very low (0. 14 %), supporting conspecificity of the anadromous and resident forms of L. camtschaticum. Comparison of the <b>genomes</b> sequenced in the present work with other <b>genomes</b> of lampreys available in GenBank, reveals two distinct evolutionary lineages with a genera level of divergence among the lampreys of eastern Eurasia...|$|R

T he enormous scale of the inva-sion of vertebrate <b>genomes</b> by viral sequences has become apparent through analyses of complete <b>genomes.</b> Sequences derived from many kinds of RNA (1) and DNA (2) viruses have found a con-venient resting place in host <b>genomes</b> during evolution, and the process is ongoing.

5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA <b>genome</b> and a protein capsid. The <b>genome</b> is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA <b>genome</b> that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short <b>genome</b> and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran {{orangutan}} <b>genome</b> was sequenced in January 2011. Following {{humans and}} chimpanzees, the Sumatran orangutan became the third species of hominid {{to have its}} <b>genome</b> sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species had its <b>genome</b> sequenced. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} lower in Bornean orangutans (P.pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} {{relatively}} short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18). The <b>genome</b> size {{is estimated to}} be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize <b>genome,</b> and about {{the same size as the}} rice <b>genome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} compels <b>genomes</b> to be inherited as indivisible blocks so {{that once}} the least mutated <b>genomes</b> in an asexual population begin to carry at least one deleterious mutation, no <b>genomes</b> with fewer such mutations {{can be expected to}} be found in future generations (except as a result of back mutation). This results in an eventual accumulation of mutations known as genetic load. In theory, the genetic load carried by asexual populations eventually becomes so great that the population goes extinct. In sexual populations, the process of genetic recombination allows the <b>genomes</b> of the progeny to be different from the <b>genomes</b> of the parents. In particular, progeny <b>genomes</b> with fewer mutations can be generated from more highly mutated parental <b>genomes</b> by putting together in progeny <b>genomes</b> mutation-free portions of parental chromosomes.|$|R

5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The <b>genome</b> {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014.

Each individual <b>genome</b> contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

These distributions, which describe the local entropic variability of the <b>genomes,</b> are used for clustering the <b>genomes</b> based on the Jensen-Shannon (JS) distances. The analysis of the JS distances between all <b>genomes</b> that infect the chlorella algae shows the host specificity of the viruses.

5|$|A viral <b>genome,</b> {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a <b>genome</b> that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
