5|$|Batik was {{mentioned}} in the 17th century Malay Annals. The legend goes when Laksamana Hang Nadim was ordered by Malacca King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of serasah cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he made up his own. On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the first version but {{believed that it was}} necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Raël said he {{was given}} the mission of informing the world of humanity's origins in {{anticipation}} of the return of these extraterrestrials by building a residential embassy in neutral territory. He stated that certain mysteries were <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> based on new interpretations of sacred texts such as the Bible. He said that, on 7 October 1975, he was contacted by one of the Elohim, who took him to another planet to meet Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. He stated that his second book, Les extra-terrestres m'ont emmené sur leur planète ("Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet"), relates the teaching he received from these people. In this book, Raël describes harmonious and peaceable beings, who were free of money, sickness, and war.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Herbert de Losinga was {{appointed}} a papal legate in 1093 by Pope UrbanII {{to investigate the}} matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King WilliamII gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation {{for the loss of}} York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King WilliamII and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown HenryI, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July the King met Badoglio – {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had declared to friends that he would organize a putsch {{with or without the}} King – and informed him that he would be the new head of government.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Siddhartha {{left his}} palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha {{was said to have}} seen an old man. When his charioteer Channa <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he {{encountered}} a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome ageing, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.|$|E
25|$|One of the Israeli officials, Eli Hacmon, commented after refereeing {{the match}} between Kilmarnock and Aberdeen that no-one had <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> why the referees were on strike before he {{travelled}} to Scotland. He {{went on to}} say that he would not have provided his services if he had known that the Scottish referees had gone on strike due to criticism. Aberdeen players protested when Hacmon awarded a penalty kick against them during the match, but BBC Sport commented that it appeared to be a simple decision, as goalkeeper Jamie Langfield had impeded Alexei Eremenko.|$|E
25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and he said, ‘Well {{this is a new}} constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E

25|$|Emperor John IV of Trebizond {{was aware}} of the threat Mehmed II posed for him at least as early as February 1451, when the Byzantine diplomat George Sphrantzes arrived in Trebizond seeking a bride for his emperor, Constantine XI. John had happily related to the visiting diplomat the news of the death of Sultan Murad II, and that Mehmed II's youth meant that now his empire could last longer and be blessed. Sphrantzes, however, was taken aback and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Mehmed's youth and seeming {{friendship}} were only ploys, and that Mehmed was more of a threat to both monarchies than his father had been.|$|E
25|$|Zendt {{decides to}} flee Pennsylvania for the Oregon country and {{purchases}} a well-used Conestoga wagon. Before he leaves {{he goes to}} the local orphanage and picks up Elly Zahm (Stephanie Zimbalist), a teenage orphan who is smitten with Zendt. Having witnessed the alleged rape-attempt through a window, Elly {{is one of the few}} people in the county who knows that Zendt is innocent. The pair head west, marrying along the way. Upon reaching Cairo, Illinois, the former Mennonite is forced to sell his prized draft horses. It is <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that they animals would never survive the trail across the Great Plains and that oxen are much better suited, despite being slower.|$|E
25|$|There {{once took}} place a great {{competition}} between the Devas to decide who among them should {{be the head of}} the Gana (the troops of semi-gods at the service of Shiva). The competitors were required to circle the world as fast as possible and return to the Feet of Parvati. The gods took off, each on his or her own vehicle, and even Ganesha participated with enthusiasm in the race; but he was extremely heavy and was riding on a mouse! Naturally, his pace was remarkably slow and this was a great disadvantage. He had not yet made much headway when there appeared before him the sage Narada (son of Brahma), who asked him where he was going. Ganesha was very annoyed and went into a rage because it was considered unlucky to encounter a solitary Brahmin just {{at the beginning of a}} voyage. Notwithstanding the fact that Narada was the greatest of Brahmins, son of Brahma himself, this was still a bad omen. Moreover, it wasn't considered a good sign to be asked where one was heading when one was already on the way to some destination; therefore, Ganesha felt doubly unfortunate. Nonetheless, the great Brahmin succeeded in calming his fury. Ganesha <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> the motives for his sadness and his terrible desire to win. Narada consoled and exhorted him not to despair; he said that for a child, the whole world was embodied within the mother , so all Ganesha had to do was to circle his Parvati and he would defeat those who had more speed but less understanding.|$|E

500|$|In {{attendance}} of Wessel's funeral was Goebbels, who delivered the eulogy, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, Hermann Göring, and Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. Prior to the event, Goebbels and Göring had discussed {{the possibility of}} Hitler attending. In his diary entry {{on the day of}} the funeral, Goebbels recalled: [...] "Hitler isn't coming. Had the situation <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> over the telephone and he actually declined. Oh well" [...] Goebbels blamed Rudolf Hess for preventing Hitler from coming.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with this plural {{use of the}} word, in a 1954 article written by Arnold Field, {{a reporter for the}} Daily Dispatch, Gardner had apparently <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "there are man and woman witches. Each is called a wica." [...] This quote offers the only piece of evidence that Gardner also referred to Pagan Witches individually as a wica. It is possible that Field misunderstood what Gardner was saying by not capitalising Wica, and that therefore Gardner might have never used Wica in a singular sense.|$|E
