40|$|In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for finding a point-by-point (deterministic) attitude solution {{of a vehicle}} using Global Positioning System phase difference measurements is presented. This technique transforms a <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function into a more numerically efficient form by determining three-dimensional vectors in either the body or reference coordinate system. Covariance relationships for the new algorithm, as well as methods which minimize the <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function, are also derived. The equivalence of the <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> function and transformed cost function is shown for the case of orthogonal baselines or sightlines. Simulation results are shown which demonstrate {{the usefulness of the}} new algorithm and covariance expressions.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{consumer}} search with learning in which cost shocks have different short- and long-range effects on prices. In the short run, consumers confuse <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> shocks, common to all firms in the industry, with firm-specific shocks. In {{the case of a}} <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> increase, this promotes an excessive propen-sity to search, restraining the amount by which prices increase in the short run. Conversely, {{in the case of an}} idiosyncratic cost increase, consumers search too little, causing the prices of high-cost firms to overshoot...|$|R
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{historian}} Claude Campbell, John Maynard Keynes [...] "set {{the fashion}} for {{critics of the}} economic aspects of the treaty" [...] and [...] "made probably the severest and most sweeping indictment of its economic provisions". Keynes was temporarily attached to the British Treasury {{during the war and}} was their official representative at the peace conference. He later resigned [...] "when it became evident that hope could no longer be entertained of substantial modifications in the draft Terms of Peace" [...] due to the [...] "policy of the Conference towards the economic problems of Europe". In 1919, he wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace based on his objections. He wrote that he believed [...] "that the campaign for securing out of Germany the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war {{was one of the most}} serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible", and called the treaty a [...] "Carthaginian peace" [...] that would economically affect all of Europe. Keynes said that the treaty's reparation figures [...] "generally exceed Germany's capacity" [...] to pay. He said that [...] was the [...] "safe maximum figure", but even then he did [...] "not believe that [...] pay as much". He said the Reparation Commission was a tool that could [...] "be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment".|$|E

40|$|Operator cost {{partitioning}} is {{a well-known}} technique to make admissible heuristics additive by distributing the operator costs among individual heuristics.

We argue that this requirement is not necessary and demonstrate the benefit of using <b>general</b> <b>cost</b> partitioning. We show that LP heuristics for operator-counting constraints are cost-partitioned heuristics and that the state equation heuristic computes a cost partitioning over atomic projections.

6000|$|In {{any case}} the appeals to {{sentiment}} and fairness outlined above are hollow; for {{it makes no}} difference to the recipient of a separation allowance or a pension whether the State which pays them receives compensation on this or on another head, and a recovery by the State out of indemnity receipts is just as much in relief of the general taxpayer as a contribution towards the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war would have been. But the main consideration is that {{it was too late to}} consider whether the pre-Armistice conditions were perfectly judicious and logical or to amend them; the only question at issue was whether these conditions were not in fact limited to such classes of direct damage to civilians and their property as are set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of Annex I. If words have any meaning, or engagements any force, we had no more right to claim for those war expenses of the State, which arose out of Pensions and Separation Allowances, than for any other of the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war.

60|$|Having {{regard to}} all these considerations, I do not put the money value of the actual {{physical}} loss of Belgian property by destruction and loot above $750,000,000 as a maximum, and while I hesitate to put yet lower an estimate which differs so widely from those generally current, I shall be surprised if it proves possible to substantiate claims even to this amount. Claims in respect of levies, fines, requisitions, and so forth might possibly amount to a further $500,000,000. If the sums advanced to Belgium by her allies for the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war are to be included, a sum of about $1,250,000,000 has to be added (which includes the cost of relief), bringing the total to $2,500,000,000.|$|E
6000|$|Apart {{from other}} aspects of the transaction, I believe that the {{campaign}} for securing out of Germany the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war {{was one of the most}} serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible. To what a different future Europe might have looked forward if either Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Wilson had apprehended that the most serious of the problems which claimed their attention were not political or territorial but financial and economic, and that the perils of the future lay not in frontiers or sovereignties but in food, coal, and transport. Neither of them paid adequate attention to these problems at any stage of the Conference. But in any event the atmosphere for the wise and reasonable consideration of them was hopelessly befogged by the commitments of the British delegation on the question of Indemnities. The hopes to which the Prime Minister had given rise not only compelled him to advocate an unjust and unworkable economic basis to the Treaty with Germany, but set him at variance with the President, and on the other hand with competing interests to those of France and Belgium. The clearer it became that but little could be expected from Germany, the more necessary it was to exercise patriotic greed and [...] "sacred egotism" [...] and snatch the bone from the juster claims and greater need of France or the well-founded expectations of Belgium. Yet the financial problems which were about to exercise Europe could not be solved by greed. The possibility of their cure lay in magnanimity.|$|E

6000|$|But {{there are}} not only the {{limitations}} of the phrase in its natural meaning and the emphasis on civilian damages as distinct from military expenditure generally; it must also be remembered that the context of the term is in elucidation of the meaning of the term [...] "restoration" [...] in the President's Fourteen Points. The Fourteen Points provide for damage in invaded territory--Belgium, France, Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro (Italy being unaccountably omitted)--but they do not cover losses at sea by submarine, bombardments from the sea (as at Scarborough), or damage done by air raids. It was to repair these omissions, which involved losses to the life and property of civilians not really distinguishable in kind from those effected in occupied territory, that the Supreme Council of the Allies in Paris proposed to President Wilson their qualifications. At that time--the last days of October, 1918--I do not believe that any responsible statesman had in mind the exaction from Germany of an indemnity for the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war. They sought only to make it clear (a point of considerable importance to Great Britain) that reparation for damage done to non-combatants and their property was not limited to invaded territory (as it would have been by the Fourteen Points unqualified), but applied equally to all such damage, whether [...] "by land, by sea, or from the air" [...] It was only at a later stage that a general popular demand for an indemnity, covering the full costs of the war, made it politically desirable to practise dishonesty and to try to discover in the written word what was not there.|$|E

[...] This is a well and carefully drafted Article; for the President could read it as statement of admission on Germany's part of moral responsibility for bringing about the war, while the Prime Minister could explain it as an admission of financial liability for the <b>general</b> <b>costs</b> of the war. Article 232 continues: [...] "The Allied and Associated Governments recognize that the resources of Germany are not adequate, after taking into account permanent diminutions of such resources which will result from other provisions of the present Treaty, to make complete reparation for all such loss and damage." [...] The President could comfort himself that this was no more than a statement of undoubted fact, and that to recognize that Germany cannot pay a certain claim does not imply that she is liable to pay the claim; but the Prime Minister could point out that in the context it emphasizes to the reader the assumption of Germany's theoretic liability asserted in the preceding Article. Article 232 proceeds: [...] "The Allied and Associated Governments, however, require, and Germany undertakes, that she will make compensation for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their property during the period of the belligerency of each as an Allied or Associated Power against Germany by such aggression by land, by sea, and from the air, and in general all damage as defined in Annex I. hereto."[104] The words italicized being practically a quotation from the pre-Armistice conditions, satisfied the scruples of the President, while the addition of the words [...] "and in general all damage as defined in Annex I. hereto" [...] gave the Prime Minister a chance in Annex I.|$|E
