2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Lim {{spent a few}} years in Los Angeles, landing roles in Off Limits (1988) and It Could Happen to You (1994). He found the city [...] "very {{cutthroat}} and very fake. I didn't like the obsession with showbiz there. It wasn't like living a normal life in a normal city. I knew it was tough before I went, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> if I stayed any longer my soul would be destroyed. The truth is {{that you had to}} be in the racial majority to get the parts." [...] Lim also confessed that he's [...] "not one for schmoozing. My career would have been severely hampered if I had hung out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris was classically {{trained on}} the violin and piano {{as a child and}} he began playing bass in London pop bands, turning down at one point the {{opportunity}} to play with Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell before Hendrix had struck fame. After several years, Thomas decided that he had little interest in making a career as a performing musician. In a 1998 interview, he stated [...] "I realized that being in a band you were dependent on all these other people, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that if I'd ever been successful in a band, I would've wanted to stay in the studio and just make the records; I wasn't that interested in playing live." ...|$|E
2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that by going that route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized. [...] "I made a commitment to Temple that I {{was going to make it}} and make it right...I never pushed to get it made until now, because now we got it right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early {{drafts of}} the {{screenplay}} were set on Hollywood Boulevard, not Portland, with working titles such as Blue Funk and Minions of the Moon. Reading Rechy's novel had convinced Van Sant {{to change the}} setting to Portland. The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first was called Modern Days and it recounted Mike's story; a second one updated the Henry IV plays with Scott's story. Van Sant realized that he could blend the two stories together {{in the manner of}} the [...] "cut up" [...] technique used by writer William S. Burroughs. In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sant's mind after watching Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight. The director remembers, [...] "I thought that the Henry IV plays were really a street story. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys". Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled the character of Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up becoming a literal restructuring of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always looked like he was about to fall asleep. The film's title is derived from the song [...] "Private Idaho" [...] by the B-52's that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.|$|E

60|$|We bound this beast {{with leather}} thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied its thumbs and big toes together, and gagged {{it with a}} shoe-horn, which makes a very {{efficient}} gag {{if you know how}} to arrange it. Then we carried it into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor, telling him to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath, Strickland said, 'It's no good. This isn't any doctor's work.' <b>I,</b> <b>also,</b> <b>knew</b> that he spoke the truth.|$|E

Frank Malbone was a gentleman himself, and men of that class are always superior to low jealousies; but Frank must know better how to appreciate the feelings of those among whom he had been bred and born than I could possibly {{know how to do it}} myself.

The fight jumped toward us pretty quick, you remember, and while I sat at the wheel the bullet came.

6000|$|... 'Thou seest,' I said, 'they {{have taken}} away the door. Is there aught {{with which we}} may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight.' I spoke thus, because I knew that we must hold this place or none, as there were no inner doors in the palace, the rooms being {{separated}} one from another by curtains. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> {{that if we could}} by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in nowhere else; for the palace is absolutely impregnable, that is, since the secret door by which Sorais had entered on that memorable night of attempted murder had, by Nyleptha's order, been closed up with masonry.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, I am {{thankful to}} say that my powers of {{judgment}} and of action did not forsake me. I knew that it would be folly to attempt to follow my track back again through the intricacies of the forest in so dark a night, especially now that the track was partly mingled and confused with that which I had made in joining it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that to give way to despair, and lie down without a fire or food, would be to seal my own doom.

60|$|As the {{circumstances}} of the murder, gradually unravelling, took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind, I kept them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was possible {{in the midst of the}} universal excitement.

I may further have known, but I believe I did not, when, or about when, the Sessions to which his trial stood postponed would come on.|$|E

60|$|William Makepeace Thackeray {{was born}} at Calcutta, on July 18, 1811. His father was Richmond Thackeray, son of W. M. Thackeray of Hadley, near Barnet, in Middlesex. A {{relation}} of his, of the same name, a Rev. Mr. Thackeray, I knew well as rector of Hadley, many years afterwards. Him I believe {{to have been a}} second cousin of our Thackeray, but I think they had never met each other. Another cousin was Provost of Kings at Cambridge, fifty years ago, as Cambridge men will remember. Clergymen of the family have been numerous in England during the century, and there was one, a Rev. Elias Thackeray, whom <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> in my youth, a dignitary, if I remember right, in the diocese of Meath. The Thackerays seem to have affected the Church; but such was not at any period of his life the bias of our novelist's mind.|$|E
60|$|I {{seemed to}} believe the boy, I didn't know why. Something in me seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my reason didn't. My reason {{straightway}} began to clamor; that was natural. I didn't know {{how to go about}} satisfying it, because I knew that the testimony of men wouldn't serve--my reason would say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence. But all of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck. I knew that the only total eclipse of the sun {{in the first half of}} the sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year--i.e., 1879. So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not.|$|E

Suddenly it occurred to me to draw my knife and cut myself out. To my dismay, I found that my knife had been lost in the struggle when I was swallowed. I was in despair, for you all know, my friends, how impossible it is to cut up a walrus, either from out or inside, without a knife. In my agony I seized the monster's heart, and tried to tear it; but it was too hard-hearted for that. The effort only made the creature tremble and jump, which I found inconvenient. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> from the curious muffled sound outside that it was roaring.
