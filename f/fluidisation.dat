5000|$|<b>Fluidisation</b> is a {{phenomenon}} whereby solid particulate is placed under certain conditions to cause it to behave like a fluid. A fluidized bed is a system conceived to facilitate the <b>fluidisation.</b> Fluidized beds have {{a wide range of}} applications including but not limited to: assisting with chemical reactions, heat transfer, mixing and drying. A recent concept devised and patented by Outotec, [...] "An annular fluidized bed consists of a large central nozzle surrounded be a stationary fluidized" [...]|$|E
50|$|Group B The {{particle}} size lies between 40 and 500 µm and the particle density between 1.4-4g/cm3. Bubbling typically forms directly at incipient <b>fluidisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluidisation</b> {{through a}} one-way {{membrane}} can help compacted material, but are expensive {{and difficult to}} install and maintain. These systems can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanically Fluidised Reactor (MFR). A {{mechanical}} stirrer {{is used to}} mobilize particles and achieve properties similar to that a well-mixed fluidised bed. It does not require <b>fluidisation</b> gas.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, Fritz Winkler {{made the}} first {{industrial}} application of <b>fluidisation</b> in a reactor for a coal gasification process. [...] In 1942, the first circulating fluid bed was built for catalytic cracking of mineral oils, with <b>fluidisation</b> technology applied to metallurgical processing (roasting arsenopyrite) in the late 1940s. [...] During this time theoretical and experimental research improved {{the design of the}} fluidised bed. In the 1960s VAW-Lippewerk in Lünen, Germany implemented the first industrial bed for the combustion of coal and later for the calcination of aluminium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluidisation</b> {{through a}} 1 way membrane. This can help already {{compacted}} material. However they are expensive {{and difficult to}} install and maintain. They can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging.|$|E
50|$|Stationary or {{bubbling}} {{fluidised bed}} is the classical approach where the gas at low velocities is used and <b>fluidisation</b> of the solids is relatively stationary, with some fine particles being entrained.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} few {{fluidized}} beds were successfully applied into industrial processes, demand for more types of fluidization technology has rose to satisfy the growing industrial demand. The addition of vibratory mechanism to the fluidized bed in 1984 where Geldart showed that using mechanical vibrating sieve can improve the performance of fluidising small size of fine particles. These experiments are difficult to process these powders by <b>fluidisation</b> due to the unpredictable behaviours of particles. It was later found {{that it would be}} cheaper and more environmentally friendly by adding vibration into the fluidization process. This was then used as a starting point by many others for further fluidization research based on the effects of vibrations. Mujumdar (1988) devised two methods using vibration technic of fluidization for fluidizing hot-sensitive and paste-like materials. Yoshihide et al. (2003) studied the effect of vibration on <b>fluidisation</b> behavior and prediction of minimum <b>fluidisation</b> velocity. Kaliyaperumal et al. (2011) determined the effect of different vibration to the nano and sub-micro particles, those particles are hard to fluidise in the absence of mechanical vibration and have special properties.|$|E
50|$|Fluidization (or <b>fluidisation)</b> is {{a process}} similar to {{liquefaction}} whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{the minimum}} <b>fluidisation</b> {{velocity}} (...) , the bed material will be suspended by the gas-stream and further {{increases in the}} velocity will have a reduced effect on the pressure, owing to sufficient percolation of the gas flow. Thus the pressure drop for [...] is relatively constant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fluidisation</b> of {{the solid}} bed in the {{carbonator}} is achieved by passing the flue gas through the bed. In the calciner, some of the recovered CO2 is recycled through the system. Some oxygen may also be passed through the reactor if fuel is being burned in the calciner to provide energy.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimise}} {{the effects}} of clogging and particle build-up a back flushing system must accommodate approximately 1-5% of the bulk flow as back flush, operating at approximately 6-8 bar. Beyond this range particulates may become fragmented making them difficult {{to be removed from}} the system, and potentially cause <b>fluidisation</b> of the system.|$|E
50|$|Blocks {{are nearly}} always angular to sub-angular and roughly equidimensional. If the parent rock is flow-foliated lava, {{sedimentary}} material or schistose metamorphic rocks, the blocks {{may have a}} plate-like or slab-like form. In other cases, blocks derived from great depths may resemble polished water-worn pebbles and are cobbled due to <b>fluidisation</b> and upwards transport.|$|E
50|$|Group A For {{this group}} the {{particle}} size is between 20 and 100 µm, and the particle density is typically less than 1.4g/cm3. Prior to {{the initiation of}} a bubbling bed phase, beds from these particles will expand {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3 at incipient <b>fluidisation,</b> due to a decreased bulk density. Most powder-catalyzed beds utilize this group.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{phenomenon is}} called <b>fluidisation.</b> Fluidised beds {{are used for}} several purposes, such as fluidised bed reactors (types of chemical reactors), fluid catalytic cracking, fluidised bed combustion, heat or mass transfer or interface modification, such as applying a coating onto solid items. This technique is also becoming more common in aquaculture {{for the production of}} shellfish in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems.|$|E
50|$|Group D The {{particles}} {{in this region}} are above 600 µm and typically have high particle densities. <b>Fluidisation</b> of this group requires very high fluid energies and is typically associated {{with high levels of}} abrasion. Drying grains and peas, roasting coffee beans, gasifying coals, and some roasting metal ores are such solids, and they are usually processed in shallow beds or in the spouting mode.|$|E
50|$|John Frank Davidson {{was born}} in Newcastle upon Tyne, the {{industrial}} centre of the county of Northumberland. His school years (1937-1944) fell on severe days of World War II. In 1944, he entered the University of Cambridge, with which all his further life has been associated. After receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1947, Davidson joined Rolls-Royce in Derby, where he served {{two and a half}} years in the Mechanical Development Department. Having returned in 1950 to Cambridge, he became a graduate student in the Engineering Department (1950-1952). At the end of 1952, he passed to the recently founded Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Cambridge. In that period, Davidson began to theoretically study the motion of large gas bubbles in liquids and wrote his still widely cited works on the mass transfer between a bubble and a liquid flowing past it. However, what is more important, these studies stimulated him to carry out a number of pioneering works on <b>fluidisation,</b> which were generalised in his book Fluidised Particles(1963), written with David Harrison (later, this book was translated into Russian). This was one of the first books on <b>fluidisation,</b> and it generated keen interest.|$|E
50|$|In {{fluidised}} beds, {{the contact}} {{of the solid}} particles with the <b>fluidisation</b> medium (a gas or a liquid) is greatly enhanced when compared to packed beds. This behavior in fluidised combustion beds enables good thermal transport inside the system and good heat transfer between the bed and its container. Similarly to the good heat transfer, which enables thermal uniformity analogous {{to that of a}} well mixed gas, the bed can have a significant heat-capacity whilst maintaining a homogeneous temperature field.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the packed}} bed has a fluid passed over it, the {{pressure}} drop of the fluid is approximately {{proportional to the}} fluid's superficial velocity. In order to transition from a packed bed to a fluidised condition, the gas velocity is continually raised. For a free-standing bed there will exist a point, known as the minimum or incipient <b>fluidisation</b> point, whereby the bed's mass is suspended directly by {{the flow of the}} fluid stream. The corresponding fluid velocity, known as the [...] "minimumfluidisation velocity", [...]|$|E
50|$|An {{expanded}} granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor is {{a variant}} of the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion (UASB) concept for anaerobic wastewater treatment. The distinguishing feature is that a faster rate of upward-flow velocity is designed for the wastewater passing through the sludge bed. The increased flux permits partial expansion (<b>fluidisation)</b> of the granular sludge bed, improving wastewater-sludge contact as well as enhancing segregation of small inactive suspended particle from the sludge bed. The increased flow velocity is either accomplished by utilizing tall reactors, or by incorporating an effluent recycle (or both). A scheme depicting the EGSB design concept is shown in this EGSB diagram.|$|E
50|$|Vibratory {{fluidized}} bed {{technology has been}} around since its first discovery in 1984 by Geldart, where he conducted an experiment to observe the behaviour of different types of particle groups behave when vibration mechanism are introduced to further fluidized the particles. Although it has been around for the past 20 years, only a few research has been done to further improve this technology. Recently, the world is focusing on environmental friendly machinery for the sustainability of the earth. Therefore more research has been conducted to study the effect of vibration in <b>fluidisation</b> because not only vibratory {{fluidized bed}} is environmental friendly, it is also cheaper compare to other fluidized bed.|$|E
50|$|When magma {{comes into}} contact with wet {{sediment}} several processes combine to produce the mixture of sedimentary and igneous clasts which is characteristic of a peperite. These processes are required to produce both the disintegration or fragmentation of magma to form juvenile clasts and the mingling of these clasts within the sediment. Mechanisms proposed for the fragmentation of the magma include; fracturing due to the stresses associated with quenching, autobrecciation due to continuing flow in the cooling magma, pore-water steam explosions and magma-sediment density contrasts. The main mechanism suggested for mingling of the igneous clasts with the sediment is <b>fluidisation,</b> {{in the sense of}} particle support and transport by a fluid.|$|E
50|$|Davidson's works made an {{important}} contribution {{to the development of the}} hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidised bed and the heat transfer in a fluidised bed and also to the creation and implementation of methods for lignite combustion in a fluidised bed. Davidson received the degree of PhD in 1953 and the degree of Doctor of Science in 1968 at the University of Cambridge. In 1974, for works on two-phase flows and, first of all, for achievements in <b>fluidisation,</b> he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in chemical engineering (He elected as a Vice-President, Royal Society of London, 1989). In 1974-1975, he was a member of the Court of Enquiry for the Flixborough disaster.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the {{reservoirs}} at Keldgate {{were added}} to with the installation of a water treatment works adjacent to the west; the plant had a capacity of 90 ML/d and was supplied with water from the main four local extraction boreholes (Springhead, Keldgate, Cottingham, Dunswell). Treatment facilities included ultrafiltration, mofification of plumbosolvency, disinfection and chlorination. The works were designed with an architectural style intended to mimic a local brick and pantile built building. Due to rising levels of nitrate contamination of the groundwater an ion-exchange nitrate removal plant was added in 2009 with a capacity of 33 ML/d; the plant used a rotating schedule of 20 de-nitrating reactors (14 online, 6 in stages of regeneration) with the ion exchange media regeneration phased including an initial backwash <b>fluidisation</b> stage, followed by countercurrent ion-exchange resin recharge.|$|E
50|$|Filter {{selection}} is reliant {{on a number}} of variables such load, duration, shape, size and distribution of the substance desired to be filtered. Ideally if the medium is too large, filtrate will be of a poor quality as it will fail to collect particulates within its matrix. Conversely if the medium is very small, solids will accumulate {{on the surface of the}} cartridge causing close to immediate blockages. In regards to the shape using grains that are round in shape have the tendency to erode due to the pressure the inlet stream may possess on the system, whereas grains that are flat (may increase surface area) however may float out of the system during backwash. Particles which are high on Moh’s scale of hardness and have a relatively large specific gravity are often recommended to be used as particle media. The softer and lighter the material is, the more susceptible it is to erosion and <b>fluidisation.</b> Thus particles such as silica and sand are often used as they are affordable however are resistant to the high flows of the incoming fluid.The uniformity coefficient is a measure of the uniformity of the material used within the filter. It is a ratio of a sieve pore that allows 60% of the material through in comparison to a pore size that allows 10% of material through. The closer the ratio is to one, means the closer the particles are in size. An ideal system would have a coefficient between 1.3 and 1.5 and must not exceed 1.7. Anything less than 1.3 is an indication that it is unnecessary to the system and may result in higher costs without providing any additional form of optimisation. Beyond 1.5 indicates that the system may experience a greater pressure drop and as mentioned may result in clogging, seeping of waste flow and reduced filtration rate.As a guideline it is recommended that the smallest particles used within depth filters should be placed at least 150 mm from the outlet stream to prevent <b>fluidisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The bottom {{section of}} the riser is narrowed to avoid solids from accumulating in the bottom section. Instead of the riser walls being smooth it is {{generally}} composed of membrane waterwall surfaces, this added feature influences the solid flow patterns in the vicinity, hence influences mixing and gas-solid mixing.The riser exits are divided into two types; “once through exits” which involves the exits being smoothly curve or tapered. This exit allows a large net circulation and is optimal for short uniform residence {{time as well as}} quickly decaying catalysts. The other exit is “internal reflux exits” which is an abrupt exit causing a substantial amount of entrained solids being internally separated from the gas reaching the top of the reactor.The cyclone {{is an integral part of}} an annular fluidized bed, particular sized particles are separated by varying the velocity of feed gas. Consequently, at high velocity gas provides enough kinetic energy to separate particles from the fluidized bed. The feed gas and small particles fly into a cyclone separator and there the feed- gas and particles are separated. In turn, particles can be returned or removed to the bed depending on the size of the particle. The entrained solids are captured and sent back to the base of the riser through a vertical standpipe.The large central nozzle is the main component of the Annular Fluidized bed and this differentiate itself from other fluidized beds. The central nozzle is surrounded by a stationary fluidized bed and “due to moderate primary gas <b>fluidisation</b> of the annulus, the solids overflow at the upper edge of the central nozzle” which is then transported and mixed in the mixing chamber by a high upward velocity central secondary gas stream.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} swash-ground water {{interactions}} have given prominance to infiltration of swash and backwash into unsaturated sand {{as the principal}} mechanism explaining sedimentation patterns in the inter-tidal zone. Here we consider the role of <b>fluidisation</b> in explaining such sedimentation patterns. It appears that <b>fluidisation</b> due to general ground water outflow from a beach is insufficient to induce <b>fluidisation</b> of surface sand. We propose a different mechanism for explaining <b>fluidisation</b> whereby very small amounts of swash infiltration into the seepage face cause rapid increases in pore water pressure below the beach surface. During the backwash, pressure unloading on the surface causes rapid ground water outflow from the surface sediment. The rate of this outflow is shown, using a simple model, to be sufficient to induce <b>fluidisation.</b> We also consider a model of general beach ground water behaviour and conclude {{that it can be}} satisfactorily used to provide boundary conditions for smaller scale models of <b>fluidisation</b> under swash. ...|$|E
40|$|Adding lactose fines to a {{dry powder}} inhaler (DPI) {{formulation}} is hypothesised {{to increase the}} tensile strength of the powder thus resulting in higher <b>fluidisation</b> energy and consequentially in improved drug delivery.

40|$|AbstractUsing DEM simulations, {{the paper}} {{examines}} {{the different types}} of behaviour as the gas velocity is increased to cover the complete range from fixed bed to homogeneous expansion, bubbling, turbulent and fast <b>fluidisation.</b> The paper highlights the transitions between the various regimes. At minimum <b>fluidisation</b> velocity, Umf, the structure of the bed is isostatic. When the gas velocity U is increased the system immediately breaks up into large clusters of contacting particles which gradually disintegrate with further increases in gas velocity until, at minimum bubbling velocity, Umb, the first bubbles start to appear.

40|$|Softening at {{drinking}} water treatment plants is often realised by fluidised bed pellet reactors. Generally, sand {{is used as}} seeding material and pellets are produced as a by-product. To improve to sustainability, research {{has been carried out}} to replace the seeding material by re-using grained and sieved calcite pellets as seeding material. An explicit <b>fluidisation</b> model is developed to predict the fluid bed state in fluid bed pellet softening reactors with calcite as seeding material. The <b>fluidisation</b> theory is extended in a model whereby soft sensors are derived and experimentally tested {{for a wide range of}} seeding material and pellets. With the soft sensors porosity, particle size and pressure drop can explicitly be calculated. Pilot research has been carried out to calibrate and full-scale experiments to validate the <b>fluidisation</b> models. Four different <b>fluidisation</b> models were reviewed from which the original Richardson-Zaki fluid bed model has been selected as the best explicit <b>fluidisation</b> model to predict the porosity, particle size and pressure drop. Applying a discretisation model for the fluid bed pellet reactor, the current operation of the treatment softening can be improved by estimating the <b>fluidisation,</b> pressure drop behaviour and particle profile. Waternet can apply the Richardson-Zaki fluid bed model in practice for building a soft sensor to achieve optimal bed fluid conditions for the softening process.

40|$|Vacuum {{fluidised}} beds have {{a distinct}} advantage of being operated with reduced mass consumption of the fluidising media. However, a low quality of <b>fluidisation</b> reduces the opportunity to utilise the bubbling regime in vacuum fluidised beds. <b>Fluidisation</b> maps are often used to depict the interface between the quiescent, bubbling and slugging regimes inside a fluidised bed. Such maps have been obtained by visual observations of the <b>fluidisation</b> interface in transparent fluidised beds. For beds which are visually inaccessible <b>fluidisation</b> maps are difficult to obtain. The present work therefore attempts to model the interface travel in a vacuum fluidised bed. The pressure gradient due to the bed weight has been determined to be a main contributor for fluidisation/defluidisation under vacuum. A simple analytical model based on the pressure gradient (PG model) is developed to predict the interface location in a vacuum fluidised bed. For a segregated bed, the Gibilaro-Rowe (GR) model is modified and used to predict the jetsam layer growth along with the <b>fluidisation</b> interface. The predictions are compared with the experimental data for minimally and highly segregated particles and it is seen that for non-segregated powders the predictions are quite accurate. Lack of sufficient knowledge of bubble characteristics, however, impeded accurate prediction of the jetsam growth especially at high flow rates. However, an approximate complete <b>fluidisation</b> interface is successfully predicted using the GR-PG model. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|Subsurface {{sediment}} remobilisation {{and subsequent}} extrusion records {{the release of}} overpressure through a sealing lithology by an injecting slurry. This investigation focuses upon injections occurring in the shallow-subsurface and utilises a multidisciplinary approach to reappraise the dynamics of sand injections {{across a variety of}} scales. The study provides detailed analysis from the laboratory and field on three scale of form: centimetre-scale <b>fluidisation</b> pipes, metre-scale extrusions and decimetre-scale <b>fluidisation</b> pipes. The investigation has helped bridge the knowledge-gap and converge ideas between traditional geologically-derived interpretations of sand injections and <b>fluidisation</b> pipes considered in chemical engineering. Laboratory modelling of <b>fluidisation</b> pipes provides the first processbased model of shallow sub-aqueous sand injection and extrusion in cohesionless sediments and recognises a series of processes hitherto unlinked to previously described internal sedimentary structures in <b>fluidisation</b> pipes. <b>Fluidisation</b> is shown to occur through a series of discrete phases and critically, the style, stability and temporal evolution of piping, along with flow velocity and concentration, are shown to exhibit considerable variability. The novel application of particle tracking velocimetry to active sand injections suggests that this technique could be invaluable in unravelling the flow dynamics in active injections. A process-based mechanism of sand extrusion formation is proposed though investigation of the internal architecture of seismically-induced sub-aqueous sandstone extrusions. Sand sheets are shown to form through deposition from gravity currents when multiple vents extrude coevally, whereas sand mounds or volcanoes will form from a single vent unless bypassing mechanisms such as channelisation influence sediment deposition. Previous estimate of flow velocity in sandstone intrusions and Reynolds numbers are shown to be inaccurate by up to two orders of magnitude. The investigation also demonstrates that sandstone-hosted intrusions exert control on basinal fluid flow in a manner previously identified only in mudstone-hosted intrusions and proposes a new model of the formation of the sandstone intrusions in Kodachrome Basin State Park...|$|E
