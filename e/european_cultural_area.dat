Typical is strong ecouragement of democracy and democratic values. Their opinion is that every state {{has the right to}} decide whether he wants to {{become a member of the}} European Union or not. They also oppose exclusion of Russia out of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area.</b> In the longer term they believe that possibility to create united Slavic community without Russia's dominance is Russian integration into Europe and the EU as well as all other Slavic countries.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} no lack of {{intensive}} effort to find ways for the Inuit into a largely self-designed future, {{and to help them}} with a recollection of their own values and of their personal identity. It was important in this context to convey a new role of men and women. In the past, the man was responsible for family life and survival, while the women in the camp were charged with the young. Now often both of them have to master new tasks, thereby skipping several stages of development, with this process taking a course different from what happened in the <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area.</b> It is not seldom that the woman assumes the sole role of the breadwinner, while the man is unemployed.|$|E

5000|$|Theatre Biennale New Plays from Europe / [...] is {{the only}} {{large-scale}} international festival dedicated exclusively to productions of contemporary plays in their original languages. They are presented with a simultaneous translation into German. The focus is on authors and their texts. The festival program ideally aims to provide {{a reflection of the}} most pressing topics that Europe is faced with: conflicting national characteristics and idiosyncrasies, diverse interpretations of European identity as well as questions of isolation and self-assertion. Being exposed to different views on familiar occurrences and gaining new perspectives on the concept of European identity ideally lead to an improved understanding of the cultural differences unique to each European country. This festival aspires to function as an impetus and pave the way towards a united, multifaceted and heterogeneous <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area</b> - challenging, critical and tolerant. Expectations are thwarted and viewing habits are challenged: it is a “continuous attack against stereotyped thinking” as Christine Wahl wrote in the magazine Theater heute on the festival’s accomplishments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{image of}} the European culture is given by the {{association}} of the concepts people – culture – history – territory, which provides certain local features. From this relation, we identify a cultural area with local, regional and national features beyond a certain European culture. Thus, we identify at least two cultural identity constructions on the European level: a culture of cultures, that is a cultural area with a particular, local, regional and national strong identity, or a cultural archipelago, that is a common yet disrupted cultural area. Whatever the perspective, {{the existence of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area</b> cannot be denied, although one may speak of diversity or of “disrupted continuity”. The paper is a survey on the European cultural space in two aspects: 1. Europe with internal cultural border areas; 2. Europe as external cultural-identity border area. From a methodological point of view, we have to point out that despite the two-levelled approach the two conceptual constructions do not exclude each other: the concept of “culture of cultures ” designs both a particular and a general identity area. The specific of the European culture is provided precisely by diversity and multiculturalism as means of expression on local, regional, or national levels. Consequently, the <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area</b> is an area with a strong identity on both particular and general levels...|$|E

40|$|European {{cultural}} identity reflects both {{the image of}} homogeneity and that of cultural diversity. This double perspective gives the integration process a complex dimension which makes us take into consideration not only the European unitary ensemble but also the local, regional, or national structures. “Identity revenge”, “the feeling of return to historic, national and {{cultural identity}}” are terms that ask for redefining the national and European identity space that was forced to open to the new geo-political, historical and cultural configurations. Beyond any approach, {{the image of the}} European culture is provided by the association of the concepts people – culture – history – territory. They confer a certain local specificity due to their characteristics. From this point of view, we can identify besides a European culture, a cultural area of local, regional and national specifics. Thus, we identify at least two cultural identity constructions on the European level: a culture of cultures, that is a cultural area with a strong identity on the particular, local, regional, or national levels, or a cultural archipelago, that is a joint yet disrupted cultural area. Irrespective of the perspective, we cannot deny the existence of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>area,</b> whether a diversity cultural area, or one of “disrupted continuity”. Cultural diversity, pluralism and multiculturalism are elements specific to the European area. The European integration process is complex; it does not impose and is not conditioned by the idea of cultural unity, or the existence of a common culture including all Europeans. Specificity and diversity are precisely the means of intercultural dialogue between European peoples. Each European society has to find their own integrating solutions depending on traditions and institutions. ...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{a common}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The {{idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage more problematic. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism?

40|$|The vague {{concept of}} a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. The use of the concept in academia constructs a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage as a category in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines. Thus, {{the use of the}} concept can be considered as scholarly engineering of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. To {{be able to have a}} scholarly discussion about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, the meanings and uses of the concept need to be clarified. This article examines the meanings and uses of the concept in recent scholarly articles published in various disciplines.
