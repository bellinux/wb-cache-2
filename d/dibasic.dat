5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan {{to suggest that it}} is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted <b>dibasic</b> cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, <b>dibasic,</b> and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
25|$|Two or more equilibria {{can exist}} {{at the same}} time. When this is so, {{equilibrium}} constants can be ascribed to individual equilibria, {{but they are not}} always unique. For example, three equilibrium constants can be defined for a <b>dibasic</b> acid, H2A.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the formal}} rules for naming {{inorganic}} compounds, the name for [...] is aluminium acetate, though more formal names like aluminium(III) acetate and aluminium ethanoate are acceptable. [...] The use of the [...] "tri" [...] multiplying prefix in the name aluminium triacetate, while not technically required, is regularly used to avoid potential confusion with related compounds with hydroxo ligands. [...] Basic aluminium diacetate, formally hydroxyaluminium diacetate (CAS RN 142-03-0), has composition [...] with one hydroxo ligand in place of an acetate ligand, and <b>dibasic</b> aluminium monoacetate, formally dihydroxyaluminium acetate (CAS RN 7360-44-3), has composition [...] with only one acetate ligand. [...] These three compounds are distinct in the solid phase but are usually treated as a group and described collectively as aluminium acetate in solution, due to the triacetate hydrolyzing to a mixture which includes the other two forms. [...] The abbreviation as AlAc, along with variants like [...] and , are sometimes used in the discipline of geochemistry, though these are inconsistent with standard practice in mainstream chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of <b>dibasic</b> acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E
