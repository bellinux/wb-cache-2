50|$|The {{aircraft}} possessed {{an exceptionally}} clean finish, being of wooden construction with plywood- and fabric-covered wings and a plywood-covered fuselage. These features enabled the Baladin {{to attain a}} maximum speed of 158 mph on a 90 h.p. engine.

50|$|Thin sheet metals {{are often}} flanged to produce edge-flange or corner-flange welds. These welds are {{typically}} made without {{the addition of}} filler metal because the flange melts and provides all the <b>filler</b> needed. <b>Pipes</b> and tubing {{can be made from}} rolling and welding together strips, sheets, or plates of material.|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 22 March 2008, Abbott had a {{spectacular}} 100+mph crash in the Rob Austin Racing Ginetta G50 {{in the opening}} round of the 2008 British GT Championship at Oulton Park. After being tagged by Peter Snowdon's Aston Martin Abbott struck the barriers {{on the outside of}} the circuit between Old Hall and Cascades corners at unabated speed. The car flipped several times end over end, clearing the safety barriers, before coming to rest upside down where it burst into flames. The fire was caused by the roof skin being ripped off in the force of the accident, in the process this also ripped off the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipes</b> from the fuel tank. As it was near the beginning of the race the fuel tank was near full, when the car came to rest upside down the fuel load leaked quickly into the car.|$|R
50|$|The T 3s had a {{wet steam}} engine with two {{cylinders}} {{that drove the}} centre coupled axle. The slide valves were worked by an outside Allan valve gear. The water supply was stored in a well tank between the frame under the boiler; the coal bunkers were {{on the left and}} right hand side of the firebox. In front of each one was a <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> for the water tank.|$|E
5000|$|... A {{mechanical}} seal {{would most likely}} be created out of an annular elastomeric material through which the nozzle must pass during refueling, preventing vapors from escaping alongside the nozzle. A liquid seal is created by {{the design of the}} <b>filler</b> <b>pipe,</b> which creates a seal with the liquid flowing into the tank. Since the liquid fills the entire pipe, no emissions can escape during refueling. A liquid seal is usually used for smaller vehicles, while the {{mechanical seal}} is used for larger vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the <b>filler</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R

As to the tobacco, she was perfect mistress of the subject; and her lighting of the pipe, with a wisp of paper, when the Carrier had it in his mouth--going so very near his nose, and yet not scorching it--was Art, high Art.|$|R
50|$|Road debris {{can also}} cause other more {{specific}} problems and damage to vehicles. Rocks striking the catalytic converter can cause the internal mat to break and clog the converter. Several recalls have occurred due to road debris. The 2005 Scion TC's wind deflector was recalled because of potential shatter from road debris impact. The 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor was recalled in February 2010 when {{it was determined that}} a mixture of road salt and road debris (mud) might be trapped between a reinforcing bracket and the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipe,</b> causing corrosion. The 2001 Chevrolet C/K chassis cab truck was also recalled on discovery that road debris could strike and damage its pressure relief valves.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{different}} types of fuel have specially sized of nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps {{is supposed to be}} larger so that it cannot fit into the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles. Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the fill pipe on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [...] "mis-fueling". Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{tank was}} carried via two {{transport}} belts and padded back. It {{was composed of}} two cylinders. Each was divided internally into two parts by a metal diaphragm. The two upper sections were linked together and could hold 6 litres of nitrogen at 20 atmospheres, which acted as a propellant. The lower halves were also connected and contained 12 litres of fuel, a mixture composed of 9 parts diesel oil and 1 part gasoline. Both substances were loaded from special openings on {{the upper end of}} the cylinders, where a manual valve conveyed the liquid nitrogen in the tank to pressurize them at the moment of use. The <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> coupling of the lance was located in the lower part of the tank, beside the right cylinder.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a fuel <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> is based solely on experience and physical experiment. The challenge lies in designing the pipe to fulfill the customer needs. In other words designing the pipe such as the fuel flow does not splash back on the fuel dispenser causing a premature shut off. To improve this “trial-and-error” based development a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the refueling process is investigated. In this thesis a CFD model has been developed that can predict the fuel flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b> Worst case scenario of the refueling process is during the first second when the tank is partially filled. The most critical fluid is diesel due to the commercially high volume flow of 55 l/min. Due to limitations of computational resources the simulations {{are focused on the}} first second of the refueling process. The challenge in this project is creating a CFD model that is time efficient, thus require the least amount of computational resources necessary to provide useful information. A multiphase model is required to simulate the refueling process. In this project the implicit volume of fluid (VOF) has been used which has previously proven to be a suitable choice for refueling simulations. The project is divided into two parts. Part one starts with experiments and simulations of a simplified fuel system with water as acting liquid with a Reynolds number of 90 000. A short comparison between three different turbulence models has been investigated (LES, DES and URANS) where the most promising turbulence model is URANS, specifically the SST k-ω model. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the chosen turbulence model. Between the chosen mesh and the densest mesh the difference of streamwise velocity in the boundary layer was 2. 6 %. The chosen mesh with 1. 9 M cells and a time step of 1 e- 4 s was found to be the best correlating model with respect to the experiments. In part two a real fuel filling system was investigated both with experiments and simulations with the same computational model as the chosen one from part one. The change of fluid and geometry resulted in a lower Reynolds number of 12 000. Two different versions of the fuel system was investigated; with a bypass pipe and without a bypass pipe. Because of a larger volumetric region the resulting mesh had 3. 7 M cells. The finished model takes about 230 h on a local workstation with 11 cores. On a cluster with 200 cores the same simulation takes 30 h. The resulting model suffered from interpolation errors at the inlet which resulted in a volume flow of 50 l/min as opposed to 55 l/min in the experiments. Despite the difference the model could capture the key flow characteristics. With the developed model a new <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> can be easily implemented and provide results in shorter time than a prototype <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> can be ordered. This will increase the chances of ordering one single prototype that fulfills all requirements. While the simulation model cannot completely replace verification by experiments it provides information that transforms the {{development of}} the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> to knowledge based development...|$|E
40|$|Premature {{shut-off}} (PSO) of {{the fuel}} dispenser nozzle during automotive fuel tank refuelling {{is considered to be}} a nuisance. PSO occurs when the nozzle stops before the automotive fuel tank is completely full. The physics involved in the PSO process is complex and poses a significant challenge in the design of an automotive fuel tank system. A preliminary study is presented which indicates that a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solution {{of the fuel}} tank filling process for a complete three-dimensional geometry is impractical due to excessive computational time. A hybrid modeling method is investigated to address this problem. In the hybrid model, the fuel tank system is divided into a number of subsystems each with its own specific model. A lumped parameter model is developed to simulate the storage tank and vent tubes while a three-dimensional CFD model is employed to simulate the complex multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe.</b> The lumped parameter model accounts for vapour generation in the tank. The 3 -D multiphase flow model is coupled with the lumped parameter model through the User Defined Function in a CFD program, FLUENT. The model is also modified to consider the effect of tank expansion and that of the variation of tank shape. It is found that the experimental results of multiphase flow in the <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> and the tank dome pressure are well predicted through the CFD simulation using the hybrid modeling method. The tank expansion during the period of fuel filling does not significantly affect the flow field. The variation in tank shape, however, can have a significant influence on the flow field. It is also found that a 72. 0...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the effect of sodium ortho-phenylphenate (SOP) application to in-shell moist peanuts for the control of aflatoxin production. Previous studies showed {{the need to improve}} the SOP solution distribution on peanut pods {{to evaluate the}} product. Thus, in this experiment the place of the spray system was the bag <b>filler</b> <b>pipe</b> of the pre-cleaning machine in the warehouse. In the 1989 rainy season two lots of 120 bags of in-shell moist peanuts were sprayed with 0. 5 and 1 % SOP solutions and aflatoxin production was not controlled. In the dry season of 1989 and in the rainy season of 1990, in-shell moist peanuts were sprayed with 5 % SOP solution. The coverage of pods with the solution was efficient, allowing a uniform distribution of SOP solution on the pods. The results showed that only the 5. 0 % concentration of SOP solution utilized controlled the external fungal growth when a naked eye observation was made, however did not control aflatoxin production when applied to in-shell moist peanuts, probably due to the internal presence of Aspergillus flavus and because the fungicide could not penetrate inside to reach the kernels...|$|E
