5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract.

The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

Students’ Responses <b>on</b> Teachers’ <b>Feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> Academic Writing Class of The Sixth Semester at English Department of Antasari State Institute for Islamic Studies Banjarmasin. Thesis English Education Deparment, Tarbiyah and Teachers Training Faculty. Advisor I : Dr. Hj. Nida Mufidah, M. Pd., Advisor II : Rusnadi, S. Pd. I., M. Pd. I., M. A Keywords : Students’ responses, teachers’ feedbacks, Teaching Writing, Academic Writing Class This {{research}} describes students’ responses <b>on</b> teachers’ <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> academic writing {{class of}} the sixth semester at English Department of Antasari State Institute for Islamic Studies Banjarmasin. Providing feedback is one of teacher tasks in teaching writing. The teacher feedback is significant for students’ progress. The feedback which is given based on students’ expectations will give maximum benefit for student. So, knowing the students’ responses <b>on</b> teachers’ <b>feedbacks</b> {{is very important to}} achieve successful teaching. The research is intended to find out the types of feedbacks which are used by teachers on students’ writing and students’ responses <b>on</b> teachers’ <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> academic writing {{class of the}} sixth semester at English Department of Antasari State Institute for Islamic Studies Banjarmasin. The subject of this research is teachers and students of Academic Writing Class at English Department of Antasari State Institute for Islamic Studies Banjarmasin. The objects of this research are teachers’ feedbacks and the students’ responses <b>on</b> the teachers’ <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> Academic Writing Class in the sixth semester at English Department of Antasari State Institute for Islamic Studies Banjarmasin. To collect the data, the writer uses documentary, questionnaire and interview. Then, all of the data which have been collected are processed using descriptive qualitative. The research result states that there are four types of teachers’ <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> students’ writing; praise, criticism, suggestion and corrective feedback. Students are more interested in having written feedback from teacher in types of suggestion and corrective which focus on the content, organization, language and mechanic. They are mostly interest to have corrective feedback which is given by indicating and categorizing of their error writing and providing correct answer. Based on the research result, researcher suggests students should practice to write continuously and use teacher feedback, all teachers’ writing can develop <b>feedback</b> practice based <b>on</b> students’ responses and English Education Department can consider teachers who will teach writing based on student response to get a successful teaching...|$|R

We also suggest how such systems could be designed and discuss the advantages and limitations of establishing physical models of the global carbon cycle...|$|R
5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done. The developers wanted to focus on how the characters' faces were drawn and animated, {{and make sure that}} the characters matched their respective in-game 3D models, so Fuse gave detailed <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> the layouts, and drew over them in red to indicate what he wanted to be changed. These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the layouts had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in stereoscopic 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E

At the suggestion of a friend, he wrote his first screenplay, Tak Pernah Kembali Sama. With <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo– at the time a film reviewer for a magazine– was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, who asked him to write a script about brownies. The resulting film, a critical success, led to Aristo receiving numerous requests for screenplays, including several adaptations of novels. In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> the anterior pituitary greatly decreases {{the release of}} FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
30|$|It {{serves to}} predict and {{recommend}} {{the items that}} target users might like according {{to the interests of}} their nearest neighbors who share with them the similar behavioral characteristics obtained from the analysis of their behavioral habits [5]. Recent years have witnessed an endless stream of studies and researches on collaborative filtering approaches which can be divided into two categories: neighborhood-based and model-based. Neighborhood-based approaches, further divided into user-based [6] and item-based approaches [7, 8], serve to identify similar users with the target user according to their similarity which is measured by their <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> shared items and then compute predictions based on these similar users’ <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> other items. It is faced with the feedback scarcity that arises in practice because a user may only give <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> a limited number of items, namely data sparsity. Model-based approaches, such as aspect models [9], latent factor models [10], Bayesian models [11], and decision trees, alleviate the feedback scarcity by generating a global model based on the given training data and then using the model to predict the active user’s preference on unknown items, but most of them suffer from high computational overheads caused by the tuning {{of a large number of}} parameters embedded in the models. As a result, it is hard to apply them into large-scale social networks.|$|R

5|$|Initial {{development}} {{began in}} November 2008 when Urban Squall met in San Diego for their annual meeting, 2008's theme was 'a {{game in a}} week'. The team consisted of designer and programmer Andrew Pellerano, programmer Panayoti Haritatos, graphic designer Tim Wendorf and musician Nick Esposito. The developers hired two adjoining hotel rooms and opened the connecting door, allowing them to concentrate solely on creating the game {{over a period of}} five days, resulting in a demo. Pellerano spent further weeks updating the game during his spare time after which it was released to the public. During the weeks between the initial demo version and the game's release, Wendorf playtested the game and provided <b>feedback</b> <b>on</b> the number of souls needed to allow special abilities to be activated. The music track was created one night when Pellerano met Esposito in the latter's studio, during which Pellerano also voiced the sound effects resulting from Cuties being killed.|$|E

URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E

40|$|Tides play an {{important}} role in ice sheet dynamics by modulating ice stream velocity, fracturing, and moving ice shelves and mixing water beneath them. Any changes in ice shelf extent or thickness will alter the tidal dynamics through modification of water column thickness and coastal topography but these will in turn feed back onto the overall ice shelf stability. Here, we show that removal or reduction in extent and/or thickness of the Ross and Ronne-Filchner ice shelves would have a significant impact on the tides around Antarctica. The Ronne-Filchner appears particularly vulnerable, with an increase in M 2 amplitude of over 0. 5 m beneath much of the ice shelf potentially leading to tidally induced <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> ice shelf/sheet dynamics. These results highlight the importance of understanding tidal <b>feedbacks</b> <b>on</b> ice shelves/streams due to their influence on ice sheet dynamics...|$|R
