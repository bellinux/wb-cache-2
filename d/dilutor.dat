International research projects are ongoing to develop dynamic dilution systems from several sources (static cylinders and dynamic generation) to prepare standards at 1 - 100 nmol/mol VOC concentration with an uncertainty < 2 - 7 %. The uncertainty sources for VOC mixtures prepared by a single stage dynamic <b>dilutor</b> are here analyzed. Dilution flow rate, purity of the dilution gas, VOC losses and concentration variability due to imperfect gas mixing, wall-adsorption effects and leaks were considered as influence quantities.

Artificial insemination (AI) is perhaps the biotechnology with greater impact on equine breeding; a stallion can leave hundreds of offsprings over his reproductive life if AI is efficiently used. In some countries, egg yolk is frequently used as part of equine seminal extenders. The egg yolk provides the spermatozoa “resistance factors’’ when it is added. The protective fraction of the egg yolk probably is the low density lipoproteins (LDL). Several studies have reported successful results with the addition and replacement of egg yolk by LDL.

It represents a considerable improvement in terms of speed, accuracy, and simplicity with respect to classical gas stripping methods known as <b>dilutor</b> techniques. Furthermore, range of conditions of its use is larger in terms of: temperatures (from 90 to 600 K), corrosive power, and toxicity of handled compounds. Solutes that could adsorb inside sampling valves or {{on the walls of}} transfer lines between sampling valve and GC detector are now studied easily; thanks to new design and procedure. Activity coefficients of one solute into one solvent at five temperatures, several repeatability tests included, are obtained in worst cases in less than 3 h.

Pui. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 201 pages, appendix p. 198 - 201. To force {{the development and}} use of the best available emission technologies needed to significantly reduce Diesel particulate matter (DPM) mass, the 2007 United States Environmental Protection Agency DPM standards for on-road trucks were reduced by 90 % to 0. 01 g/hp-hr. On-road Diesel engines manufactured after 2007 emit low levels of DPM. The gravimetric method used for certification differentiates between compliant and noncompliant engines at the 0. 01 g/hp-hr level. At concentrations below ~ 10 µg/m 3 the method lacks sensitivity, making it difficult to evaluate alternative engine designs, emission control devices, alternative fuels, and modified lubricants that reduce DPM even further. Alternative methods and metrics like the particle size and number concentration measurements extend this lower limit of detection and may enable engine manufacturers and others to make better decisions on what future technologies are required for meeting a zero emission goal. The objectives of this research are to improve the understanding of variables like dilution and sampling conditions that contribute to particle-based emission measurements, to identify and improve current and emerging methods, and to use alternative methods to make measurements of engine exhaust to further elucidate the impact of fuels, emission control and engine state-of-maintenance on emissions. Additional background information is found in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 is a synthesis and evaluation of ideas and perspectives that were presented at a series of workshops sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council that aimed to evaluate the current and future status of DPM measurement. Measurement of DPM is a complex issue with many stakeholders, including air quality management and enforcement agencies, engine manufacturers, health experts, and climatologists. Adoption of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007 heavy-duty engine DPM standards posed a unique challenge to engine manufacturers. The new standards reduced DPM emissions to the point that improvements to the gravimetric method were required to increase the accuracy and the sensitivity of the measurement. Despite these improvements, the method still has shortcomings. The objectives of this chapter are to review the physical and chemical properties of DPM that make gravimetric measurement difficult at very low concentrations and to review alternative metrics and methods that are potentially more accurate, sensitive, and specific. Particle volatility, size, surface area, and number metrics and methods to quantify them are considered. Although an alternative method is required {{to meet the needs of}} engine manufacturers, the methods reviewed are applicable to other areas where the gravimetric method detection limit is approached and greater accuracy and sensitivity are required. The review suggests that a method to measure active surface area, combined with a method to separate semi-volatile and solid fractions to further increase the specificity of the measurement, has potential for reducing the lower detection limit of DPM and enabling engine manufacturers to reduce DPM emissions in the future. Chapter 3 improves the understanding of variables like dilution and sampling conditions that contribute to particle-based emission measurements by assessing and comparing the nucleation tendency of Diesel aerosols when diluted with a porous wall <b>dilutor</b> or an air ejector in a laboratory setting. A de facto standard air-ejector <b>dilutor</b> and typical dilution conditions were used to establish the baseline sensitivity to dilution conditions for the given engine operating condition. A porous tube <b>dilutor</b> was designed and special attention was given to integrating the <b>dilutor</b> with the exhaust pipe and residence time chamber. Results from this system were compared with the ejector <b>dilutor.</b> Exhaust aerosols were generated by a Deere 4045 Diesel engine running at low speed (1400 rpm) and low load (50 Nm, ~ 10 % of rated). Primary dilution parameters that were varied included dilution air temperature (25 and 47 °C) and dilution ratio (5, 14, and 55). Particle measurements were made at 0. 3, 0. 75, and 1. 0 s to evaluate particle growth in the residence time chamber. Exhaust size distribution measurements made using the ejector <b>dilutor</b> were bimodal with high concentrations of nucleation mode particles. Varying the dilution ratio from 5 to 55 : 1 (with a dilution air temperature of 25 ºC and residence time of 1 s) caused the greatest change in the particle number concentration (4 x 108 to 4 x 1010 particles/cm 3) compared to changes in the other variables. Particle concentration was lower with higher dilution air temperatures and particles were larger in size. Size distributions downstream of the porous tube and ejector <b>dilutor</b> were qualitatively similar in shape. Using a simple dilution model and equations for particle growth in the free molecular regime, particle growth in the two residence time chambers was compared. Model results suggest that dilution in the porous tube dilution system occurs more slowly than in the ejector <b>dilutor.</b> This is consistent with the findings that the particle number concentrations were consistently higher and the geometric mean diameter was generally 1 to 5 nm larger downstream of the porous tube <b>dilutor.</b> Chapter 4 describes the comparison of two methods that are used to separate the solid and volatile components of an aerosol: the thermal denuder (TD) and catalytic stripper (CS). The TD and CS were challenged with atmospheric and laboratory generated aerosols. Laboratory generated particles were composed of tetracosane, tetracosane and sulfuric acid, and dioctyl sebacate and sulfuric acid. These compositions were chosen because they roughly simulate the composition of nanoparticles found in Diesel exhaust The TD method produced semi-volatile particle artifacts due to the incomplete removal of evaporated compounds that nucleated and formed particles and solid particle artifacts that formed during treatment of the aerosol by the TD. Fundamental differences in the performance of the two methods lead to different conclusions regarding the presence or absence, size, and concentration of solid particles in Diesel exhaust. In Chapter 5 the physical and chemical nature of the engine exhaust from a Formula SAE spark ignition engine was evaluated using two competition fuels, 100 octane race fuel and E 85. Three engine conditions were evaluated: 6000 RPM 75 % throttle, 8000 RPM 50 % throttle, and 8000 RPM 100 % throttle. Diluted emissions were characterized using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC). E 85 fuel produced more power and produced less particulate matter emissions at all test conditions, but more fuel was consumed. Chapter 6 demonstrates how exhaust aerosol measurements can be used to diagnose an engine fault in a Diesel engine. A cyclic variation in total particle number concentration was observed while making routine exhaust emission measurements. Many dilution and engine operating conditions were examined and by sequentially shutting down individual cylinders the problem was traced to cylinder 2. The engine was disassembled and piston 2 ’s oil control ring was found to be fractured. Replacement of the ring eliminated the particle concentration fluctuation. This chapter presents the results of experimental measurements made to determine the cause of the irregular emissions. Chapter 7 describes the results of three experiments performed with Continuously Regenerating Traps (CRTs) in a controlled laboratory setting to elucidate the effects of fuel sulfur content, filter age, and storage and release effects on particle concentration. In the first experiment, a new CRT was evaluated using near zero sulfur Fischer Tropsch fuel and low sulfur lubricating oil (420 ppm). The objective was to measure particle emissions from an emission control device that had not previously been exposed to sulfur under a variety of operating and dilution conditions. Next, a used CRT was evaluated using the same fuel and lubricating oil. Finally, the used uncatalyzed Diesel particulate filter (DPF) from the used CRT was replaced with a new, uncatalyzed DPF. The emissions from the used Diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) + new DPF configuration were evaluated and compared to those of the used CRT. Results show that particle number emissions from the new CRTs are 99. 9 % lower than equivalent used CRT data collected on-road at an exhaust temperature of 370 °C. Even as the new CRT temperature was increased to almost 400 °C, emissions levels were still at background levels for roadway aerosol and no nucleation mode was observed. At an exhaust temperature of about 380 °C, the nucleation mode particle number concentration increased sharply and remained high for the duration of the used CRT test. Mass emissions were estimated and found to exceed U. S. EPA on-road standards. The particle number concentration at the start of the used DOC + new DPF evaluation was equal to that measured at the end of the used CRT experiment, suggesting that only sulfates released from the DOC and not the uncatalyzed DPF significantly contribute to nanoparticle formation.

In the work reported here, the capture efficiency of PM in open substrates {{has been investigated}} using PM from a real engine under various flow conditions and sampling settings. The observed capture efficiency (CE) confirmed the expected trends that increased residence time and increased temperature give better CE. However, the volatile content (assumed to be hydrocarbons, HC) can increase the apparent CE due to rapid evaporation and/or shrinkage of the PM. In order to quantify these effects, a conceptual model has been implemented {{that can be used}} as an in situ analyzer of the PM properties. The results show how exhaust treatment (heating and/or dilution) changes the characteristics of the PM. These properties affect CE and can be used for subsequent catalyst optimization. In addition, the method developed here was used to analyze nucleation-mode PM from a special fuel injection strategy. The results revealed that these particles were mainly nonvolatiles, demonstrating the usefulness of this characterization methodology.

Antioxidants exert a protective effect on the plasma membrane of frozen bovine sperm preserving both metabolic activity and cellular viability. Manganese (Mn++) is {{proved to be a}} chain breaking antioxidant in biological system. Therefore, we examined the role of (Mn++) during cryopreservation of cattle bull semen. Semen was divided into four parts and cryopreserved in egg-yolk-citrate extender + glycerol (EYC-G), EYC-G + 100 µM of Mn++, EYC-G + 150 µM of Mn++ and EYC-G + 200 µM of Mn++. After four hours of cooling and 24 hrs of freezing, the spermatozoa were examined for percentage motility, Hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS), LPO and protein leakage. Addition of manganese to the semen during cryopreservation showed a protective effect and accounted for an increase in semen quality parameters [percentage motility, HOS percent and decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and protein leakage]. The effect of manganese on motility and HOS was non-significant (p < 0. 05) in cooled spermatozoa but significant with 150 µM of Mn++ in frozen-thawed spermatozoa. MDA production and protein leakage decreased to a significant and maximum level (p < 0. 05) on addition of 200 µM of manganese.

Substrates were sampled at days 0, 14, and 28, and the results were used to compare 13 indices used or proposed to assess aquatic environmental impact. Sensitivity of the indices to changes in communities with respect to concentration and time was the basis for the comparison. ^ Results indicated that all of the 8 diversity or richness indices tested gave approximately the same result (with the exception of number of species); they increased over the first 2 - 3 concentrations, then declined. Included among these was the Shannon index which gave false positive results, i. e., it increased, indicating enrichment, when in fact perturbation had occurred. This result was due to the disproportionate effect on the most abundant taxa, which caused a more even distribution of individuals among species. Number of species and individuals declined with increased concentration and time, with only one exception in the case of species, indicating perturbation. ^ Results of five community comparison indices were varied at day 14 but by day 28 the results indicated a clear, nearly monotonic, trend due to copper impact. It was assumed that day 28 observations, though probably still changing, were nearer stability than at day 14 and therefore more representative of natural conditions.

40|$|The growing {{need for}} global {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC) data at trace level for industrial applications, domestic and working health, air quality and climate change is driving research towards the preparation of traceable and accurate standards for the VOC amount of substance fraction in gas phase. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has implemented a worldwide VOC monitoring programme, named Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), which data quality objectives refer to an expanded uncertainty lower than 10 % for VOC measurement at amount of substance fractions lower than 100 nmol∙mol− 1. Currently, gaseous standard atmospheres are prepared in high pressure gas cylinders, {{but they do not}} fulfil GAW requirements of accuracy and stability at ppb level, especially for oxygenated VOCs. Dynamic methods are proposed as an alternative to provide a stable amount of substance fraction of the mixture over time.

For this there were used 15 ejaculated of 4 adult dogs. There was evaluated the motility, volume, spermatic concentration and functional integrity of membrane of every ejaculated. Every sample of semen was submitted to 3 methods of addition of the glycerol (Treatment 1, Treatment 2 and Treatment 3) which differentiated for the concentration of glicerol present in the <b>dilutor</b> during the curve of cooling. In the Treatment 1 the whole of the glycerol was added {{to the beginning of the}} curve of cooling, in the Treatment 2 added to himself a fraction of the entire glycerol to the beginning of the curve of cooling and the remaining fraction at the end of the curve, finally in the Treatment 3 the glycerol was added at the end of the curve of cooling. Finished the curve of cooling the semen was packed in straw hats of 0. 5 ml to proceed to the freezing in liquid nitrogen. The progressive motility and the functional integrity of membrane were the parameters used to evaluate the seminal quality to the post-thawing. There was not statistical difference between any of 3 methods of addition of the glicerol, in spite of this the Treatment 1 was keeping lightly better the motility and the functional integrity of membrane (44 % and 46 %) compared to the Treatment 2 (37 % and 36 %) and the Treatment 3 (38 % and 37 %). This demonstrates us that the moment of addition of the glycerol does not influence in a distinguishing way the progressive motility and the functional integrity of membrane being able thanks to this to simplify the process of criopreservación after the glycerol to add to the beginning of the curve of cooling since the semen would not be already manipulated up to the stiff one. TesisEl objetivo del presente trabajo fue evaluar el efecto del momento de adición del glicerol durante la curva de enfriamiento sobre la calidad espermática del semen canino. Para esto se utilizaron 15 eyaculados de 4 perros adultos. Se evaluó la motilidad, volumen, concentración espermática e integridad funcional de membrana de cada eyaculado. Cada muestra de semen fue sometida a 3 métodos de adición del glicerol (Tratamiento 1, Tratamiento 2 y Tratamiento 3) los cuales se diferenciaron por la concentración de glicerol presente en el <b>dilutor</b> durante la curva de enfriamiento. En el Tratamiento 1 el total del glicerol se adicionó al inicio de la curva de enfriamiento, en el Tratamiento 2 se adicionó una fracción del glicerol total al inicio de la curva de enfriamiento y la fracción restante al final de la curva, finalmente en el Tratamiento 3 el glicerol se añadió al final de la curva de enfriamiento. Finalizada la curva de enfriamiento el semen se envaso en pajillas de 0. 5 mL para proceder al congelamiento en nitrógeno liquido. La motilidad progresiva y la integridad funcional de membrana fueron los parámetros utilizados para evaluar la calidad seminal al descongelamiento.

Foram utilizados 12 ejaculados suínos de animais procedentes do setor de Suinocultura - DZO/UFLA. Estes ejaculados foram diluídos e receberam diferentes concentrações de CaCl 2 (A: 0, 0; B: 2, 5; C: 5, 0 e D: 7, 5 mM). As amostras dos ejaculados foram submetidas a três processos de resfriamento (1 : convencional - 15 º C; 2 : lento - 15 º C/ 5 º C; 3 : rápido - 5 º C), sendo que cada ejaculado ficou armazenado por um período de 72 horas para avaliações da qualidade espermática, constituindo os tratamentos experimentais. Os parâmetros seminais avaliados foram motilidade e vigor espermáticos e perfil enzimático da AAT. Houve diferença significativa (P 0, 05).

It was concluded that the adding of CaCl 2 did improve the spermatic motility of the samples of swine ejaculations and that the process of slow cooling is able to replace the standard process without affecting the spermatic quality of semen submitted to cooling. The assessment of AAT is not valid to cooled semen...|$|E
40|$|Soot {{particles}} pose significant {{adverse health}} effects and influence on earth's temperature and climate. Hence, the elimination of soot emissions from diesel engines has attracted a lot of attention. Prior to this work, the investigation of soot oxidation is done mostly under air environment. However, since it is typical for NO 2 {{to be used in}} promoting regeneration under low-temperature soot oxidation for modern DPF, this study focuses on deriving the kinetics of soot oxidation under the influence of NO 2 being a major oxidant. An online aerosol technique of high temperature oxidation-tandem-differential mobility analysis is used with soot being oxidized in a laminar flow reactor at temperature ranging from 500 to 900 &# 8451; with NO 2 concentration from 0 to 600 ppm. The exposure of soot particles to the non-uniform temperature and NO 2 mixing ratio inside the furnace causing NO 2 thermal decomposition is thoroughly accounted for the first time. The soot oxidation rates being calculated as a function of frequency factor Asoot and activation energy Esoot are found to be: Asoot = 2. 4 x 10 - 14 nmK- 0. 5 s- 1 cm 3 molecule- 1 and Esoot = 47. 1 kJ mol- 1. NO 2 oxidation shows significantly lower activation energy when compared to that for O 2 at temperatures below 500 &# 8451;. Even at higher temperature (800 to 900 &# 8451;), the soot oxidation rates with NO 2 is still comparable to that with air. This indicates that NO 2 is a stronger oxidant than O 2 since only parts per million levels of NO 2 are sufficient to cause such significant soot oxidation. After the emissions from diesel exhausts are released into the atmosphere, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are formed from the photo-chemical oxidation of organic vapors and followed by gas-to-particle partitioning. This study aims to advance the understanding of diesel emission influences on SOA formation with a major focus on the photo-oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons inside an environmental chamber that simulates atmospheric chemistry. The investigation through combining the real-time density measurement and other physical/chemical analysis (APM-SMPS, HR-ToF-AMS) demonstrates that mass-based measurement techniques are necessary for interpreting the physical processes (evaporation of SVOCs and condensation of secondary organic compounds) during SOA formation due to the external void space in the agglomerate particles. Analysis of O/C ratio has shown to increase rapidly from 0. 05 to 0. 25 within 12 hours inside the chamber, emphasizing that the multigenerational oxidation of volatile organic vapors from the exhaust to be an important source of SOA formation. The impact of different dilution methods on the diesel particles evolution inside the chamber is investigated for the first time. Lower effective densities and stronger evaporation of semi-volatile species is observed from the intense dilution by the ejector <b>dilutor</b> as opposed to the raw exhaust injection into a full bag inside the environmental chamber...|$|E
40|$|Background: Open filters (with low {{pressure}} drop) have potential for energy efficient reduction of particulate matter (PM) from internal combustion engines. For some applications, open substrates may suffice. Furthermore, {{the use of}} a flow-through filter (e. g. an oxidation catalyst) upstream a wall-through filter (i. e. diesel particulate filter, DPF) will decrease the pressure drop build-up, since smaller particles will be captured in the upstream open filter and a narrower particle size distribution (PSD) with a shift towards larger sizes will enter the DPF. Furthermore, the PM from internal combustion engines is prone to changes (via changes in gas composition and temperature) and it is therefore extremely challenging to characterize. Experimental: In the work reported here, the capture efficiency of PM in open substrates (bare cordierite and alumina-coated cordierite monoliths) has been investigated using PM from a real engine under various flow conditions (varying residence times and temperatures) and sampling settings (dilution ratios) using a DMS 500 from Cambustion. However, the capture efficiency was affected by removal of volatiles (hydrocarbons) influencing both size and numbers. In order to quantify these effects, a conceptual model has been implemented that can be used as an in-situ analyzer of the PM properties. This model includes loss of pure volatile particles and shrinkage of semi-volatile particles. Although physically sound, the model is empirical and the parameters needs fitting to experiments. Results: The observed capture efficiency (CE) confirmed the expected trends that increased residence time and increased temperature gave higher CE. However, the volatile content (assumed to be hydrocarbons, HC) can increase the apparent CE due to rapid evaporation and/or shrinkage of the PM. The results show how exhaust treatment (heating and/or dilution) changes the characteristics of the PM. These properties affect capture efficiency and can be used for subsequent catalyst optimization. In addition, the method developed here was used to analyze nucleation mode PM from a special fuel injection strategy. The results revealed that these particles were mainly non-volatiles, demonstrating the usefulness of this characterization methodology. Furthermore, an equation for diffusion losses in the rotary <b>dilutor</b> for the DMS 500 is presented. 	 Figure 1. Left: The particle size distribution and the corresponding volatile contribution using a sigmoidal function describing the size-dependent fractions. Right: The experimental and fitted capture efficiencies. The conceptual model developed here relies upon the assumption that the experimental setup is reliable and that the theory (provided by diffusion equations and/or correlations) hold for inert particles. In order to verify these assumptions a set of experiments was performed using inert NaCl particles generated by an atomizer (Topas ATM 230). It could be confirmed that the experimental CE corresponded to the theoretical CE. Thus the experimental setup and methodology was validated. Conclusions: Although the evaporation model offers a plausible explanation to the phenomena observed, conclusive validation still remains. However, assuming that this model is applicable, a number of important conclusions could be drawn 1. 	The monolith channel serves as an effective HC trap and thus increases any HC evaporation. The resulting change in PSD should be taken into account when simulating the catalyst reduction in open filters. 2. 	By analysis of the fitted HC contribution, interferences of the PM characteristics can be made in-situ (in terms of volatile content). This information would be very hard to obtain by other means. 3. 	The use of partial injection strategy could be a useful way to produce small PM that is suitable for kinetic studies and for the bridging between lab-scale soot (e. g. Printex U) and real diesel PM emissions. Reference: This work has recently been published online in Industrial & Engineering Chemical Research, DOI: 10. 1021 /ie 4004333...|$|E
