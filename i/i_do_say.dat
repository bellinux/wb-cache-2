He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>say</b> gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

All the people who pretend to take your own concerns out of your own hands and to do everything for you, I won't say they are impostors; I won't even say they are quacks; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>say</b> they are mistaken people. The only sound, healthy description of countenancing and assisting these institutions is that which teaches independence and self-exertion". Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone's secretaries added: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: [...] "It is a lamentable fact if, in {{the midst}} of our civilisation, and {{at the close of the}} nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious {{labourer}} at the end of a long and honourable life. I do not enter into the question now in detail. I do not say it is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>say</b> this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members". On 24 March 1892 Gladstone said that the Liberals had: ...|$|E
