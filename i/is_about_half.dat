5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the gravitational acceleration at {{the surface of the}} Sun (274m/s²).|$|E

More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area.

5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|Styx was {{discovered}} by {{a team led by}} astronomer Mark R. Showalter, using fourteen sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by the Wide Field Camera 3 fitted to the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. Styx <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> as bright as the dimmest previously known object in the system, Kerberos, and about one hundred thousandth as bright as Pluto. It was designated S/2012 (134340) 1, and informally referred to as P5.|$|E
5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) the Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 is a K-type {{star in the}} Sextans constellation. It <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> {{the size}} of the Sun, and has {{approximately}} half the mass. WASP-43 has one known planet in orbit, a Hot Jupiter called WASP-43b. At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun. WASP-43 has also been found to be an active star that rotates at a high velocity.|$|E

The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very strong), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed over 1,100 km2, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below.

The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens.
