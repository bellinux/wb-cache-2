25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E
25|$|We are {{not able}} to see how the {{prohibition}} of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.|$|E

[...] In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time.

[...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E

500|$|He joined York's Conference Premier rivals Barrow on a one-month loan on 23 October 2008, {{having made}} 15 {{appearances}} and scored three goals for York {{up to that}} point in 2008–09. After Brodie scored two goals on his debut for Barrow in a 4–0 away victory Tamworth in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, Barrow's joint-manager Darren Sheridan said [...] "He did well and he gives us more options for the team. It was a great debut from him and we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> still more to come in the next few games". This performance led to him being nominated as Player of the Round for the fourth qualifying round, which was eventually awarded to Sam Hatton of AFC Wimbledon. Barrow revealed that they were hoping to sign him permanently in January 2009 if his loan spell at the club proved successful. He made his league debut for Barrow in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green Rovers and he scored against Gateshead in the Conference League Cup third round for Barrow, the match finishing 3–1 after extra time. It was agreed for Brodie's loan at the club to be extended following the match, but York overturned this decision a day later. He made his final appearance for Barrow in a 1–0 home defeat to Weymouth on 22 November 2008, finishing the spell with seven appearances and four goals. He later ruled out the possibility of rejoining Barrow in January 2009, saying he was committed to York.|$|E
