5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community made repeated unsuccessful attempts {{to end the}} fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington {{to find a way}} to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an arms embargo on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Hassett {{reached his}} century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The {{dismissal}} ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who {{was caught by}} Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The part-time seam bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E

5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought {{the arrival of the}} Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} {{resources}} {{consumed by the}} Neanderthals seems to have remained constant throughout the 100,000 years of their occupation, as did their tools; as they did not face changes to their local environment, they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop new technologies, unlike the northern Neanderthals. This technological stasis is clearly visible from the artefacts found in Gibraltar. The newest Neanderthal tools to have been found there are virtually identical to the oldest, all exclusively being examples of the Mousterian type of flint tools that were first developed around 300,000 years ago. The Neanderthals even used the same hearth in Gorham's Cave for over 8,000 years. Animal bones from the vicinity show that the Neanderthals used the caves for cooking and butchery, as is apparent from the presence of bones which are burnt or have cut marks from Neanderthal stone knives.|$|E

50|$|Gregory Rimini had {{a unique}} take on {{traditional}} nominalist views. He thought that to contrive understanding in physical reality by incorporating abstract objects was nonsensical, {{due to his}} belief that mental objects are used strictly for convenient social conventions and nothing else. With this divide between complex thought and physical reality, Rimini also believed statements describing infinitely many points, infinitely many lines, infinitely many planes, etc. are all false. Since these are all mental, abstract objects, they only exist {{in the minds of}} people who think about them. Thus, the notion of physical infinity is not applicable. Furthermore, God was always in close relation to these abstract objects, too. Rimini's nominalist view claims that God has the ability to distinguish abstract objects but <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> manipulate them. <b>To</b> Rimini, God <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> manipulate mathematical propositions because he exists outside of time and thus, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> think deductively about the individual abstract objects anyway.|$|R
