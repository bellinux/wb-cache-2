5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in frigatebirds {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill,</b> with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{genetic data}} {{suggests}} that <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> and Bycanistes form a clade outside {{the rest of}} the hornbill lineage. They are thought to represent an early African lineage, while the rest of Bucerotiformes evolved in Asia. However, another study claims that the <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> diverged first, followed by Tockus. Within Tockus, two clades have been identified based on genetics and vocal types - 'whistlers' and 'cluckers'. The 'cluckers' have been suggested to form a distinct genus, Lophoceros.|$|R
2500|$|The Africa Savanna exhibit {{opened in}} April 1989 and is [...] in size. This exhibit {{includes}} animals typical of East Africa and includes an aviary and areas for large mammals. These include black rhinoceros, De Brazza's monkey, hippopotamus, bontebok, naked mole-rat, reticulated giraffe, masai giraffe, gerenuk, Speke's gazelle, southern <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill,</b> weaver birds, Cape thick-knee, red-crested turaco, hamerkop, buffalo weaver, hingeback tortoises, and spiny-tailed lizards.

2500|$|This is {{an outdoor}} exhibit {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and {{what is being done}} to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses two South African cheetahs (both males; Gat [...] and Bakari), while the other houses two male Grevy's zebras. Other animals on display in the area include scimitar-horned oryxs, dama gazelles, Rüppell's vultures, sitatungas, red river hogs, maned wolves (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).|$|E

50|$|Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> are not {{a normal}} quarry for {{commercial}} hunters, although they are not uncommon in captivity in zoos. In some areas the species has cultural significance and hunters may tie the severed head and neck of these birds around their necks {{in the belief that}} it helps them stalk their wild ungulate quarry. In some villages the call is often imitated and there are even entire songs based on the male and female duets of Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> are {{believed}} to reach maturity at six to seven years, but very few breed at this age. Nests are almost always deep hollows in very old trees, though there exist reports <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> have on occasions nested on rock faces. One to three eggs are laid {{at the beginning of}} the wet season but siblicide ensures that only one nestling is ever fledged. The eggs measure 73 mm by 56 mm and are pure white in colour but very rough in texture.|$|R

50|$|Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> are preyed on {{by large}} carnivores, such as leopards. Human {{predation}} for food occurs in some countries, including northern Cameroon and Burkina Faso. The nests may be preyed upon by smaller terrestrial predators.|$|R

50|$|The ground {{hornbills}} (Bucorvidae) are {{a family}} of the order Bucerotiformes, with a single genus Bucorvus and two extant species (though possibly including another genus with six extant species). The family is endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa: the Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> occurs in a belt from Senegal east to Ethiopia, and the southern <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> occurs in Southern and East Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is found}} in open {{habitats}} such as savanna, sub-desert scrub, and rocky areas, preferring short vegetation which enables its visual foraging technique. The areas inhabited by this species are usually drier areas than the preferred habitat of the Southern <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill.</b> It will tolerate disturbed areas but does require large trees {{to be used as}} nest sites.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{genetic data}} shows that <b>ground</b> <b>{{hornbill}}s</b> form a clade with Bycanistes, this clade being a sister taxon {{to the rest}} of the hornbill lineage. Bucorvidae are thought to represent an early African lineage, while the rest of Bucerotiformes evolved in Asia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> are large, {{with adults}} around a metre tall. Both species are ground-dwelling, unlike other hornbills, and feed on insects, snakes, other birds, {{amphibians}} and even tortoises. They {{are among the}} longest-lived of all birds, and the larger southern species is possibly the slowest-breeding (triennially) and longest-lived of all birds.|$|R
50|$|Approximately {{eight percent}} of bird species are known to {{regularly}} engage in cooperative breeding, mainly among the Coraciiformes, Piciformes, basal Passeri and Sylvioidea. Only {{a small fraction of}} these, for instance the Australian mudnesters, Australo-Papuan babblers and <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills,</b> are however absolutely obligately cooperative and cannot fledge young without helpers.|$|R
50|$|The Abyssinian <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is found}} in Northern sub-Saharan Africa from {{southern}} Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea east to Eritrea, Ethiopia, north western Somalia, north western Kenya and Uganda.|$|E
50|$|HornbillsThe largest {{species is}} the {{southern}} <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill.</b> It occurs only in nature reserves. Other well-known species include the southern yellow-billed hornbill, the southern red-billed hornbill, the African grey hornbill and the trumpeter hornbill. Hornbills are characterised {{by a large}} downcurved bill which is frequently brightly colored and sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible. They are omnivores, eating both fruit and small animals such as chameleons; the <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill</b> is an adept hunter and will forage in packs, flushing out prey such as locusts, lizards and even tortoises.|$|E
50|$|A prehistoric <b>ground</b> <b>hornbill,</b> Bucorvus brailloni, {{has been}} {{described}} from fossil bones in Morocco, suggesting that prior to Quaternary glaciations the genus was either much more widespread or differently distributed.|$|E
50|$|There are {{gardens and}} a pond with ducks, geese, and swans. Other animals {{at the zoo}} include kangaroos, penguins, river otters, eastern bongos, bald eagles, gray wolves, red pandas, Arctic foxes, bat-eared foxes, meerkats, porcupines, banded mongooses, and {{southern}} <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills.</b> In early 2014, a young orphan moose named Willow arrived.|$|R
5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to <b>ground</b> <b>hornbills</b> or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole.
