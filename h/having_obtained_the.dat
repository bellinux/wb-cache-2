5|$|Fast {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the sixth round (157th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, <b>having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> sixth round pick from the Carolina Hurricanes {{earlier in the day}} in {{exchange}} for defenseman Bobby Sanguinetti. Fast was the fifth of six players the Rangers drafted in 2010, along with Dylan McIlrath, Christian Thomas, Andrew Yogan, Jason Wilson and Randy McNaught. On May 29, 2012, the Rangers announced Fast had been signed to a two-way, three-year entry level contract, valued at $2.145 million, with a $900,000 annual cap hit. Since HV71 was eliminated from the 2012–13 playoffs earlier than expected, Fast had the opportunity to go to the New York Rangers organization sooner than originally planned. The Swedish Hockey League initially voiced objections, but eventually agreed to loan him to the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> Saltwellgate estate, {{the council}} {{contacted}} local ornithologist and landscaper John Hancock {{and asked him}} to submit designs for the new park. When Hancock refused, citing the pressure of his existing work, the park committee retained Edward Kemp at four guineas a day until his plans were submitted and approved in February 1876. Kemp's plans were implemented {{over a period of years}} by borough surveyor James Bowyer at a cost of around £11,000. Original plans to officially open the park on Whit Monday 1876 were not realised, and the park was never officially opened, but nonetheless, public usage began in late 1876.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. <b>Having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E

25|$|<b>Having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> {{intermediary}} {{degree in}} the imperial exams in 1813, Xu Jiyu was initially unsuccessful in advancing in the exam system. In 1826, Xu Jiyu was finally awarded the highest {{degree in the}} imperial examinations and four years later he was appointed to {{a position in the}} prestigious Hanlin Academy. In the academy, he worked {{under the direction of the}} chancellor, Mujangga, with whom he would work closely during following years. In 1836, he became prefect of Xunzhou in Guangxi province. During his tenure as a prefect Xu Jiyu submitted a number of official memorials on domestic reform, which impressed the Daoguang Emperor and further helped Xu to rapidly rise through the ranks of the Qing civil service. Following the outbreak of the First Opium War, Xu was appointed circuit intendant of a coastal prefecture in Fujian province, where he witnessed the war with his own eyes, an experience that convinced him that China needed to learn more about the West.|$|E
25|$|<b>Having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> Shah's concurrence, the CIA {{executed}} the coup. Farmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi (a loyalist who {{had helped}} Reza Shah reunify Iran decades earlier) were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. Having signed the decrees and delivered them to General Zahedi, he and Queen Soraya departed for a week-long vacation in northern Iran. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri, {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot, probably by the Communist Tudeh Party, rejected the firman and had Nassiri arrested. Mosaddegh argued at his trial after the coup that under the Iranian constitutional monarchy, the Shah had no constitutional right to issue an order for the elected Prime Minister's dismissal without Parliament's consent. However, the constitution at the time did allow for such an action, which Mossadegh considered unfair. The action was publicized within Iran by the CIA and in the United States by The New York Times. Mossadegh's supporters (millions of National Front supporters as well as members of the Tudeh Party) took to the streets in violent protests. Following the failed coup attempt, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari and Aboul Fath Atabay fled to Baghdad. Arriving unannounced, the Shah asked for permission for himself and his consort to stay in Baghdad for a few days before continuing on to Europe. After high-level Government consultations, they were escorted to the White House, the Iraqi Government's guest house, before flying to Italy in a plane flown by Mohammad Khatami.|$|E

500|$|The Society People, known {{after one}} of their leaders as the Cameronians, who had not {{accepted}} the restoration of episcopacy in 1660, remained outside of the established kirk after the Revolution settlement, refusing to rejoin an [...] "un-Covenanted" [...] kirk. However, most of their remaining ministers re-entered the Church of Scotland. After years of persecution their numbers were few and largely confined to the southwest of the country. In the period 1714–43 they had only one minister and were unable to form a presbytery and ordain new clergy. Many joined the Secession Church {{in order to avoid}} extinction. In 1743, <b>having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> services of a second minister from the Secession Church, they established themselves as the Reformed Presbyterian Church.

500|$|At {{the home}} of the Bandicoots, Aku Aku senses Uka Uka's {{emergence}} and orders Crash and Coco inside. Aku Aku tells the two that Uka Uka is his twin brother and that he locked in an underground prison centuries ago [...] "to protect the world from his malice". Crash, Coco and Aku Aku go to the Time-Twisting Machine, where Aku Aku gives Crash and Coco the task of recovering the Crystals before Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex do so. Crash and Coco proceed to travel through time and collect the crystals and gems, thwarting Cortex's minions (including Tiny Tiger, Dingodile and Doctor N. Gin) along the way. Doctor Nefarious Tropy is also defeated, throwing the Time-Twisting Machine into disarray. <b>Having</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>the</b> crystals and gems throughout time, Crash eventually faces off against Cortex in the Time-Twisting machine's core while Uka Uka and Aku Aku fend each other off.
