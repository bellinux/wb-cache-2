40|$|Hyperthyroidism is {{a common}} endocrinopathy in cats older than 8 years, with no sex or breed predisposition. Benign adenomas and adenomatous {{hyperplasia}} of the thyroid gland is observed {{in the majority of}} cases. Symptoms reflect the effect of thyroid hormone excess in various systems, with weight loss, polyphagia, polyuria-polydipsia, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities being common clinical manifestations. On clinical examination, there is frequently prominent thyroid enlargement. Common laboratory abnormal findings include increased activity of alkaline phosphatase and alanino-aminotransferase, hyperphosphataemia, azotaemia and decreased concentration of ionized calcium and creatinine. Definite diagnosis of the disease is based on the demonstration of increased blood concentration of thyroid <b>hormones.</b> <b>Measurement</b> of thyroxine concentration, alone or in conjunction with concentration of free thyroxine, is usually sufficient to reach a diagnosis. When diagnosis is uncertain, thyroid stimulating hormone, scintigraphy and dynamic function tests can be used. The possibility of concurrent diseases (e. g., renal failure, diabetes mellitus) must be investigated, as their presence has implications on diagnosis and treatment. Medical therapy, thyroidectomy, radionine therapy and low iodine diet are also valid options for treatment. Each has advantages and disadvantages that a clinician must take into consideration before instigating treatment.

The same tests were repeated with the exception of the APACHE II on day 1, day 3 and day 7. A comparison was made of these variables between the survivors (37 patients) and non-survivors (18 patients). The mean ISS was 35. 1 ± 15. 3 and the mean APACHE II score was 17. 7 ± 12. 0.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{validated}} questionnaire {{for the assessment}} of menopausal syndrome in Chinese Medicine and through the analysis of the basic menopausal syndrome classification in Chinese Medicine to explore the use of objective hormone markers as one of the evidence for the Chinese Medicinal classification and guidance for application of herbal medicines by Chinese Medicine Practitioners. Methods: The major symptoms related to typical syndromes of menopause were extracted from Chinese Medicine textbook, international diagnostic guide of Chinese Medicine, classic and contemporary literature of Chinese Medicine and subjective symptoms were eliminated to facilitate the administrate of a self-reported outcome questionnaire. The symptoms related to menopause in Chinese Medicine were identified and redefined to improve the content validity. A total of 353 menopausal women were included in the study. Participants were assessed through face-to-face interview by registered Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Practitioner to complete the questionnaire and serum samples for <b>hormones</b> <b>measurement</b> were collected after an overnight fast in the morning of the assessment day. Serum Estradiol (E 2), Testosterone (T), Progesterone (P), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA). Free estradiol (fE 2), non-Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin bound Estradiol (non-SHBG-E 2), free Testosterone (fT), and non-Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin bound Testosterone (non-SHBG-T) were calculated to assess hormone availability and activity. E 2 /T ratio was also calculated to investigate the balance of E 2 and T in the body. Results: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted. Symptoms related to Deficiency of Yin and symptoms related to Deficiency of Yang were extracted and the relationship between the syndromes and E 2, T, P, LH, FSH, SHBG, fT, non-SHBG-T, fE 2, non-SHBG-E 2 and E 2 /T ratio were investigated. For symptoms related to Deficiency of Yin, E 2 (p< 0. 000, p< 0. 000), P (p= 0. 004, p< 0. 000), fE 2 (p< 0. 000, p< 0. 000), non-SHBG-E 2 (p< 0. 000, p< 0. 000), E 2 /T (p< 0. 000, p< 0. 000) ，SHBG (p= 0. 039, p= 0. 004) showed significant decrease while LH (p= 0. 013, p< 0. 000), FSH (p= 0. 041, p< 0. 000) showed increase by comparing hormones of mild or little with moderate and severe presentation of symptoms. For symptoms related to Deficiency of Yang, SHBG (p= 0. 042, p= 0. 002, p< 0. 000) showed an increase, fT (p= 0. 044, p= 0. 049, p= 0. 003) and non-SHBG-T (p= 0. 044, p= 0. 049, p= 0. 003) showed a decrease which was significant for other three groups while comparing to the no or little group. Conclusion: Menopausal Syndrome Questionnaire was developed and validated in the study. Major syndromes and symptoms involved in the diagnosis of menopausal syndrome in Chinese Medicine were identified and good test-retest reliability was also demonstrated. From the result, we hypothesize that the presentation of symptoms related to Deficiency of Yin may be closely correlated with the menopausal transition in Western Medicine and the presentation of symptoms related to Deficiency of Yang may be related to deficiency of bio-active T in menopausal women. The study may provide further information on the relationship between reproductive hormones and Chinese Medicinal Classification and provide evidences and guides for effective treatment of menopausal syndrome in Chinese Medicine. published_or_final_versionChinese MedicineMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

We directly compared faecal and plasma <b>hormone</b> <b>measurements</b> {{for the first time in}} a wild free-living species, the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Blood and faecal samples were simultaneously collected from individual penguins for comparison and assayed for testosterone and corticosterone (or their metabolites). Sex differences and variability within each measure, and correlation of values across measures were compared. For both hormones, plasma samples showed greater variation than faecal samples. Males had higher mean corticosterone concentrations than females, but the difference was only statistically significant in faecal samples. Plasma testosterone, but not faecal testosterone, was significantly higher in males than females. Correlation between sample types was poor overall, and weaker in females than in males, perhaps because measures from plasma represent hormones that are both free and bound to globulins, whereas measures from faeces represent only the free portion. Faecal samples also represent a cumulative measure of hormones over time, as opposed to a plasma ‘snapshot’ concentration. Our data indicate that faecal sampling appears more suitable for assessing baseline hormone concentrations, whilst plasma sampling may best define immediate responses to environmental events.

The {{adaptation of the}} Dutch neonatal screening program for congenital hypothyroidism in the mid 1990 s resulted in enhanced detection of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin (CH-C), with high likelihood of multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, including gonadotropin (Gn) deficiency. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed GnRH test results and baseline Gn and sex <b>hormone</b> <b>measurements</b> in 15 infants with CH-C to examine these diagnostic tools for assessment of {{the integrity of the}} hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in young infants. DESIGN: In a nationwide prospective study (1994 - 1996), patients were referred to our department if neonatal CH screening results were indicative of CH-C. When CH-C was confirmed, GnRH tests and baseline Gn and sex <b>hormone</b> <b>measurements</b> took place at the age of 3 months, when euthyroid status had been accomplished by T 4 supplementation, and if necessary, cortisol supplementation was installed. SETTING: The study took place at the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam (referral center). PATIENTS: The study included 15 neonates (five girls and 10 boys) with CH-C, detected by neonatal screening, in whom investigation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis could be performed at 3 months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of GnRH tests and baseline Gn and sex <b>hormone</b> <b>measurements</b> were assessed. RESULTS: GnRH tests at 3 months of age showed a pattern indicative of endogenous GnRH stimulation in nine infants and a blunted response in six. Baseline Gn and sex hormone concentrations except estradiol (P = 0. 053) were significantly different between responders and nonresponders.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{decrease}} the operative time for parathyroidectomy {{in patients with}} hypercalcemic (primary) hyperparathyroid disease, a combination of preoperative localization of a parathyroid tumor with an effective nuclear scan (scintigram) and intraoperative monitoring of parathyroid hormone (quick parathyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>measurement)</b> to ensure excision of all hyperfunctioning tissue was studied. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: For many years, persistent hypercalcemia after parathyroidectomy (3 % to 10 %) has been constant and is usually due to the surgeon's failure to remove all hyperfunctioning glands. A marked decrease in parathormone level after excision of a single large gland predicts operative success {{and a return to}} normal calcium levels. Conversely, persistent high levels of parathyroid hormone indicate excess secretion by another gland(s) and the need for further exploration. Recently Tc- 99 m-sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy was shown to be more effective in localizing parathyroid tumors than previous methods. A combination of both techniques could be useful to the surgeon if they improve the operative success rate and are cost-effective. METHODS: Parathyroidectomy was performed on 18 patients with primary hyperparathyroid disease, with tumors localized by MIBI scintigrams. When excision of the identified parathyroid gland was accomplished, the operation was terminated and quick parathyroid hormone was measured to confirm that all hyperfunctioning tissue was removed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with positive results of scintigram had successful parathyroidectomies confirmed by quick parathyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>measurement</b> with a cervical approach. Two patients with mediastinal tumors localized by MIBI scintigraphy could not be resected using this approach. One false-positive/false-negative scintigram was obtained. Compared with patients having parathyroidectomy without localization and hormone monitoring, the average operative time was shortened from 90 to 36 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Localization and successful excision of parathyroid tumors with confirmation that no other hyperfunctioning glands were present by quick parathyroid hormone monitoring can predict a return to normal calcium levels and a decrease in operative time in parathyroidectomy...|$|R
