This becomes advantageous when one or more inputs is constrained to a small enough range that the results can be stored in a reasonably sized block of memory. Because memory access is essentially constant in time complexity (except for caching delays), any algorithm with a component which has worse than constant efficiency over a small input range can be improved by precomputing values. In some cases efficient approximation algorithms can be obtained by computing a discrete subset of values and interpolating for <b>intermediate</b> <b>input</b> values, since interpolation is also a linear operation.|$|E

Since market power in input purchase has been growing in recent years, it is worth examining the welfare implications of trade arising from oligopsony power.

One final good and the intermediate good employ primary factors, whereas the other final good uses labor and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>input.</b> All markets operate under perfect competition except for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>input,</b> which is oligopsonistic.

Using detailed plant-level data from the Indian manufacturing sector, I �irst show {{that the increase in}} imported <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> in response to input tariff liberalization has strong displacement effects on production workers employed by importing plants. Next, I decompose the impact of <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> on labour into “quality”, “variety”, and “scale ” effects, based on the availability and prices of domestically-produced inputs. I �ind that the displacement of production workers is driven by lower-priced imported <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs,</b> the “scale ” effect. Finally, I examine the differential effect of tariff liberalization based on whether plants experience import competition or not. This analysis reveals that domestic plants facing import competition experience a displacement of both skilled and unskilled workers in response to tariff liberalization. Plants that switch from in-house production to importing some <b>intermediate</b> <b>inputs</b> however only displace production workers while retaining skilled workers. This suggests that skilled workers are indispensable to plants switching to importing as a productivity enhancing strategy. I am indebted to Jennifer Poole for her constant guidance and support.
