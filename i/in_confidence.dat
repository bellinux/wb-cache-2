After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop <b>in</b> <b>confidence</b> due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory comments about her sexuality made by fellow national team players.

5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting <b>in</b> <b>confidence</b> {{but then in}} public sessions. It {{prepared}} a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|At age 18, {{playing in}} a limited role for HV71 during the 2010–11 season, Fast scored 16 points (seven goals, nine assists) in 36 games, with a +6 plus-minus, six penalty minutes and two power play goals, {{exceeded}} most observers' expectations. Fast credited playing alongside Johan Davidsson {{as part of the}} reason for his success and growth <b>in</b> <b>confidence.</b> He was held scoreless with a -3 plus-minute in three postseason games as the first-place HV71 was swept from the first round of the playoffs by Allmänna Idrottsklubben (AIK) in an upset. In the 2011–12 season, Fast had three multi-point games, including a career-high four assists and five points against AIK on October 4. That game started a streak of 10 points (one goal, nine assists) over six games, which continued to an October 20 match against Frölunda HC. However, Fast's season was cut short after he suffered a fractured ankle during a November 29 game against Brynäs IF. He missed three months as a result, but nevertheless recorded 16 points (five goals, 11 assists) in 21 games for the season, matching his Swedish Hockey League career high in points and establishing new career highs in assists and plus-minus (+9). He also scored two goals and one assist in five postseason games.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow <b>in</b> <b>confidence.</b> They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Later, Danny {{begins to}} date Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), the fun-loving niece of Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira). Gabrielle and Carlos overhear Angie and Nick {{fighting}} about their secret, which prompts {{them to send}} Ana to a modeling academy in New York for her safety. Danny follows Ana without his parents' knowledge. Angie and Gabrielle travel to New York to bring Danny home and Angie confesses her past to Gabrielle <b>in</b> <b>confidence.</b> Patrick tracks Angie back to Fairview, where he hits Nick with his car. While Nick is in the hospital, Patrick moves into the Bolen home and takes Angie and Danny hostage and forces Angie to build him a second bomb. He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a detonator from down the street. However, the bomb {{in the house was}} a decoy; Angie had planted the actual bomb in the detonator. Patrick dies in the explosion and Angie and Nick, still on the run from the FBI, relocate to Atlanta, Georgia while Danny moves to New York to be closer to his grandmother and Ana.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking <b>in</b> <b>confidence</b> due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
