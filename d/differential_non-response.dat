40|$|The US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Eurosystem 2 ̆ 019 s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provide {{evidence}} that wealth is heavily concentrated at the upper tail of the wealth distribution. A commonly cited number for the US is that 1 percent of the households hold 30 percent of total household wealth. I investigate the reliability of upper tail wealth estimates from household wealth surveys {{in the presence of}} survey <b>differential</b> <b>non-response,</b> i. e. the fact that richer households have lower response rates than poorer households. <b>Differential</b> <b>non-response</b> can often not be remedied by adjustment of survey weights, as wealth of the non-responding households remains unobserved. <b>Differential</b> <b>non-response</b> biases tail wealth estimates downwards. Monte Carlo evidence shows that such a bias can be quite substantial. I provide a method that greatly reduces the bias. The method combines survey data with data from rich lists and uses them jointly to estimate a Pareto (power-law) distribution for tail wealth. Using this method, the paper combines the SCF and HFCS data with Forbes World 2 ̆ 019 s billionaires data to provide new estimates of tail wealth. For surveys with low or no oversampling of the wealthy, these estimates tend to indicate a higher concentration of wealth at the top than those calculated from the wealth surveys alone...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} bias and {{efficiencies}} of different estimation techniques aimed at creating a {{unique set of}} case weights, which can be used to estimate characteristics for both person and household variables in a household sampling survey. The resulting estimates are compatible with external population information and thus attempt to correct for <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> (i. e. under-representation of certain parts of the population). The existing techniques of calibration and integrated weighting and cosmetic estimators are combined and modified to give improved weighted estimators. The theoretical properties of these estimators are outlined, and the performance of the estimators is investigated via simulation studies and by application to a data set. The effect of using auxiliary information on persons only, or on both persons and households, is evaluated. The performance of the estimators under condition of <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> has been simulated by using unequal probability sampling to mimic such conditions. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} a practical evaluation of some leading density forecast scoring {{rules in the}} context of forecast surveys. We analyse the density forecasts of UK inflation obtained from the Bank of England’s Survey of External Forecasters, considering both the survey average forecasts published in the Bank’s quarterly Inflation Report, and the individual survey responses recently made available to researchers by the Bank. The density forecasts are collected in histogram format, and the ranked probability score (RPS) is shown to have clear advantages over other scoring rules. Missing observations are a feature of forecast surveys, and we introduce an adjustment to the RPS, based on the Yates decomposition, to improve its comparative measurement of forecaster performance in the face of <b>differential</b> <b>non-response.</b> The new measure, denoted RPS*, is recommended to analysts of forecast surveys...|$|E
40|$|Missing {{data are}} almost always a problem in {{longitudinal}} research. Item <b>non-response,</b> <b>differential</b> attrition, failure to obtain measurements at equal time intervals, and unbalanced panel designs used {{to be difficult to}} analyze at best and remain a threat to the validity of a study. A related technical problem, customarily given little importance but nevertheless strongly related to validity threats, is that most multivariate methods require complete data. Incomplete data are often dealt with by listwise or pairwise deletion methods, which omit entire records, or pairs of variables, with missing values. Sometimes a researcher will substitute sample means for the missing values. All three approaches aim to fix up the data {{so that they can be}} analyzed by methods designed for complete data but are ad hoc and have little theoretical justification. The method of full-information maximum likelihood (FIML), in contrast, has long been known as a theory-based approach to the treatment of missing data. FIML assumes multivariate normality, and maximizes the likelihood of the model given the observed data. The theoretical advantages of this fullinformation method are widely recognized, and it is now implemented in the Amos and Mx structural equation modeling programs. Unfortunately, theory has not had much influence on practice in the treatment of missing data. In part, th...|$|R
40|$|Levels of childlessness {{reported}} by the same cohorts of women and surveyed by the British General Household Survey increase with age by over 50 per cent between their early 40 s and their late 50 s for women born in the early 1940 s. Yet the reported mean fertility of parous women remains constant with increasing age. Similar results hold within sub-groups such as different educational and marital status groups. Possible reasons for these findings include declining comparability of the base population over time due to differential migration, mortality, or institutionalization, changes in survey design and content, and <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> by childless and parous women. The evidence shows {{that these are not}} adequate explanations. The most likely reason is deliberate under-reporting of childbearing among older cohorts of women. The findings have implications for the interpretation of retrospective data in surveys and for the availability of informal care for older people...|$|E

40|$|Background: The Australian {{population}} {{that relies on}} mobile phones exclusively has increased from 5 % in 2005 to 29 % in 2014. Failing to include this mobile-only population leads to a potential bias in estimates from landline-based telephone surveys. This paper considers the impacts on selected health prevalence estimates with and without the mobile-only population. Methods: Using data from the Australian Health Survey - which, for the first time, included a question on telephone status - we examined demographic, geographic and health differences between the landline-accessible and mobile-only population. These groups were also compared to the full population, controlling for the sampling design and <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> patterns in the observed sample through weighting and benchmarking. Results: The landline-accessible population differs from the mobile-only population for selected health measures resulting in biased prevalence estimates for smoking, alcohol risk and private health insurance coverage in the full population. The differences remain even after adjusting for age and gender. Conclusions: Using landline telephones only for conducting population health surveys {{will have an impact}} on prevalence rate estimates of health risk factors due to the differing profiles of the mobile-only population from the landline-accessible population...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} in surveys is generally facing missing data. In longitudinal studies for some missing values {{there might be}} past or future data points available. The question arises how to successfully transform this advantage into improved imputation strategies. In a simulation study the authors compare six combinations of cross-sectional and longitudinal imputation strategies for German wealth panel data. The authors create simulation data sets by blanking out observed data points: they induce item non response by a missing at random (MAR) and two <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> (DNR) mechanisms. We test the performance of multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE), an imputation procedure for panel data known as the row-and-column method and a regression prediction with correction for sample selection. The regression and MICE approaches serve as fallback methods, when only cross-sectional data is available. The row-and-column method performs surprisingly well considering the cross-sectional evaluation criteria. For trend estimates and the measurement of inequality, combining MICE with the row-and-column technique regularly improves the results based on a catalogue of six evaluation criteria including three separate inequality indices. As for wealth mobility, two additional criteria show that a model based approach such as MICE might be the preferable choice. Overall {{the results show that}} if the variables, which ought to be imputed, are highly skewed, the row-and-column technique should not be dismissed beforehand. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to use different methods to weight National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Typically when weighting NHANES data we use a weighting class approach of predefined cells based on {{a limited number of}} variables. However, there are model based alternatives that allow for more flexibility in calculating the statistical weights. This flexibility is important because additional variables in non-response adjustments may be needed to better reduce the bias arising from the fact that non-respondents may be different from those who responded to the survey. In this paper, using NHANES data from 2003 - 04, we illustrate alternative methods to calculate statistical weights using both a weighting class approach and a model based approach to account for unit non-response. The WTADJUST procedure in SUDAAN version 10. 0 was used to calculate weights using different approaches. Different weighting approaches were assessed using examples with the environmental subsample data and the dietary recall data from NHANES. Summary statistics derived from the different methods were compared. In addition, the distributions of the weights were compared and the influence on variance inflation was assessed by comparing the estimated design effects due to the differential weighting. We found that the comparison of the different weighting approaches varied by analysis variables with subsamples. Therefore, it is important to assess different weighting approaches for specific subsamples and specific variables when analyzing data subject to <b>differential</b> <b>non-response...</b>|$|E
40|$|Māori, the {{indigenous}} people of New Zealand, experience disproportionate rates of stomach cancer, compared to non-Māori. The overall aim {{of the study was}} to better understand the reasons for the considerable excess of stomach cancer in Māori and to identify priorities for prevention. Māori stomach cancer cases from the New Zealand Cancer Registry between 1 February 2009 and 31 October 2013 and Māori controls, randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll were matched by 5 -year age bands to cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) between exposures and stomach cancer risk. Post-stratification weighting of controls was used to account for <b>differential</b> <b>non-response</b> by deprivation category. The study comprised 165 cases and 480 controls. Nearly half (47. 9 %) of cases were of the diffuse subtype. There were differences in the distribution of risk factors between cases and controls. Of interest were the strong relationships seen with increased stomach risk and having > 2 people sharing a bedroom in childhood (OR 3. 30, 95 %CI 1. 95 - 5. 59), testing for H pylori (OR 12. 17, 95 %CI 6. 15 - 24. 08), being an ex-smoker (OR 2. 26, 95 %CI 1. 44 - 3. 54) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in adulthood (OR 3. 29, 95 %CI 1. 94 - 5. 59). Some results were attenuated following post-stratification weighting. This is the first national study of stomach cancer in any indigenous population and the first Māori-only population-based study of stomach cancer undertaken in New Zealand. We emphasize caution in interpreting the findings given the possibility of selection bias. Population-level strategies to reduce the incidence of stomach cancer in Māori include expanding measures to screen and treat those infected with H pylori and a continued policy focus on reducing tobacco consumption and uptake...|$|E

Children and their families were initially interviewed in 2004 / 2005 when the children were aged 8 &# 8211; 12 years (SPARCLE 1); they were approached again in 2009 / 2010 at age 13 &# 8211; 17 years (SPARCLE 2). The objective of this report is to assess potential for bias due to family non-response in SPARCLE 2.

Results 					Of the 818 families who participated in SPARCLE 1, 224 / 818 (27 %) did not participate in SPARCLE 2. 51 / 818 (6 %) were not traced.

Of the remaining 714 families, 120 / 714 (17 %) declined to participate.
