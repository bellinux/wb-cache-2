25|$|The lantern {{at the top}} of the Medici Chapel is {{made out}} of marble and has an “….unusual {{polyhedron}} mounted on the peak of the conical roof,”. The orb that <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the lantern has seventy-two facets and is about two feet in diameter. The orb and cross, that <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the orb, are traditional symbols of the Roman and Christian power, and recalls the similar orbs on central dome plan churches like St. Maria del Fiore and St. Peter’s. But because it is on a private mausoleum, the Medici family is promoting their own personal power with the orb and cross, laurel wreath and lion heads, which are all symbols of status and power.|$|E

Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the camshaft <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E

25|$|One {{thing that}} is {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It was {{at the back of}} the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley.

The pectoral fins are large; the pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The anal fin is placed well in front of the caudal fin, which is broad with a short lower lobe and a long upper lobe bearing a strong ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are large and rough, particularly {{on the sides of the}} body.

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was delivered}} to Cooper in January 1932. Schoedsack contributed to the film, focusing on shooting scenes for the boat sequences and in native villages, leaving Cooper to shoot the jungle scenes. In February 1933, the title for the film was registered for copyright. Throughout filming there were creative battles. Critics at RKO argued that the film should begin with Kong. Cooper believed that a film should begin with a [...] "slow dramatic buildup that would establish everything from characters to mood..." [...] so that {{the action of the}} film could [...] "naturally, relentlessly, roll on out of its own creative movement," [...] and thus chose to not begin the film with a shot of Kong. The iconic scene in which Kong <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Empire State Building was almost called off by Cooper for legal reasons, but was kept in the film because RKO bought the rights to The Lost World.|$|E
