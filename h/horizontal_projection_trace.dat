40|$|The {{forest biomass}} {{has had a}} growing {{importance}} in the global economy, by applications in bioenergy, development of bioproducts and issues related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Forest biomass is a global strategic reserve that must be inventoried and monitored.

Considering these facts, it is urgent to develop reliable techniques, low costs, to obtain this kind of information.

40|$|India is a {{multilingual}} multi-script country. In {{every state}} of India {{there are two}} languages one is state local language {{and the other is}} English. For example in Andhra Pradesh, a state in India, the document may contain text words in English and Telugu script. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of such a bilingual document, it is necessary to identify the script before feeding the text words to the OCRs of individual scripts. In this paper, we are introducing a simple and efficient technique of script identification for Kannada, English and Hindi text words of a printed document. The proposed approach is based on the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>projection</b> profile for the discrimination of the three scripts. The feature extraction is done based on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>projection</b> profile of each text words. We analysed 700 different words of Kannada, English and Hindi in order to extract the discrimination features and for the development of knowledge base. We use the <b>horizontal</b> <b>projection</b> profile of each text word and based on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>projection</b> profile we extract the appropriate features. The proposed system is tested on 100 different document images containing more than 1000 text words of each script and a classification rate of 98. 25 %, 99. 25 % and 98. 87 % is achieved for Kannada, English and Hindi respectively.

We motivated {{by the fact that the}} majority of the Latin characters have vertical strokes. We claim that the proposed approach is more efficient and gives more accurate results compared with the state-of-the-art skew detection algorithm based on <b>horizontal</b> <b>projections</b> since it is noise and warp resistant. For these reasons, it can be efficiently applied to historical machine printed documents. Experimental results on a database with representative historical printed documents prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Multi-resolution segmentation method and object-oriented classification, based on very high spatial resolution satellite images, were used to obtain the area of tree crown <b>horizontal</b> <b>projection</b> for umbrella pine (Pinus pinea L.).

Errors smaller than 10 % are obtained for stand areas greater than 1. 4 ha.
