5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E

25|$|Staging and {{treatment}} are generally handled by an oncologist familiar with <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancer.</b> Surgery is {{a mainstay of}} therapy depending on anatomical staging and is usually reserved for cancers that have not spread beyond the vulva. Surgery may involve a wide local excision, radical partial vulvectomy, or radical complete vulvectomy with removal of vulvar tissue, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. In cases of early vulvar cancer, the surgery may be less extensive and consist of wide excision or a simple vulvectomy. Surgery is significantly more extensive when the cancer has spread to nearby organs such as the urethra, vagina, or rectum. Complications of surgery include wound infection, sexual dysfunction, edema and thrombosis, as well as lymphedema secondary to dissected lymph nodes.|$|E

25|$|Vulvar {{cancer causes}} less than 1% of all cancer cases and deaths but around 6% of all <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> {{diagnosed}} in the UK. Around 1,200 women {{were diagnosed with}} the disease in 2011, and 400 women died in 2012.

500|$|In the United States, {{endometrial cancer}} is the most {{frequently}} diagnosed <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancer</b> and, in women, the fourth most common cancer overall, representing 6% of all cancer cases in women. In that country, [...] {{it was estimated that}} 52,630women were diagnosed yearly and 8,590 would die from the disease. Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America have the highest rates of endometrial cancer, whereas Africa and West Asia have the lowest rates. Asia saw 41% of the world's endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012, whereas Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America together comprised 48% of diagnoses. Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013. Some of this rise {{may be due to the}} increase in obesity rates in developed countries, increasing life expectancies, and lower birth rates. The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2–3% in people with uteruses. In the UK, approximately 7,400cases are diagnosed annually, and in the EU, approximately 88,000.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{lymphedema}} affects {{both men}} and women. In women, it is most prevalent in the upper limbs after breast cancer surgery, in particular after axillary lymph node dissection, occurring in the arm {{on the side of}} the body in which the surgery is performed. Breast and trunk lymphedema can also occur but, go unrecognised as there is swelling in the area after surgery and its symptoms ( [...] peau d' orange and/or an inverted nipple [...] ) can be confused with post surgery fat necrosis. In Western countries, secondary lymphedema is most commonly due to cancer treatment. Between 38 and 89% of breast cancer patients suffer from lymphedema due to axillary lymph node dissection and/or radiation. Unilateral lymphedema occurs in up to 41% of patients after <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancer.</b> For men, a 5-66% incidence of lymphedema has been reported in patients treated with incidence depending on whether staging or radical removal of lymph glands was done in addition to radiotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Few {{scholars}} within occupational science, {{therapy and}} oncology recognize {{the impact of}} sexual activity {{on the quality of}} life and wellbeing of individuals (Sakellariou 2 ̆ 6 Algado, 2006). This is especially true for women with <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> who undergo surgical treatments that alter their body image, change their ability to participate in meaningful occupations, and decrease their quality of life (Reis, Beji, 2 ̆ 6 Coskun, 2010). In particular, there is a gap in the literature exploring how {{the quality of life of}} women with <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> relates to their perception of social pressures for activity participation and their confidence to participate in sexual, homecare, and work occupations. This paper will present an interdisciplinary and collaborative study of the relationship between quality of life and the perceived occupational possibilities of women with newly diagnosed <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Approximately 100 women with newly diagnosed <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> requiring surgery will complete quality of life assessments and the Possibilities for Activity Scale- Gynecologic Oncology (PAcTS-GO) at one month after their primary surgical treatment (Pergolotti 2 ̆ 6 Reeve, 2014). The PAcTS-GO assesses individuals’ perception of social pressures and their confidence in doing occupations. A regression approach will assess correlates with quality of life. We hypothesize that higher quality of life scores will be associated with higher scores on the PAcTS-GO. In other words, women with better overall quality of life, following surgery, will have more confidence in activity participation and a stronger perception that sexual, work and home care occupations are socially ideal. These findings will enhance understandings of quality of life and survivorship for women with <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> and will elucidate the relationship between perceived social norms and quality life. Finally, this study will further understandings of occupational possibilities as related to the lived experience, and perceived possibilities of participation in occupations for women with cancer...|$|R

50|$|<b>Gynecologic</b> <b>cancer</b> {{disparities in}} the United States refer to {{differences}} in incidence, prevalence, and mortality from gynecologic cancers between population groups. The five main types of <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancer</b> include cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, and vulvar cancer. For patients with these and other gynecologic malignancies within the United States, disparities across the care continuum by socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic background have been previously identified and studied.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. The human microbiome is the collection of microorganisms in the body that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Recent studies indicate that perturbations in the microbiome may be implicated {{in a number of}} diseases, including cancer. More specifically, changes in the gut and vaginal microbiomes may be associated with a variety of <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers,</b> including cervical cancer, uterine cancer, and ovarian cancer. Current research and gaps in knowledge regarding the association between the gut and vaginal microbiomes and the development, progression, and treatment of <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> are reviewed here. In addition, the potential use of probiotics to manage symptoms of these <b>gynecologic</b> <b>cancers</b> is discussed. A better understanding of how the microbiome composition is altered at these sites and its interaction with the host may aid in prevention, optimization of current therapies, development of new therapeutic agents and/or dosing regimens, and possibly limit the side effects associated with cancer treatment...|$|R
