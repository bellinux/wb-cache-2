5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes. He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state. Tanaka breaks into convulsions and displays a high fever, but refuses any help from Mulder or Scully. When he is put on a stretcher for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a throbbing bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds sand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs,</b> indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} case {{of possible}} BHD {{in the medical}} literature was published by Burnier and Rejsek in 1927, who described a case of perifollicular fibromas on a 56-year-old woman's face. Trichodiscomas were first described in 1974 by H.S. Zackheim and H. Pinkus, but were not associated with BHD until Birt, Hogg, and Dubé. The first case of BHD with the systemic symptoms was described by Hornstein and Knickenberg and found in two siblings and their father, all of whom exhibited colon polyps and the characteristic fibrofolliculomas. Though the siblings did not have renal or pulmonary symptoms, their father had cysts <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> and kidneys. Hornstein-Knickenberg syndrome is a now-deprecated name for the inherited fibrofolliculomas inherent to Birt–Hogg–Dubé.|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he forced himself to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs,</b> and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E

25|$|Ventura {{continued}} to wrestle until September 1984 when blood clots <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> ended his in-ring career. He {{claimed that the}} blood clots were {{a result of his}} exposure to Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. Ventura returned to the ring in 1985, forming a tag-team with Randy Savage and Savage's manager (and real-life wife) Miss Elizabeth. Often after their televised matches Ventura would taunt and challenge fellow commentator Bruno Sammartino, but nothing ever came of this.|$|E

25|$|Ludwig's {{death was}} {{official}}ly ruled a suicide by drowning, but the official autopsy report indicated that no water was found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> Ludwig {{was a very}} strong swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist-deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to the head and neck and signs of strangulation, leading to the suspicion that he was strangled, although there is no more evidence to prove this.|$|E
25|$|In February 1991, {{the band}} decided {{to once again}} enlist Ezrin to produce their next album. Before {{recording}} could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck.

It was successfully removed the following month, but more tumors were soon discovered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> Carr received chemotherapy and was pronounced cancer-free in July. However, in September he suffered the first of two cerebral hemorrhages. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41. Coincidentally, Queen frontman Freddie Mercury died the same day.|$|E

500|$|On September 19, Hershiser's four-day-old son Jordan was {{suffering}} from fluid buildup <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> in a Pasadena hospital. Hershiser, by winning that day reduced the Dodgers' magic number to five over the Reds. Publications such as The New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times began {{to take note of}} the streak length and the nearer horizon of the record as Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings with this win. Several Canadian newspapers even used the word chasing to note Hershiser's progresse.g., The Ottawa Citizen ran a story titled [...] "Hershiser chasing record".|$|E
500|$|Voss, who had {{until now}} been hiding behind his legal advisor, has {{a change of}} heart upon hearing of Mulder’s {{condition}} and tells Skinner of the aforementioned testing. Skinner goes to Weaver’s apartment after getting his name from Dr. Voss and finds a man tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth. When Skinner removes the gauze wrapper around the man’s mouth, the man chokes and beetles begin crawling from his mouth. At the hospital, Mulder is in grave danger due to the beetle eggs now hatching <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs,</b> and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) attempts {{to find a way to}} save him, because he is now [...] "too weak for thoracic surgery." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver {{attempts}} to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light {{one of the}} toxic cigarettes. As Weaver {{attempts to}} leave the building, Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette {{to the floor and}} Skinner dramatically snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder’s life. She is correct in her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. [...] Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a case {{history of a}} former insulator who developed concomitant retroperitoneal and pleural fibrosis. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> work, the patient had been exposed {{on a daily basis}} to asbestos dust while demolishing and installing pipeline insulations. The heavy asbestos exposure was confirmed by a high level of asbestos content <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autopsy <b>lung</b> sample. We propose that both retroperitoneal fibrosis and diffuse pleural thickening were induced in our patient by an abundant amount of amphibole asbestos fibres found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lung</b> and retroperitoneal tissues...|$|R

500|$|On May 2, 2008, a {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) scan showed that he had very tiny ( [...] or less) metastases <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> and {{in some of the}} lymph nodes in his chest. He also had metastases in his peritoneal and retroperitoneal cavities. On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based approaches. On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and that Pausch had [...] "taken a step down" [...] and was [...] "much sicker than he had been". The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a hospice program designed to provide palliative care to those at the end of life.|$|E
500|$|On May 12, 1990, Henson {{traveled}} to Ahoskie, North Carolina, {{with his daughter}} Cheryl, to visit his father and stepmother. They both returned to New York on May 13, and Henson canceled a Muppet recording session scheduled for May 14. That night, Henson's wife Jane, from whom he was separated, came to visit for the last time. Hours later, on May 15, Henson suffered a medical emergency; {{he was having trouble}} breathing and began coughing up blood. He suggested to his wife that he might be dying, but did not want to take time from his schedule to visit a hospital. Jane later stated that while Henson's Christian Science upbringing [...] "affect his general thinking", it did not have any influence on his postponement of medical treatment, and still later told People magazine that his avoidance was likely due to his desire not to be a bother to anyone. His stepmother and others also denied rumors that Henson's Christian Science beliefs might have contributed to his death, as Henson had ceased practicing in his early 20s. Two hours later, Henson finally agreed to be taken by taxi to New York Hospital in New York City. After arriving there at 4:58a.m. (EST), Henson stopped breathing and an X-ray revealed he had abscesses <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> Henson was placed on a ventilator, but his condition deteriorated rapidly despite aggressive treatment with multiple antibiotics.|$|E

The Reds made their manager's illness public on January 3, 1964. After radiation treatment in early February, he still felt relatively well in March during spring training. As The Sporting News noted, the team played the 1964 season with the terrible knowledge that Hutchinson [...] "probably was at death's door." ...|$|E
