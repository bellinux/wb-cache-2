5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{seroprevalence}} of HHV-8 varies significantly geographically and <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> {{in northern}} European, southeast Asian, and Caribbean countries are between 2-4%, in Mediterranean countries at approximately 10%, and in sub-Saharan African countries at approximately 40%. In South America, <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> {{are low in}} general but are high among Amerindians. Even within individual countries, significant variation can be observed across different regions, with <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> of about 19.2% in Xinjiang compared to about 9.5% in Hubei, China. Although seroprevalence has been consistently shown to increase with age in a linear manner, countries with high <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> may see higher seroprevalence in younger age groups.

40|$|In this work, {{we aim to}} {{understand}} {{the influence of the}} heterogeneity of <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> on the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading. Employing the classic SIS model as the benchmark, we study the influence of the independently identically distributed <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> on the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state. The log-normal, gamma and a newly designed distributions are considered for <b>infection</b> <b>rates.</b> We find that, when the recovery rate is small, i. e. the epidemic spreads out in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases: 1) the heterogeneity of <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> on average retards the virus spreading, and 2) a larger even-order moment of the <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> leads to a smaller average fraction of infected nodes, but the odd-order moments contribute in the opposite way; when the recovery rate is large, i. e. the epidemic may die out or infect {{a small fraction of the}} population, the heterogeneity of <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> may enhance the probability that the epidemic spreads out. Finally, we verify our conclusions via real-world networks with their heterogeneous <b>infection</b> <b>rates.</b> Our results suggest that, in reality the epidemic spread may not be so severe as the classic SIS model indicates, but to eliminate the epidemic is probably more difficult...|$|R
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% <b>infection</b> <b>rate.</b> A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Interventions {{that prevent}} healthcare-associated infections {{should lead to}} fewer deaths and shorter {{hospital}} stays.

The National Hand Hygiene Initiative in Australia aimed to improve hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers, with the goal of reducing <b>rates</b> of healthcare-associated <b>infections.</b> Methods: We examined if the introduction of the National Hand Hygiene Initiative was associated with a change in <b>infection</b> <b>rates.</b> Monthly <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> for six types of healthcare-associated infections were examined in 38 Australian hospitals across six states. Infection categories were: bloodstream infections, centralline associated bloodstream infections, methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and surgical site infections. Results: The National Hand Hygiene Initiative was associated with a statistically significant reduction in <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> in 11 out of 23 state and infection combinations studied.
