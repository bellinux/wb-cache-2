50|$|Duchossior's book, Gibson Electrics, The Classic Years, {{features}} {{a photo of}} a Gibson L5, serial number 88258 of 1929 (after Loar left Gibson), one of the original Loar-designed L5s, with fitted electrostatic pickup and factory-fitted <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> in the tailpiece.|$|R
5000|$|Electric guitars. Almost all {{electric}} guitars use a [...] in mono <b>jack</b> (<b>socket)</b> {{as their}} output connector. Some makes (such as Shergold) use a stereo jack instead for stereo output, or a second stereo jack, {{in addition to}} a mono jack (as with Rickenbacker).|$|R
50|$|Features {{included}} {{built in}} vibrato, spring reverb, Line Out <b>jack</b> <b>socket,</b> hum balance and overdrive boost pots (as of 1977). The vibrato was only accessible through a footswitch and the overdrive boost was {{made use of}} via a push pull function on the master volume knob.|$|R
50|$|This bass {{features}} the same specifications as the Precision Bass Plus, {{but has a}} downsized body shape, rear-routed controls, side-mounted <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> and a Kubicki-designed 2-band active EQ with separate stacked control pots for master volume, pickup pan, treble and bass. Introduced in 1992, it was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the American Deluxe Precision Bass in 1995.|$|R

Citygold cars have ergonomic, electronically adjustable seats, multi-channel ear phone <b>jack</b> <b>sockets</b> and individual overhead lighting.|$|R
50|$|Common mode {{filtering}} {{may also}} be used to prevent egress of noise for electromagnetic compatibility purposes. High frequency common mode signals, for example, RF noise from a computing circuit, may be blocked using a ferrite bead clamped to the outside of a cable. These are often observable on laptop computer power supplies near the <b>jack</b> <b>socket,</b> and good quality mouse or printer USB cables and HDMI cables.|$|R

Headsets for standard corded telephones are {{fitted with a}} standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm <b>jack</b> <b>sockets</b> for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Cornford Amplification {{issued a}} Richie Kotzen {{signature}} model - RK100, a single channel tube amp head developed and designed {{in collaboration with}} Kotzen to suit his expansive playing style. Cornford ceased production of all amplifiers, including the RK100, in 2013. [...] There were also matching signature model speaker cabinets, equipped with one or four Celestion Vintage 30 12" [...] speakers. Both the amplifier head and the speaker cabinets were the only Cornford models generally supplied with Kotzen-spec black tolex covering. The 4 x 12" [...] cabinet also includes a special locking <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> on the rear.|$|R

50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a locking nut clamps the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a locking nut. The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 4 GB MinoHD {{only has}} a 3.5mm <b>Jack</b> <b>socket</b> (4-way TRRS : Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve or A/V : audio-video) to composite (RCA) output for connecting to a television or input into other media viewing monitors. This was a major drawback to quick viewing of videos on a High Definition Television, considering that the produced video is captured in 720p high definition and composite cables are unable to transmit HD resolution to HD capable televisions. This flaw was corrected in the later released 8 GB version that now harnesses a mini HDMI output port, which now gives the option for Mini HDMI to composite (RCA) or component cables as well as Mini HDMI to HDMI allowing videos to be viewed in full HD on an HD capable television directly from the MinoHD camcorder.|$|R
5000|$|When a three-conductor {{version of}} the 6.35 mm ( [...] in) jack was {{introduced}} for use with stereo headphones, it was given a sharper tip profile {{in order to make}} it possible to manufacture <b>jacks</b> (<b>sockets)</b> that would accept only stereo plugs, to avoid short-circuiting the right channel of the amplifier. This attempt has long been abandoned, and now the normal convention is that all plugs fit all sockets of the same size, regardless of whether they are balanced or unbalanced, mono or stereo. Most 6.35 mm ( [...] in) plugs, mono or stereo, now have the profile of the original stereo plug, although a few rounded mono plugs are also still produced. The profiles of stereo miniature and subminiature plugs have always been identical to the mono plugs of the same size.|$|R
500|$|The 122 is {{the most}} popular Leslie. It was {{specifically}} designed for the Hammond organ and is the model most commonly identified with it. It is [...] high, contains separate motors for chorale and tremolo, and a 40 watt tube amplifier. The 122 {{is the most}} adaptable to being recorded, as it has a balanced signal which eliminates mains hum and other noise. The 122RV was the same model, but with an additional reverb amplifier, which fed through to a separate static speaker. A slightly smaller version, the [...] 142 was available. Hammond-Suzuki currently manufacture the 122A, a straight reissue of the 122, and the 122XB, which contains a modern 11-pin adapter, an IECC mains adaptor, line-in, and a <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> for a footswitch to control the speed. This eliminates the need for a combo preamp.|$|R
50|$|A plugboard, {{or control}} panel (the term used {{depended}} on the application area), is an array of <b>jacks,</b> or <b>sockets</b> (often called hubs), into which patch cords can be inserted to complete an electrical circuit. Control panels were used to direct the operation of some unit record equipment. Plugboards were used on some s, and some early computers.|$|R
5000|$|Silverface models: 45 watts (power {{increased}} to 70 watts in 1977 {{and a solid}} state rectifier added. There are known as the [...] "ultralinear" [...] models with different transformers. Master volume was added after 1972, and pull-out boost circuit added in 1975. Line Out <b>jack</b> <b>socket</b> and a 3-band equalization for the Normal Channel added in 1978.) Silverface amps made between '68 and '72 were emblazoned with [...] "Super Reverb-Amp" [...] with a tailed amp logo in the grille cloth. After 1972 this was changed to just [...] "Super Reverb" [...] and the tailed Fender logo from the mid 1960s was replaced with a modern [...] "unscripted" [...] tailless amp decal (changed to a [...] "scripted" [...] style in 1977). There were only minor adjustments made to the pre-1975 silverface Super Reverbs. Today after market kits are sold for non-master silverface amps allowing them to be taken back to the more desired blackface specs.|$|R
50|$|The {{intended}} {{use of these}} plugs is on the cable connected to a power supply. The matching <b>jack</b> or <b>socket</b> is then mounted in the equipment to be powered. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed contact, {{which can be used}} to disconnect internal batteries whenever the power supply is connected, avoiding the risk of battery leakage or explosion posed by incorrect recharging of the batteries.|$|R
5000|$|First Version - The {{first version}} {{appeared}} {{with a distinct}} Strat logo in the headstock, 24 medium jumbo frets (i.e. these are thicker and wider frets), a maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard and {{with one of the}} four neck [...] "bolts" [...] (screws) off-set {{at the bottom of the}} neck to allow a more comfortable [...] "heel" [...] area for playing in the upper registers, a lighter basswood body, or occasionally alder for US made guitars). The scale length is an even 25 in, rather than the normal 25.5 in commonly used on Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars. In addition, the Fender HM Strat had a Kahler licensed double-locking tremolo system, [...] "Spyder", and Gotoh tuners, one DiMarzio humbucking H* [...] "Super 3" [...] pickup ("H" [...] configuration), and sometimes two single coil pickups (S*, HSS configuration), two humbuckers, or sometimes a single additional Super Distortion, (HH configuration) and a side mounted <b>jack</b> <b>socket.</b> Kahler USA offers a detailed schematic diagram of the Kahler Spyder tremolo and several (but not all) replacement parts are available.|$|R
25|$|Electronic analog {{computers}} {{typically have}} front panels with numerous <b>jacks</b> (single-contact <b>sockets)</b> that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) {{to create the}} interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there {{is likely to be}} a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.|$|R
5000|$|The Fender Performer bass was {{a uniquely}} styled bass guitar, {{designed}} by John Page, {{renowned for its}} extremely slender neck (narrower than Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars). The Japanese Performer Standard has an alder body, with a bolt-on 34" [...] 24-fret micro-tilt adjustable maple neck and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard {{as opposed to the}} United States-made Performer Elite, which sports an ebony fretboard. Controls are: Tone, Volume, Pickup Selector Switch and TBX Circuit Control (Treble Bass eXpander). The latter provided the same tonal range as the Jazz Bass between 0 and 5, with the range 5-10 providing significantly brighter sound - oriented towards solo playing and particularly suiting the sharp attack needed for a slap bass playing style. Both basses were available in Burgundy Mist, Gun Metal Blue, Candy Green, White and Tobacco Sunburst. All finishes were metallic except for the sunburst. Both versions featured a number of minor features underlying the 'high end' design including rubber inserts around the volume and tone controls, a high-quality fully enclosed <b>jack</b> <b>socket,</b> a then new and contemporary Fender logo, sculpted pickups marked with an (original) Fender logo, felt washers to prevent the strap buttons marking the body and individual intonation adjustment for each string as standard (many P-Basses at this time had just two bridge pieces).|$|R
25|$|For mission safety, {{weeks before}} the manned mission on LK lander, an LK-R lander in {{unmanned}} L3 lunar expedition complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers {{would be sent to}} the Moon for preliminary study of surface around LK-R and LK sites, for work as radio beacons for precision landings of LK-R and LK, and for visual estimate of status of them. LK-R used as a reserve escape craft in case of disability to start from Moon of LK and Lunokhods used by cosmonaut for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research. This manned version of Lunokhod were additionally equipped with oxygen stock with hose <b>socket,</b> standing <b>pads</b> and manual control for the cosmonaut in front part.|$|R

50|$|The {{support arm}} {{was a heavy}} steel forging {{reaching}} a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to {{as close to the}} centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral <b>pad</b> <b>socketed</b> the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high frame cross-beam. A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old-fashioned horizontal shock absorber whose two cylinders were side by side.|$|R
50|$|The {{stage box}} {{typically}} houses between 16 and 32 female XLR connectors; the actual input configuration {{depends on the}} number of channels contained in the multicore cable. All of the microphones and musical instruments connect to the stage box and then the multicore cable runs to the sound desk or audio mixer. There are often 4-8 Male XLR Connectors on the stage box which are called returns. Occasionally these are 6.3 mm phone connectors, but the use of <b>Jack</b> plugs or <b>sockets</b> on a multicore is strongly discouraged. The returns allow for the sending of line level audio from the sound desk to the stage for foldback and FOH.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and <b>sockets</b> (<b>jacks)</b> to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R
50|$|Mini-TOSLINK is a {{standardized}} {{optical fiber connector}} smaller than the standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer audio equipment. The plug is almost {{the same size and}} shape as the ubiquitous 3.5 mm stereo minijack. Adapters are available to connect a full-size TOSLINK plug to a mini-TOSLINK socket. Combined 3.5 mm <b>jack</b> and mini-TOSLINK <b>sockets</b> exist which can accept a 3.5 mm jack or a mini-TOSLINK plug; mini-TOSLINK plugs are made 0.5 mm longer than electrical jack plugs so that the latter are too short to touch and damage the LED of combined connectors. Many laptop computer and portable digital audio equipment models, such as the Google Chromecast Audio device and Apple AirPort Express and iPod Hi-Fi, use these connectors that allow for the insertion of 3.5 mm analog (electrical) headphone output or microphone input or mini-TOSLINK digital (optical) output.|$|R
