THE PRINCIPLE OF DIFFERENTIAL MAPPING The idea of differential mapping is not new.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Informal {{employment}} (IE) {{is one of}} {{the least}} studied employment conditions in public health research, mainly due to the difficulty of its conceptualization and its measurement, producing a lack of a unique concept and a common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to identify literature on IE in order to improve its definition and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> with special attention given to high-income countries, to be able to study the possible impact on health inequalities within and between countries. METHODS: A scoping review <b>of</b> definitions and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> IE was conducted reviewing relevant databases and grey literature and analyzing selected articles. RESULTS: We found a wide spectrum of terms for describing IE as well as definitions and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> We provide a definition of IE to be used in health inequalities research in high-income countries. Direct methods such as surveys can capture more information about workers and firms in order to estimate IE. CONCLUSIONS: These results can be used in further investigations about the impacts of this IE on health inequalities. Public health research must improve monitoring and analysis of IE in order to know the impacts of this employment condition on health inequalities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> idiographic <b>measurement</b> for dynamic {{assessment}} (DA) intervention. There {{are two main}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> for DA intervention; split -half tests and integrated scoring systems. Split-half tests of ability have proved useful from a research perspective. Integrated scoring systems coupled with case studies are useful from a practitioner perspective. The purpose {{of this research is}} {{to bridge the gap between}} research and practice by developing a methodology that is compatible with both. To this end the paper proposes a measureable idiographic <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> which utilises multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and general procrustean analysis (GPA) to analyse the result of card-sort data gathered from a learner across the entire intervention. This approach provides a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> assessment, which is both compatible with individual intervention and suited to building a body of evidence-based research for DA. An example <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> in practice is given for illustrative purposes. The initial results suggest that this approach provides a methodology that satisfies the requirements of both practitioners when formulating targeted intervention and researchers who require <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> change in ability of the individual over time...|$|R
