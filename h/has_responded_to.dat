5|$|Boycott <b>has</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> these accusations by {{pointing}} out that Lillee had been out of cricket for 21 months suffering from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut Test against Pakistan (Thomson's match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President's XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Nowitzki's career, he <b>has</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the {{increased}} {{pressure of the}} playoffs by increasing his productivity. As {{of the end of}} the 2013–14 season, he had averaged 22.5 points and 8.1 rebounds in the regular season. In the playoffs, he has averaged 25.6 points and 10.1 rebounds, which only Hakeem Olajuwon, Bob Pettit, and Elgin Baylor have managed to do. In the most pressure packed games, such as playoff elimination games he averages 28.8 points, 11.8 rebounds. He has had 14 elimination games where he scored 30 or more points, which ties him with Jerry West for most all time. Of the top 100 elimination game performances in the last 20 years, Nowitzki has had the best performances in 8 of them, more than any other player in the NBA in that same time frame.|$|E

5|$|With his students, Voight has {{analyzed}} pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and {{volcanic eruption}} prediction. Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and <b>has</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, Alice {{travels to}} Alaska in an airplane, {{tracking}} broadcasts {{from a safe}} haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of Los Angeles, where they find survivors living in a prison which is surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, (Boris Kodjoe) who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Clarke), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice finally lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it <b>has</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to peep. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked {{by a group of}} infected that dug into the prison. They take Wendell, but she manages to kill them.|$|E
