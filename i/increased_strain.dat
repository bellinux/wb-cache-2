Second, the demands to balance work and family result in more overall stressors for women that leads to <b>increased</b> <b>strain.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh-speed {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} characterize the deformation and failure of Styrene Butadiene Rubber at impact rates. Dynamic tensile stress–strain curves of uniaxial strip specimens and force–extension curves of thin sheets were obtained from a Charpy tensile impact apparatus. Results from the uniaxial tension tests indicated that although the rubber became stiffer with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain</b> rates, the stress–strain curves remained virtually the same above 280 s− 1. Above this critical strain rate, strength, fracture strain and toughness decreased with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain</b> rates. When strain rates were below 180 s− 1, the initial modulus, tensile strength and breaking extension <b>increased</b> as the <b>strain</b> rate <b>increased.</b> Between <b>strain</b> rates of 180 and 280 s− 1, the initial modulus and tensile strength <b>increased</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain</b> rates but the extension at break decreased with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain</b> rates. A hyper-viscoelastic constitutive relation of integral form was {{used to describe the}} rate-dependent material behavior of the rubber. Two characteristic relaxation times, 5 ms and 0. 25 ms, were needed to fit the proposed constitutive equation to the data. The proposed constitutive equation was implemented in ABAQUS Explicit via a user-defined subroutine and used to predict the dynamic response of the rubber sheets in the experiments. Numerical predictions for the transient deformation and failure of the rubber sheet were within 10 % of experimental results...|$|R
60|$|It is at {{this point}} that we are enabled to invoke the aid of the {{principles}} which have been laid down in this Third Part. The cost of production of food and agricultural produce has been analyzed in a preceding chapter. It depends on the productiveness of the least fertile land, or of the least productively employed portion of capital, which the necessities of society have as yet put in requisition for agricultural purposes. The cost of production of the food grown in these least advantageous circumstances determines, as we have seen, the exchange value and money price of the whole. In any given state, therefore, of the laborers’ habits, their money wages depend on the productiveness of the least fertile land, or least productive agricultural capital: on the point which cultivation has reached in its downward progress—in its encroachments on the barren lands, and its gradually <b>increased</b> <b>strain</b> upon the powers of the more fertile. Now, the force which urges cultivation in this downward course is the increase of people; while the counter-force, which checks the descent, is the improvement of agricultural science and practice, enabling the same soil to yield to the same labor more ample returns. The costliness of the most costly part of the produce of cultivation is an exact expression of the state, at any given moment, of the race which population and agricultural skill are always running against each other.|$|E

A simple model is suggested that correlates the increase in the motion of proximal waters of hydration to the increase in frequency of libration of the protein backbone that develops with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain.</b> Together, the reduction in the protein entropy accompanied with the increase in entropy of the proximal waters of hydration with <b>increasing</b> <b>strain,</b> support the notion that the source of elasticity is driven by an entropic mechanism arising from the change in entropy of the protein backbone...|$|R
