The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the implementation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems from the perspective of stakeholders and the performance of the technology. Therefore, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the management and care professionals of six {{care facilities}}. Moreover, light measurements were conducted in order to describe the exposure of residents to lighting. The results showed that the main reason for purchasing <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems lied in the assumption that the well-being and day/night rhythmicity of residents could be improved. The majority of care professionals were not aware of the reasons why <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems were installed. Despite positive subjective ratings of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems, no data were collected by the organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of the lighting. Although the care professionals stated that they did not see any large positive effects of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems on the residents and their own work situation, the majority appreciated the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems more than the old situation. The light values measured in the care facilities did not exceed the minimum threshold values reported in the literature. Therefore, it seems illogical that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> systems installed in the researched care facilities will have any positive health effects...|$|R

25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E
2500|$|Commonly, FCS is {{employed}} {{in the context of}} optical microscopy, in particular Confocal microscopy or two-photon excitation microscopy. In these techniques light is focused on a sample and the measured [...] fluorescence intensity fluctuations (due to diffusion, physical or chemical reactions, aggregation, etc.) are analyzed using the temporal autocorrelation. Because the measured property is essentially related to the magnitude and/or the amount of fluctuations, there is an optimum measurement regime at the level when individual species enter or exit the observation volume (or turn on and off in the volume). When too many entities are measured {{at the same time the}} overall fluctuations are small in comparison to the total signal and may not be resolvable – in the other direction, if the individual fluctuation-events are too sparse in time, one measurement may take prohibitively too long. FCS is in a way the fluorescent counterpart to <b>dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering, which uses coherent light scattering, instead of (incoherent) fluorescence.|$|E

40|$|Lighting {{design is}} an {{important}} element of game design, due to its role in directing attention, providing visibility, establishing important information concerning period and time of day, influencing emotions, and affecting presence. The current lighting technique used within the game industry relies on static cinematic lighting design methods, which are inappropriate for gaming environments. Game environments are dynamic; therefore, a lighting design that accommodates to such changes is required. While <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> is feasible, the current state of lighting design theory and techniques do not incorporate <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting,</b> and thus the aesthetic utility of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> remains uncharted territory. This paper addresses this issue to provide a first step towards developing a lighting design theory appropriate for gaming environments. In this paper, we will outline several psychological and sensory effects of lighting and lighting movements. Based on analyses of movies and lighting design texts, we will present a collection of lighting methods and describe their use and impact. In addition, we will describe a case study of an informal experiment conducted as a pilot study to evaluate the aesthetic utility of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> within a game. Finally, we will discuss lessons learned, and propose a plan for further research into the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lighting</b> within video games...|$|R

50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>light</b> {{scattering}} provides {{insight into}} the dynamic properties of soft materials by measuring single scattering events, meaning that each detected photon has been scattered by the sample exactly once. However, the application to many systems of scientific and industrial relevance has been limited due to often-encountered multiple scattering, wherein photons are scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with nonnegligible contributions from multiple scattering. Especially for larger particles and those with high refractive index contrast, this limits the technique to very low particle concentrations, and a large variety of systems are, therefore, excluded from investigations with <b>dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering. However, as shown by Schaetzel, {{it is possible to}} suppress multiple scattering in <b>dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering experiments via a cross-correlation approach. The general idea is to isolate singly scattered light and suppress undesired contributions from multiple scattering in a <b>dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering experiment. Different implementations of cross-correlation light scattering have been developed and applied. Currently, the most widely used scheme is the so-called 3D-dynamic light scattering method. The same method {{can also be used to}} correct static light scattering data for multiple scattering contributions. Alternatively, in the limit of strong multiple scattering, a variant of <b>dynamic</b> <b>light</b> scattering called diffusing-wave spectroscopy can be applied.|$|E
