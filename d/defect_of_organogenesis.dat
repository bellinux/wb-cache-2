40|$|Thalidomide is an {{important}} advance {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma. In Japan thalidomide is now on the approval step for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The drug has some bothersome side effects such as <b>defect</b> <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis,</b> neuropathy, constipation and fatigue, but is likely more effective than standard chemotherapy and is changing multiple myeloma treatment. At this moment, Japanese patients must import the thalidomide preparations from Mexico, Britain and elsewhere, but after approval, they patients {{will be able to get}} the new Japanese thalidomide capsules. In order to determine appropriate amounts of Japanese thalidomide capsules in the treatment of multiple myeloma, we compared the dissolution profile and plasma thalidomide concentrations of Japanese and British capsules and Mexican tablets. The dissolution test was performed according to the Japanese and the United States Pharmacopoeia. The pharmacokinetic data for Japanese capsules were obtained from the clinical trial in Japanese subjects and compared with those data published for other formulations. The dissolution rate of the Japanese capsule was the fastest, followed by British and Mexican formulations. The pharmacokinetic profiles of Japanese and British capsules were similar, while the 100 mg Japanese thalidomide capsule demonstrated a 1. 6 -fold higher maximum plasma concentration than the 200 mg Mexican thalidomide tablet (1. 7 vs. 1. 1 μg/ml), greatly shortened t_ (4. 5 vs. 6. 2 h), and the apparent half life was only one-third of the Mexican tablet (4. 8 vs. 13. 5 h). A comparison of the dissolution and the pharmacokinetic absorption profiles demonstrated a rank-order correlation. Physicians and pharmacists should be aware of the probable alteration in plasma thalidomide concentration when switching to the Japanese capsule, especially from the Mexican tablet, and should monitor clinical response carefully...|$|E
40|$|Dear Editor, we {{read with}} great {{interest}} the paper by Alcolado [1], published in your prestigious Journal. This work conforms ‘‘the fetal basis of adult disease’’ hypothesis, which proposes that prenatal exposure to certain forms of environmental stress can cause increased susceptibility to clinical disorders, modulating the gene expression later in life (the so-called ‘‘epigenetic imprinting”). During embryogenesis, it was already shown that homeobox (Hox) genes are strictly involved in the differentiation of the paramesonephric duct into the mature female reproductive system [2]. Two weeks after birth, Hoxa 9, Hoxa 10, Hoxa 11 and Hoxa 13 develop their characteristic spatial distribution throughout the Müllerian ducts [3]. Moreover, it was demonstrated {{that the loss of}} Hoxa 10 function provokes dysregulation during decidualization and implantation, resulting in female infertility [4]. Although clear data about the role of Hoxa gene clusters in infertility remain to be elucidated, we know that Hoxa 10 specifically mediates the progesterone regulation of two prostaglandin E 2 receptors (EP 3 and EP 4) in uterine stroma [5]. Moreover, another well-known family of genes that influence remarkably the organogenesis of the Müllerian reproductive tract is Wnt (wingless-type MMTV integration site family). Failures in Wnt signaling are associated with infertility, endometriosis, endometrial cancer and gestational trophoblastic disease such as choriocarcinomas [6]. Basing on these data, it is possible that epigenetic disturbance(s) during the Müllerian reproductive tract development may lead to modified intercellular communications, dysregulation of common downstream targets and, finally, to <b>defect</b> <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis.</b> Considering that the dysregulation of Wnt and/or Hox genes may affect cell migration during organogenesis and differentiation of Müllerian structures of the female reproductive tract, these altered pathways can underlie the well-known Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome [7], clinically characterized by a physiological development of the secondary sexual characters and by a normal female karyotype 46 XX, with a congenital aplasia of the uterus and of 2 / 3 superior parts of vagina. A similar etiologic machinery was already hypothesized for endometriosis [8], a gynecological condition characterized by the breakdown of peritoneal immune homeostasis [9 – 11] and related symptoms and signs [12 – 14] due to the pro-inflammatory profile of pelvic as well as intrauterine microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) family cytokines lymphotoxin (LT) α and LTβ form heterotrimers {{that are}} expressed {{on the surface}} of activated lymphocytes and natural killer cells; LTα homotrimers can be secreted as well. Mice with a disrupted LTα gene lack lymph nodes (LN), Peyer’s patches (PP), and follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks and reveal profound <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> the splenic architecture. However, it is unclear which of these abnormalities {{is the result of the}} absence in LTα homotrimers or LTαβ heterotrimers. To distinguish between these two possibilities, a mouse strain deficient in LTβ was created employing Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting. Mice deficient in LTβ reveal severe <b>defects</b> in <b>organogenesis</b> <b>of</b> the lymphoid system similar to those of LTα−/− mice, except that mesenteric and cervical LN are present in most LTβ-deficient mice. Both LTβ- and LTα-deficient mice show significant lymphocytosis in the circulation and peritoneal cavity and lymphocytic infiltrations in lungs and liver. After immunization, PNA-positive B cell clusters were detected in the splenic white pulp of LTβ-deficient mice, but FDC networks were severely underdeveloped. Collectively, these results indicate that LTα can signal independently from LTβ in the formation of PNA-positive foci in the spleen, and especially in the development of mesenteric and cervical LN...|$|R

There have been several studies on {{the side effects of}} the drug as stress disorders, tumors, preconvulsive activities in case of epileptic attacks, overdose, and behavioral problems, but little is known regarding the teratogenicity of the drug and its effects on the craniofascial development. In this study, a group of adult wistar rats of definite average of age and weight were selected and exposed to 2 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg day of lorazepam after conception (during the organogenesis in the days 9 to 18) in case and control groups. The fetuses were first studied macroscopically regarding gross anomalies, and then histologically and histochemically to exactly inspect the <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tissue <b>organogenesis.</b> According to the results obtained, there was significant difference in the weight and length of the cases compared to the control group. Several anomalies of the eyes and ears (Coloboma of the eyelids with protruded globes and absence of the auricle and external auditory meatus), anomalies of the skull (Acrocephaly, and large rhombencephalon) were found. The craniofascial organs such as the nasal epithelium, tongue, salivary glands and the palates were also affected. According to the final analysis, there is {{a significant difference between the}} case and control groups. It was also found that taking the drug in the second half of pregnancy could affect the migration of the neural crest cells (being very sensitive) and change the mesenchymal structure of the neural crests. It also promotes the synthesis of proteins like growth hormone and growth factors.

40|$|The {{early stages}} <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis</b> in metazoans differ {{drastically}} between higher order taxa such as phyla and classes. The segmented germ band stage in insects, the nauplius stage of crustaceans, and the neurula/pharyngula stage in vertebrates {{are examples of}} this diversification. In striking contrast with this divergence, is the similarity of these stages within these taxa, i. e., within insects, crustaceans, and vertebrates. The early stages <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis,</b> or phylotypic stages, have, thus, remained very similar in most species since the evolutionary origin of the taxa. These phylotypic stages are considerably more similar to each other than to the earlier stages of cleavage and gastrulation. Cleavage and gastrulation stages display not only great variability, but also striking examples of apparent convergence among species in different phyla, for example in the many cases of epiblastic cleavage in yolk-rich eggs. This leads to the paradoxical situation that the overall similarity of cleavage and gastrulation stages is in general higher among metazoans than of the early stages <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis,</b> but within phyla and classes the situation is the reverse. We discuss data on cleavage, gastrulation, and early organogenesis and evaluate possible causes for conservation, homoplasy, and diversification {{in an attempt to}} throw light on this paradoxical situation.

Many {{species in the}} genus Kalanchoë, known as “mother of thousands,” develop plantlets on the leaf margins.

Here, we report that constitutive plantlet-forming species, like Kalanchoë daigremontiana, form plantlets by coopting both organogenesis and embryogenesis programs into leaves. These species have a defective LEC 1 gene and produce nonviable seed, whereas species that produce plantlets only upon stress induction have an intact LEC 1 gene and produce viable seed. The latter species are basal in the genus, suggesting that induced-plantlet formation and seed viability are ancestral traits.

Furthermore, we identify seven dominant patterns of gene expression during gastrulation and organogenesis.

40|$|Function of {{the heart}} begins long before its {{formation}} is complete. Analyses in mouse and zebrafish have shown that myocardial function is not required for early steps <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis,</b> such as formation {{of the heart}} tube or chamber specification. However, whether myocardial function is required for later steps of cardiac development, such as endocardial cushion (EC) formation, has not been established. Recent technical advances and approaches have provided novel inroads toward the study <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis,</b> allowing us {{to examine the effects}} of both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of myocardial function on EC formation in zebrafish. To address whether myocardial function is required for EC formation, we examined s ilent heart (sih -/-) embryos, which lack a heartbeat due to mutation of cardiac troponin T (tnnt 2), and observed that atrioventricular (AV) ECs do not form. Likewise, we determined that cushion formation is blocked in cardiofunk (cfk -/-) embryos, which exhibit cardiac dilation and no early blood flow. In order to further analyze the heart defects in cfk -/- embryos, we positionally cloned cfk and show that it encodes a novel sarcomeric actin expressed in the embryonic myocardium. The Cfk s 11 variant exhibits a change in a universally conserved residue (R 177 H). We show that in yeast this mutation negatively affects actin polymerization. Because the lack of cushion formation in sih- and cfk- mutant embryos could be due to reduced myocardial function and/or lack of blood flow, we approached this question pharmacologically and provide evidence that reduction in myocardial function is primarily responsible for the defect in cushion development. Our data demonstrate that early myocardial function is required for later steps <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis</b> and suggest that myocardial function, not endothelial shear stress, is the major epigenetic factor controlling late heart development. Based on these observations, we postulate that defects in cardiac morphogenesis may be secondary to mutations affecting early myocardial function, and that, in humans, mutations affecting embryonic myocardial function may be responsible for structural congenital heart disease. </p...|$|R

40|$|Owing to its {{optical clarity}} and rapid rate of development, the {{zebrafish}} embryo {{is an ideal}} model system for studying the cellular mechanics <b>of</b> <b>organogenesis.</b> Unfortunately, extended time-lapse recordings of zebrafish embryos are often disrupted by the extension and straightening of the embryonic axis, as well as movement artifacts associated with developing musculature. In addition, the embryo's massive yolk cell often prevents optical access to tissues of interest. To circumvent these imaging problems, we have developed a procedure to deflate and mechanically remove the yolk cell. A "paralyzing" agent, AMP-PNP (a membrane-impermeant nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP), is first injected into the embryo's contractile yolk cell. The yolk cell is then removed using sharpened tungsten needles. Deyolked embryos, or organ rudiments explanted from them, are then immobilized on a microscope coverslip using a thin plasma clot. This plasma clot immobilization allows novel mountings of the explants so that ventral, lateral, and even cross-sectional fields of views are possible using high numerical aperture objectives.
