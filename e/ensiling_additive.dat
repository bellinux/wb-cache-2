The main objective of the submitted study was {{to assess the impact of}} added topsoil layer and ensiling additives on the hygienic quality of the experimental silages. In the model experiment, we used alfalfa from the second cut. In total, the experiment included 9 various treatments in three repetitions. Use was made of the variants of experimental silages P 0, P 20, P 40 (without <b>ensiling</b> <b>additive),</b> B 0, B 20, B 40 (treated with a biological <b>ensiling</b> <b>additive)</b> and CH 0, CH 20, CH 40 (treated with a chemical <b>ensiling</b> <b>additive)</b> always with an addition of a surface layer of soil in a quantity of 0, 20 and 40 g/kg of dry matter. The model silages were assessed after 10 -week storage. A representative sample was taken from each experimental variant to perform a microbiological analysis. In the experiment, the counts of clostridia colonies, sporulating microorganisms, anaerobic microorganisms, total number of microorganisms (CPM), lactic acid bacteria, moulds and yeasts were observed. Statistically conclusive difference in the topsoil layer addition was only proved in CPM between variants P 20 (1. 96 E+ 07 ± 6. 21 E+ 06) and P 40 (4. 97 E+ 07 ± 1. 89 E+ 07) and bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family between variants P 0 (2. 17 E+ 02 ± 3. 32 E+ 01) and P 40 (3. 64 E+ 01 ± 2. 57 E+ 01).

40|$|Although forage lipid is {{generally}} rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), recovery of these fatty acids (FA) in milk and meat of ruminant origin {{is generally}} low, due to microbial biohydrogenation (BH) {{taking place in}} the rumen. Since lipolysis is a prerequisite for BH, the latter process is expected to be enhanced when (conserved) forages contain lower levels of esterified FA (particularly polar lipids; PL). However, this was not observed in former studies with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Furthermore, red clover inclusion in the herbivore's diet was associated with decreased rumen BH as compared with other forages. Differences in plant lipase activity during wilting and ensiling has been attributed to changes in disappearance from the PL fraction, but a potential role of microbial lipases in silo has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to assess whether BH of red clover FA is linked with PL levels of the (conserved) starting material and to clarify the possible role of in silo microbial activity on PL disappearance. In order to obtain sufficient variation in forage PL and microbial activity, laboratory-scale silages were made by wilting and ensiling damaged or undamaged red clover using molasses or formic acid as <b>ensiling</b> <b>additive,</b> while perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was used as a control. Distribution of lipids within three lipid fractions (PL, free FA and neutral lipids) in forages was determined and BH calculated after 24 h in vitro rumen incubation. Results indicated microbial lipases in silages did not enhance FA disappearance from the PL fraction. A gradual decrease of FA in the PL fraction upon conservation was found, both in red clover and ryegrass, irrespective of the degree of damage. In red clover PL losses started from the wilting phase, while substantial PL disappearance from ryegrass only started upon ensiling. Proportions of PUFA remaining in the PL fraction after wilting and ensiling of red clover were positively correlated with PUFA BH, while this effect was not observed for ryegrass. Red clover PUFA seemed to be partially protected against ruminal BH, while disappearance of FA from the PL fraction {{did not seem to be}} hampered. Results indicated the encapsulation mechanism as a consequence of protein-bound phenol formation induced by polyphenol oxidase is still the most probable hypothesis to explain red clover's increased flow of PUFA across the rumen...|$|E

Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without <b>additive</b> contained 141 g crude proteins (CP) kg- 1 DM, which was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) compared to alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with <b>additive</b> (139 g CP kg- 1 DM). Alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> with <b>additive</b> contained significantly less acid detergent fibers (ADF) (P< 0. 001) compared to alfalfa <b>ensiled</b> without <b>additive</b> (445 g kg- 1 DM and 456 g kg- 1 DM, respectively) and had a lower pH value (P< 0. 001) (5. 29 and 5. 56, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found between the studied feeding treatments for ad libitum intake of fresh ration and DM ration, for the measured parameters of digestibility and N balance.

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} quality of model silages made of wilted grass biomass and treated with silage additives. Grass species used for the {{production}} of silages were Lolium perenne, Festulolium pabulare and Festulolium braunii harvested in the first cut at the stage of earing. The assessed grass species were wilted after the cut for an identical time 36 hours (2008), resp. 24 hours (2009). The treatment was made either with a chemical preparation (formic acid, propionic acid, ammonium formate) and/or with a bio­lo­gi­cal inoculant (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus salivarius, cellulase, hemicellulase and amylase). The amount of the chemical ingredient was 4 [*]l .  t− 1 and the amount of the biological additive was 10 [*]g .  t− 1. The biomass was after wilting ensilaged in con­tai­ners whose diameter and height were 0. 15 [*]m and 0. 64 [*]m, respectively. After 60 days of ensilaging, the silages were assessed for pH, organic acids content, ethanol content and acidity of water extract (AWE); organic nutrients assessed in the silages were crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), crude protein (CP) and digestibility of organic matter (DOM). Hygienic safety was assessed from the contents of zearalenon, fumonisin and aflatoxin mycotoxins. The high (P < 0. 05) dry matter (DM) content in Festulolium pabulare silages indicates that the species tends to rapid wilting. The higher DM content reflected in lower biomass losses (P < 0. 05). The lowest pH values (P < 0. 05) were detected in silages made of Festulolium braunii. The fact relates to the higher content of lactic acid in the prepared microsilages. The use of <b>ensiling</b> <b>additives</b> affected {{the quality of}} extracts. Namely the application of the biological additive led to the increased content (P < 0. 05) of not only lactic acid but acetic acid too. Titrable acidity was not affected by the <b>ensiling</b> <b>additives.</b> As to the emanation of ethanol, heterofermentative bacteria of lactic fermentation apparently took part in the fermentation process of the silages as well. While the evaluated forage species showed differences in the di­ges­ti­bi­li­ty of organic matter (P < 0. 05), the application of preservatives did not influence the content of organic nutrients. Fumonisin was not detected at all and aflatoxins were below the level of detection.

The study compared energy and GHG balances of transport biofuels produced in Finnish conditions. Energy and GHG balances were calculated from a life cycle perspective for biogas when timothy-clover and reed canary grass silages and green manure of an organic farm were used as a raw material. The results were compared with published data on barley-based ethanol, rape methyl ester (biodiesel) and biowaste-based biogas. The energy input for biogas was 22 – 37 % of the output depending on the raw material. The GHG emissions from field-based biogas were 21 – 36 % of emissions from fossil-based fuels. The largest energy input was used in the processing of the biofuels while most of the greenhouse gases were emitted during farming. The GHG emissions of the field-based biogas were emitted mainly from fuels of farming machinery, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions of the soil and the production of <b>ensiling</b> <b>additives.</b> The energy efficiency was most sensitive to the methane yield, and GHG emissions to the N 2 O emissions.

However, no comprehensive dataset is available to estimate fat and FA content and composition of forages. This study used the available data on fat and FA content and composition of forages to (i) compute mean composition values for the main forages, and (ii) estimate the influence of forage conservation, cultivation and harvest conditions on fat and FA content and composition. We report mean values for the main forage species in the form of fresh forage, silage or hay. The main factor influencing fat and FA composition was vegetation stage of forage at harvest (estimated by the month of harvest or regrowth interval). Compared with fresh forage at harvest, wilting or drying forages (especially in bad drying conditions) altered their FA, whereas unwilted silage, the use of <b>ensiling</b> <b>additives</b> and N fertilization had only minor effects. The differences between grass (except corn) and legume species were lower than those induced by vegetation stage and wilting or drying. We gave equations to estimate the effects of these factors and thus refine the estimation of the FA content and composition of the forages. Total FA content and proportion of linolenic acid were positively related to crude protein, and negatively related to fiber content of the forages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{of blood}} plasma of 60 cows {{selected}} on six Flemish organic dairy farms revealed that on average 12 % of all samples {{and on one}} farm up to 28 % of the organic cows showed plasma vitamin E concentrations less than 3. 0 μg/ml, which is considered the minimum level to avoid health risks due to vitamin E shortages. Furthermore, this study showed early lactating and dry cows to be more at risk in relation to animals in mid-late lactation. In European organic farming, vitamin supplements are only allowed if granted by the local authority to satisfy daily requirements. Therefore, the vitamin E content of the feedstuffs used on the farms was determined. Grass clover silage (GCS) and mixed silage had significantly more vitamin E than hay, maize or grain (p < 0. 05) [mean (SD) : 52 (35), 29 (20), 4. 5 (1. 7), 4. 9 (4. 4) and 7. 1 (3. 8) mg/kg DM, respectively]. Apparently, variation in the vitamin E content in the silage samples was huge. Hence, the vitamin E content of ryegrass, white and red clover was determined in a second lab scale experiment {{and the effects of}} wilting, DM content and supplementation of <b>ensiling</b> <b>additives</b> were investigated. Fresh ryegrass had a higher vitamin E content than white and red clover (p < 0. 05) [156 (11. 3), 49. 3 (0. 67) and 74. 3 (5. 73) μg/g DM, respectively]. These differences remained after the wilting or ensiling. Supplementation of formic acid or lactic acid bacteria at ensiling had no significant effect on the vitamin E content.

However, some issues for a biorefinery are that its composition {{as well as}} availability varies seasonally and a fresh source cannot be provided all year around. To secure a steady biomass supply the harvest has to be preserved and today drying (especially sun-drying) is commonly used for seaweeds in the carrageenan industry. In colder climates, however, relying on sun-drying could be more problematic and energy intensive drying utilizing hot air is the alternative. An alternative method is ensiling, which is common in agriculture for preserving animal feed. Ensiling is not well researched for seaweeds, though it is receiving more and more attention.

The variables analyzed were: nutritional value, losses due to gases and effluents, and dry matter recovery. The use of dried citrus pulp or soybean hulls at the ensiling time increased the dry matter content (29. 4 and 28, 9 %) and decreased the effluent production (4. 1 and 3. 8 kg/t of fresh matter), also providing fermentable substrate to microorganisms, resulting in increased fermentation coefficient and digestibility of silages. The use of formic acid resulted in silages with higher digestibility and increased water-soluble carbohydrates and crude protein content. This additive was also effective in reducing the losses due to gases and, as a result, increased the total dry matter recovery. The treatment containing homolactic bacteria showed similar trend of increasing the digestibility and reducing the losses due to gases.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the kinetics of ruminal fermentation dry matter and car-bohydrates of two varieties of sugar cane <b>ensiled</b> with different <b>additives</b> using a semiautomatic technique in vitro gas production. We used a completely randomized design with a factorial 2 x 5, two varieties of cane sug-ar (RB 86 7515 and IAC 86 2480) and five additives (urea, NaOH, CaO, corn and L. buchneri) and without additive treatments, with the opening of the silos being made at 60 days after ensiling. Pressure readings were performed on days 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 10; 12; 15; 19; 24; 30; 36; 48; 72 and 96 h. The pressure caused by organic matter was recorded in a pressure transducer universal and for adjusting the parameters kinetic model was used bicompartmental. The technique of in vitro gas production satisfactorily estimated the volume of gases from silage and sugarcane raw. The higher gas volume fraction of fiber was not in IAC 86 2480, with the additive NaOH. In the fiber fraction only difference between varieties with the additive urea, and the IAC 86 2480 that had the highest volume.

40|$|AbstractEnsiling {{conditions}} strongly influence fermentation characteristics, yeast count, and aerobic stability. Numerous {{volatile organic}} compounds including esters are produced, which may negatively affect feed intake and animal performance and air quality. In addition to a farm survey, 3 laboratory experiments were carried out to {{study the effects of}} air (by delayed sealing or by air infiltration during anaerobic storage), temperature (20 and 35 °C), and various types of additives [blends of either sodium benzoate and sodium propionate (SBSP) or of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (SBPS); buffered mixture of formic and propionic acids (FAPA); homofermentative inoculant (LAB) ]. After additive treatment, chopped whole corn plants were packed into 1. 5 -L glass jars and stored for several months. For treatments with air infiltration, glass jars with holes in the lid and body were used. The farm survey in 2009 revealed large variation in lactate, acetate, ethanol, n-propanol, and 1, 2 -propanediol concentrations. Whereas ethyl esters were detected in all silages, the mean ethyl lactate concentrations were higher than those for ethyl acetate (474 vs. 38 mg/kg of dry matter). In the ensiling experiments, few unequivocal effects of the tested factors on the analyzed parameters were observed due to many interactions. Delayed <b>ensiling</b> without <b>additives</b> decreased lactic acid production but, in one trial, increased acetic acid and had no effect on ethanol. The effect of delayed sealing on yeast counts and aerobic stability differed widely among experiments. Air infiltration during fermentation tested in one trial did not alter lactic acid production, but resulted in more acetic acid in delayed and more ethanol than in promptly sealed untreated silages. Greater ethanol production was associated with increased yeast numbers. Storage at high temperature resulted in lower lactic acid and n-propanol, and a trend toward reduced ethanol production was observed. The additive FAPA consistently caused increased ethanol and reduced n-propanol levels with no effect on yeast counts and aerobic stability. When the additives SBSP and SBPS decreased n-propanol and ethanol, reduced yeast counts were also found. Ethyl ester formation was strongly correlated with those of ethanol and to a lesser degree with those of the respective acid...|$|R

No experimento 1, a cana-de-açúcar foi ensilada sem aditivo ou inoculada com cepas NCIMB 40788 do Lactobacillus buchneri (5 x 10 (4) ufc/g de matéria verde). Amostras das silagens foram analisadas e comparadas à cana-de-açúcar in natura para avaliação da estabilidade aeróbia, considerando os dados de temperatura, pH e perdas de MS das silagens. No experimento 2, utilizaram-se 12 cordeiros distribuídos em blocos completos casualizados e mantidos em gaiolas para ensaio de metabolismo recebendo rações contendo cana-de-açúcar in natura, silagem de cana-de-açúcar sem aditivo ou silagem de cana-de-açúcar tratada com Lactobacillus buchneri. Os teores de matéria seca, carboidratos solúveis e ácido acético foram maiores na silagem com aditivo. O teor de etanol não diferiu entre as silagens. A silagem tratada com aditivo apresentou menor perda de matéria seca e manutenção do pH durante o período de avaliação em aerobiose. A digestibilidade aparente de fibra em detergente neutro, fibra em detergente ácido e hemicelulose foram maiores nas rações contendo silagem de cana-de-açúcar. Two {{trials were}} {{performed}} to evaluate the nutritive value and aerobic stability of sugar cane silage, as well as apparent digestibility of diets containing these silages. In trial 1, sugar cane was <b>ensiled</b> without <b>additive</b> or inoculated with strains NCIMB 40788 of Lactobacillus buchneri (5 x 10 (4) cfu/g wet basis). Silages were sampled, analyzed, and compared with fresh sugar cane. Aerobic stability was evaluated by controlling the temperature, pH, and dry matter losses of the silages. In trial 2, twelve lambs were assigned to a complete randomized block design and placed in metabolism crates and fed with diets composed by fresh sugar cane, sugar cane silage without additive, or sugar cane silage treated with Lactobacillus buchneri. Dry matter, soluble carbohydrates, and acetic acid concentrations were higher for silage treated with Lactobacillus buchneri when compared with silage without additive. There was no difference on ethanol levels between silages. Sugar cane silage treated with Lactobacillus buchneri showed lower dry matter losses, unchanged pH, and greater aerobic stability.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is {{intended}} to be added to forages to promote the <b>ensiling</b> process (technological <b>additive,</b> functional group: silage additive). The identity of the strain and its susceptibility to relevant antibiotics has been established. However, the strain produces cyclic lipopeptides which possess potent surfactant activity, known to be involved in food intoxication. Although the strain is intended for use only in the production of silage, as a spore former it will survive the ensiling process and be ingested by target animals. The spores will also survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of animals and be a potential source of contamination of food of animal origin and of the environment. The greatest risk would be to those handling the product on farm following oral, dermal and respiratory exposure. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that use of the strain in the production of silage presents a hazard to consumers, users and the environment, and potentially also to the target animals. A total of three laboratory experiments with laboratory-scale silos, each lasting at least 90 days, were carried out using samples of forage of differing dry matter and water-soluble carbohydrate content. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared with identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. The potential of the additive to improve aerobic stability of silages at the proposed dose of 5. 0 x 107 CFU/kg fresh materials was not convincingly demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Urea is Commonly {{used as a}} feed {{additive}} to improve the quantity of nitrogen (N) and digestibility in ruminants. Supplementation of urea increases crude protein but decreases the fermentation quality of silage with increasing pH by releasing ammonia N. Thus, oxalic acid diamide （oxamide, O） and guanyl urea sulfate （GW）, N slow-release compounds, were used as additives in the present study. As much as 650 grams of the napiergrass were ensiled into a laboratory silo （ 1. 0 liiter Polyethylene container）. The treatment were : no additive （control）, O, O+glucose （OG）, GU and GU+glucose （GUG）. O and GU were added {{at the level of}} 0. 23 % N on the napiergrass fresh weight basis, and glucose was added at 1 %. Silage was incubated for 7, 15, 30 and 60 days at room temperature （ 28 ℃）. After the silo was opened, pH, contents of dry matter, total nitrogen （TN）, volatile basic nitrogen （VBN） and organic acids were determined. Compared with the control, OG, GU and GUG treatments significantly decreased pH values, VBN/TN, acetic acid and butyric acid contents, and significantly increased contents of dry matter, TN and lactic acid after 60 days of fermentation. The length of storage did not affect dry matter, lactic acid and TN contents and VBN/TN. In conclusion, without glucose addition GU may be a good N supplement for silage marking of Rapiergrass, but glucose is necessary to improve fermentation quality when <b>ensiled</b> with O <b>additive...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of a whole spectrum of gasses, which is undesirable occurs during ensiling process. The {{formation of}} gasses is undesirable, because it is often a sign of undesirable processes in silages, and causes concern about {{the impact on the}} global environment. Formation of CO 2 is the most abundant. Besides CO 2, the formation of toxic N oxides also occurs during <b>ensiling.</b> Since silage <b>additive</b> addition affects the fermentation pattern, the aim {{of the study was to}} monitor the formation of various gasses from silages treated with different silage additives. A grass ley (70 % timothy) was harvested on August 24 th 2013, nearby Helsingborg. Bacterial inoculant (E. faecium, L. plantarum, L. buchneri) at the rate of 250000 cfu/g FF, and silage additive Safesil at the rate of 3 L/ton FF were compared with untreated control. Gasses collected in bags were analysed for N 2, H 2, O 2, CO, CH 4 by gas chromatographaphy. CO 2, NO, and NO 2 were absorbed in water and analysed using ion chromatography. Standard analyses to determine silage quality were performed after ensiling period. Silages treated with bacterial inoculant had significantly higher pH, propionic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol contents but lower concentration of lactic acid than other silage treatments. Control and bacterially inoculated silages produced more gas than Safesil treated silages, mainly due to an increased proportion of CO 2. The formation of NOx gases displayed no significant differences among other treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine effect of additive supplementation to red clover silage on ad libitum intake of fresh silage and dry matter (DM), in vivo digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), OM in DM (D-value), crude protein (CP) and nitrogen (N) balance. Red clover was harvested at 60 % bloom stage. It was ensiled into round bales without an additive (CD) and with an additive supplementation (CDA) in the amount of 2 L t- 1 fresh material. Statistically lower (P< 0. 001) DM content was recorded in CD (405 g kg- 1 fresh sample) in comparison with CDA (665 g ST kg- 1 fresh sample). Statistically higher CP content (P< 0. 001) was recorded in CD (127 g kg- 1 ST) in comparison with CDA (110 g SP kg- 1 ST). CD had lower pH (P< 0. 001) (4. 9) in comparison with CDA (5. 2). No differences were recorded in NH 3 between treatments. Ad libitum intake of fresh silage and silage DM was higher (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 01, respectively) in CD in comparison with CDA. Digestibility of DM, OM, CP, D-value and N balance were not different between treatments. It was concluded that the positive effect of additive supplementation to red clover silage on chemical composition, ad libitum intake, digestibility and N balance was not recorded due to applied <b>ensiling</b> technology as <b>additive</b> can improve feeding value of roughage, but it is not a replacement for good management practices...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the chemical composition and the fermentative parameters of heart of palm waste produced from Alexander Palm, <b>ensiled</b> with chemical <b>additives.</b> Treatments consisted of silage of the sheath with or without calcium oxide. In the silage without calcium oxide, we evaluated the control silage (without additive) and the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 urea (urea). In the silage with calcium oxide, we evaluated the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (control) and the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 urea and 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (urea). Experimental silos were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (inclusion or lack of lime × inclusion or lack of urea), with four replicates. Crude protein concentration was greater in the silages that received urea, whereas in the case of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, the lowest levels were found in the control silage. Control silage had the lowest pH (3. 75) and the silages that received lime displayed the lowest lactic acid content. Effluent losses were greater in the control silage and in the silage with lime (56. 1 kg t− 1 and 58. 4 kg t− 1, respectively). Silages prepared with waste from heart of palm production and enriched only with urea showed a better chemical composition and improved fermentation parameter estimates. We recommend the use of this waste only with additives that can improve the chemical characteristics of the forage.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate whether oil palm frond (OPF) can be successfully ensiled without or with the additives cellulase or lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Thus, fresh OPF was <b>ensiled</b> either without <b>additives</b> or with cellulase or LAB or their combination. Ensiling was carried out by storing 2 kg samples in airtight glass jars at 25 - 30 °C for 12 weeks. Thereafter, the silage samples were subjected to proximate analyses, an in vitro digestibility assay and measures on selected indices of fermentation. Fermentation of OPF without additives appeared to be unsuccessful as both pH and ammonia content were too high (4. 9 and 9. 9 %, respectively). In contrast, the use of cellulase or LAB resulted in silages with a pH< 4. 5 and ammonia fractions < 8. 4 %, but the lowest values were found when both cellulase and LAB were used, i. e. pH= 4. 1 and ammonia fraction= 6. 7 %. In vitro digestibility of dry matter was significantly higher in the cellulase treated silages. The process of ensiling was associated with both a significant decrease of the fat content of OPF and a significant change of the fatty acid profile. However, the proportions of major fatty acids (C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 2 n- 6) were not affected by the process of ensiling. In conclusion, the use of cellulase additive appears a practical tool to safeguard the process of fermentation. Using a cellulase enzyme or its combination with LAB improves the fermentation profile and increases the nutritional value of the OPF silage...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the fermentation profile of orange bagasse ensiled with {{three levels of}} dry matter (DM) using citrus pulp pellets as a moisture-absorbing additive. Thirty experimental silos (3 treatments, 5 storage times, 2 replicates) were prepared using 25 -liter plastic buckets containing orange bagasse and three levels of pelleted citrus pulp (0, 6 % and 20 %) as additive. A completely randomized design with repeated measures over time was used. The periods of anaerobic storage were 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days. Natural orange bagasse contained 13. 9 % DM, which increased to 19. 1 % and 25. 5 % with the inclusion of 6 % and 20 % citrus pulp pellets, respectively. The apparent density was inversely correlated with DM content and {{a higher level of}} compaction (982 kg/m 3) was observed in the mass ensiled with the lowest DM level (13. 9 %). Additionally, lower compaction (910 kg/m 3) was found in the mass <b>ensiled</b> with the <b>additive.</b> The chemical composition of the mass ensiled with or without citrus pulp pellets did not differ significantly in terms of protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, lignin or in vitro DM digestibility (P≥ 0. 05), as expected. Thus, it was possible to analyze only the effect of the inclusion of citrus pulp pellets on the increase in DM content. The inclusion of 20 % of the additive reduced (P< 0. 01) losses due to effluent (98 % less) and gas production (81 % less) compared to the control treatment {{at the end of the}} anaerobic storage period. In this treatment, a higher (P≤ 0. 05) log number of lactic acid bacteria (4. 61 log CFU/g) was also observed compared to the other treatments, indicating that the increase in DM favored the growth of these bacteria. In addition, the low yeast count (about 1 log CFU/g sample) and the pH below 4. 0, which were probably due to the production of lactic and acetic acids, show that the orange bagasse is rich in fermentable soluble carbohydrates and is indicated for ensiling. In conclusion, orange bagasse can be efficiently conserved as silage if the initial DM content is at least 25 %. The inclusion of 20 % (in relation to orange bagasse weight) citrus pulp pellets as moisture-absorbing additive is recommended to guarantee adequate fermentation and to reduce losses inherent to the ensiling process...|$|R

Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em arranjo fatorial 3 × 5, com três teores de matéria seca (obtidos com adição de polpa cítrica (PCP) ou casca de soja (CSP), ambas peletizadas, em comparação à ausência de aditivos) e cinco aditivos (ausência ou presença de inoculante bacteriano, benzoato de sódio ou ácido fórmico 62 % ou 44 %). O arranjo resultou em 15 silagens, com 4 repetições, portanto 60 silos experimentais. Avaliaram-se o valor nutritivo, as perdas por gases e efluente e a recuperação de matéria seca (MS). A adição de polpa cítrica ou casca de soja peletizada elevou os teores de MS (29, 4 e 28, 9 %), o que reduziu a produção de efluente (4, 1 e 3, 8 kg/t MV) e disponibilizou substratos fermentescíveis aos microrganismos, fato confirmado pela maior capacidade fermentativa e pela digestibilidade das silagens. Os aditivos à base de ácido fórmico foram mais efetivos em preservar carboidratos solúveis e proteína, o que culminou em maior digestibilidade. Esses aditivos também reduziram as perdas por gases e elevaram a recuperação de MS. O inoculante contendo bactérias homoláticas não diferiu desses aditivos quanto à digestibilidade das silagens e ainda reduziu as perdas por gases. Entre os aditivos, o benzoato foi o menos efetivo em alterar o padrão fermentativo das silagens de capim-marandu. O valor nutritivo e as perdas da silagem com teor de umidade original, não aditivada, podem ser considerados satisfatórios, contudo, a polpa cítrica e principalmente a casca de soja peletizadas se mostraram opção interessante e devem ser mais estudadas. O uso de aditivos contendo ácido fórmico também deve ser mais explorado com gramíneas tropicais, pois promove benefícios ao longo de todo processo fermentativo. The {{objective}} of this trial was to evaluate the nutritional value, fermentation profile and dry matter losses of Palisadegrass silages ensiled with either dried citrus pulp, soybean hulls, chemical or microbial additives. The trial {{was carried out in}} a completely randomized experimental design and in a factorial arrangement (3 × 5), with three dry matter levels (wet forage or forage ensiled with pelleted citrus pulp or pelleted soybean hulls) and five additives (without or with the presence of bacterial inoculants or the addition of: sodium benzoate, formic acid in the concentration of 62 % or 44 %), totalizing 15 treatments and 60 experimental silos. The variables analyzed were: nutritional value, losses due to gases and effluents, and dry matter recovery. The use of dried citrus pulp or soybean hulls at the ensiling time increased the dry matter content (29. 4 and 28, 9 %) and decreased the effluent production (4. 1 and 3. 8 kg/t of fresh matter), also providing fermentable substrate to microorganisms, resulting in increased fermentation coefficient and digestibility of silages. The use of formic acid resulted in silages with higher digestibility and increased water-soluble carbohydrates and crude protein content. This additive was also effective in reducing the losses due to gases and, as a result, increased the total dry matter recovery. The treatment containing homolactic bacteria showed similar trend of increasing the digestibility and reducing the losses due to gases. The use of sodium benzoate was less effective in altering the fermentation pattern of tropical silages. The nutritional value and total dry matter losses of silages <b>ensiled</b> without <b>additives</b> can be considered satisfactory.
