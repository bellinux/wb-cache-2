2500|$|A 6-cylinder {{version of}} the Liberty L-12, nicknamed the [...] "Liberty Six", {{consisted}} of a single bank of cylinders, with the resulting <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> a strong external resemblance to both the Mercedes D.III and BMW III straight-six German aviation engines of World War I.|$|E
2500|$|The C.23 BN.2 was {{designed}} to be a night bomber able to reach Berlin with a [...] bomb load. The French BN.2 military category indicated a two-seat night bomber but the C.23 had a crew of three. It had a much in common with the Caudron C.22 but was almost 50% larger in span, requiring an extra bay and more powerful engines. It was a large five bay biplane, with fabric covered, constant chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which carried the ailerons, had a slightly greater (4%) span and a smaller chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> struts, which supported the two neatly cowled [...] Salmson 9Z nine cylinder water-cooled radial engines just above the lower wing, defined the inner two bays.|$|E

2500|$|The last 'official' trains {{from and}} to Roxburgh ran on Friday 31 May 1968. [...] The goods train leaving Roxburgh bound for Milton at 10am that morning {{included}} three attached [...] passenger carriages. Earlier {{in the week}} the carriages had also been attached to a goods train from Millers Flat to Lawrence and back. The cars on the final train carried some 150 children and adults on an excursion organised by the local Teviot Fruitgrowers Association. [...] The carriages exchanged trains at Lawrence, where {{the up and down}} trains normally crossed. The speed of the trains carrying the passengers that day were limited to 15 miles per hour throughout the journey due to poor track conditions. [...] On the return journey into Roxburgh that afternoon a flimsy wooden barricade constructed two miles north of Millers Flat, created by locals protesting the closure of the line, was knocked aside by the advancing train, which barely slowed, to the cheers of its passengers. That last official train steamed into the autumn Roxburgh sunset at 4:50pm to the strains of [...] "Now Is the Hour", the Last Post" [...] and a swansong of whistles from the <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> the words [...] "Last Puffing Engine" [...] on its nose headboard. [...] The Minister of Railways, the Hon J.B Gordon, was given three cheers in the Roxburgh station and, although not present, was presented anonymously with a large bag of chaff.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this manner}} is an engine treated for navicular, laminitis, back-sinew, or {{whatever}} it is that engines most suffer from. No. 607, we will say, goes wrong at Dinapore, Assensole, Buxar, or wherever it may be, after three years' work. The place she came from is stencilled on the boiler, and the foreman examines her. Then he fills in a hospital sheet, which bears one hundred and eighty printed heads under which an engine can come into the shops. No. 607 needs repair in only one hundred and eighteen particulars, ranging from mud-hole-flanges and blower-cocks to lead-plugs, and platform brackets which have shaken loose. This certificate the foreman signs, and it is framed near the engine {{for the benefit of the}} three Europeans and the eight or nine natives who have to mend No. 607. To the ignorant the superhuman wisdom of the examiner seems only equalled by the audacity of the two men and the boy who are to undertake what is frivolously called the [...] "job." [...] No. 607 is in a sorely mangled condition, but 403 is much worse. She is reduced to a shell--is a very elle-woman of an <b>engine,</b> <b>bearing</b> only her funnel, the iron frame and the saddle that supports the boiler.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a wide {{analysis performed on}} the most actual methods for prediction of the reciprocating <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> behaviour. In the modern IC engines design, it is of great importance the availability of advanced simulation tools that allow to consider a number of physical effects parameters grown important due to the increasing in the specific power. In particular for the crank mechanism bearings, i. e. crankshaft main, conrod and gudgeon bearings, an analysis based on Thermo-Elasto-Hydroynamic Lubrication (TEHD), is need that keeps into account the structural and dynamic aspects of the whole engine, is needed. This paper gives an analysis on the most actual methods for prediction of the reciprocating <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> behaviour and shows some tests performed by AVL-EXCITE, a commercial code of interest for ELASIS...|$|R

40|$|While {{operation}} a {{gas turbine}} engine more modest methods of research are brought into effect. But {{one of the basic}} methods to estimate the technical condition of gas turbine <b>engines</b> <b>bearing</b> is oil analysis. To estimate the technical condition of gas turbine <b>engines</b> <b>bearing</b> systems on the basis of oil research on, an x-ray method of radio-isotope fluorescence was used. This method has been also satisfactorily used in aircraft engine diagnosis. This paper presents the method of diagnosis bearings of marine gas turbines on the basis of studies of mechanical contamination in oil. Results of mechanical contamination research in oil vs time of engine work are presented. On the basis of experiments results the analytical function that makes calculating the future value of the process possible was chosen...|$|R
5000|$|The sporty Pacer sedan was {{available}} again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered {{with the one}} power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 {{different versions of the}} new 245 Hemi-6 engine, though Chrysler Australia didn't publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced [...] Option E31 produced [...] and included a two-barrel carburettor, higher-performance camshaft, smaller fan, and windage tray. Option E34 produced [...] and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller fan, windage tray, premium <b>engine</b> <b>bearings,</b> shot-peened crankshaft and connecting rods, and high-capacity oil pump. Option E35 included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty <b>engine</b> <b>bearings,</b> a dual-plate clutch, torque-limiting engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{lubricated}} by an [...] "oiler", essentially a tank mounted {{under the seat}} which had several adjustable drip feeds with separate lines to the <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> and other areas. All components of the transmission were exposed, so several bearings and pivots had to be oiled or greased manually from time to time.|$|R

50|$|The first Audi product {{built by}} the joint venture, a {{modified}} Audi 100 with V6 <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> the model designation Audi 200, went into production in May 1996. The Audi 200 remained in production until summer 1999 (facelift of the Audi 100) with 2.6 and 2.4 litre V6 engines and the 4-cylinder, 1.8 litre turbo power unit. The content manufactured locally at the Changchun plant was 60 percent.|$|E
50|$|On steam locomotives, access {{would be}} {{impossible}} during running, so in some cases centralised mechanical lubricators were used. These devices comprised a large oil tank with a multiple-outlet pump which fed the <b>engine's</b> <b>bearings</b> through a pipe system. Lubrication of the engine's internal valves was done by adding oil to the steam supply, using a displacement lubricator.|$|R
50|$|An enquiry {{into the}} ship's loss failed to {{establish}} a cause of the fire. The repeated overheating of the <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> has been cited as suggesting that the fire may have started in the engine room. However, such overheating might also be expected to cause the engines to seize, whereas they continued to run as the fire spread.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, BMW and Junkers {{were working}} on [...] "official" [...] {{turbojet}} <b>engines</b> (<b>bearing</b> RLM-issued [...] "109-0xx" [...] design numbers, used for all gas-turbine propulsion aircraft powerplants) for the German military. These were axial-flow turbojets, which promised much less drag than the centrifugal-flow turbojets like those being developed at Heinkel and by Frank Whittle in England.|$|R
50|$|For 1986, the {{new works}} 962C of Hans-Joachim Stuck, Derek Bell and Al Holbert {{was able to}} {{overcome}} the two-time defending winners at Joest Racing. The race itself was marred {{by the death of}} Jo Gartner in a crash on the Mulsanne Straight early on Sunday morning. The sole remaining Kremer Racing Porsche retired soon after the accident. The Joest/Ludwig car suffered from <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> failure following the extended pace car laps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>bearing</b> seals are {{installed}} {{to ensure that}} critical engine bearings are continuously lubricated, and to prevent engine oil from leaking into the compressed air stream. If a bearing seal fails and begins to leak, depending on {{the location of the}} seal, some amount of engine oil may be released into the compressed air stream. Oil leaks may be detected by an odour akin to hot frying-pan fume, or, in more serious cases, by smoke in the cabin. This is known in the industry as a fume event.|$|E
5000|$|The BV 238 V1, {{bearing the}} four-letter Stammkennzeichen factory radio code of RO + EZ, first flew in April 1944. Six 1,287 kW (1,750 hp) Daimler-Benz DB 603 {{inverted}} V12 piston engines {{were used in}} total, arranged in three forward-facing engine nacelles on each wing. Each engine's coolant radiator {{was placed in a}} chin cowl directly under the <b>engine,</b> <b>bearing</b> an [...] to those fitted to the Do 217M medium bomber and some examples of the Do 217J night fighter, possibly as standardized Kraftei ("power-egg") unitized engine modules.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leading cause}} of low oil {{pressure}} in an engine is wear on the engine’s vital parts. Over time, <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> and seals suffer from wear and tear. Wear can cause these parts to eventually lose their original dimensions, and this increased clearance allows for a greater volume of oil to flow over time which can greatly reduce oil pressure. For instance, [...]001 of an inch worn off of the <b>engine’s</b> main <b>bearings</b> can cause up to a 20% loss in oil pressure. [...] Simply replacing worn bearings may fix this problem, but in older engines {{with a lot of}} wear not much can be done besides completely overhauling the engine.|$|R
30|$|Cheng and Pecht [48] {{presented}} {{a case study}} for RUL estimation using fusion approach for ceramic capacitors. Another application based on this approach is the prognostics of lithium ion battery [49]. Goebel et al. [50] used a fusion approach for aircraft <b>engines</b> <b>bearing,</b> and {{the results show that}} this method gives more accurate and robust outcome than using either data driven or PoF alone.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{silicate}} {{solution is}} used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the <b>engine's</b> <b>bearings</b> and pistons within a few minutes. In the United States, this procedure was used to comply with requirements of the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) program.|$|R
5000|$|It was a four bay biplane, with fabric covered, {{constant}} chord, unswept wings with angled tips. The upper wing, which {{carried the}} ailerons, had a 7% greater span {{and a smaller}} chord. There was no stagger, so the sets of parallel interplane struts were vertical; flying wires braced each bay. Pairs of V-form <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> struts which supported the two rotary engines above the lower wing defined the inner two bays. It {{was designed to be}} powered either by a pair of [...] Le Rhône 9Jb or [...] Clerget 9B nine-cylinder rotary engines. Ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing.|$|E
50|$|Although Cooper never raced in the Vanderbilt Cup, he {{did work}} with the American Matheson team in 1905 and 1906, and was entered in the 1905 American Elimination Trials on September 22, 1905. In {{the final day of}} {{practice}} for the 1905 American Elimination Trial, Cooper's Matheson had a faulty lubricating system, destroying the main <b>engine</b> <b>bearing.</b> In 1906, Cooper returned with Matheson not as a driver, but as team manager. The driver was the Italian Ralph Mongini. Mongini led a few miles of the first lap around the 29.71 mile course before losing control of his machine and crashing into a telegraph pole. The 1906 race was held September 23.|$|E
50|$|The 1964 Lady Wigram Trophy was a motor race {{held at the}} Wigram Airfield Circuit on 18 January 1964. It was {{the thirteenth}} Lady Wigram Trophy to be held and was won by Bruce McLaren {{for the second year}} in {{succession}} in the Cooper T70. After having started eighth after a dismal performance in the preliminary heat, McLaren came through the pack to take the win in what he described as his greatest performance. Jack Brabham took second place after a strong performance throughout the weekend whilst Denny Hulme came home third after losing second on the final lap due to <b>engine</b> <b>bearing</b> issues.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce costs, used {{crankshafts}} may also be machined. A good core may often be easily reconditioned by a crankshaft grinding [...] process. Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a welding operation, prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, undersize <b>engine</b> <b>bearings</b> are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.|$|R
