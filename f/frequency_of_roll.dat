40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{attitude}} error of vehicles has an intense trend of divergence when vehicles undergo worsening coning environment, in this paper, the model of dynamic coning environment is derived firstly. Then, through investigation of the effect on Euler attitude algorithm for the equivalency of traditional attitude algorithm, it is found that attitude error is actually the roll angle error including drifting error and oscillating error, which is induced directly by dynamic coning environment and further affects the pitch angle and yaw angle through transferring. Based on definition of the cone frame and cone attitude, a cone algorithm is proposed by rotation relationship to calculate cone attitude, and the relationship between cone attitude and Euler attitude of spinning vehicle is established. Through numerical simulations with different conditions of dynamic coning environment, it is shown that the induced error of Euler attitude fluctuates by the variation of precession and nutation, especially by that of nutation, and the oscillating <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> angle error is twice that of pitch angle error and yaw angle error. In addition, the rotation angle is more competent to describe the spinning process of vehicles under coning environment than Euler angle gamma, and the real pitch angle and yaw angle are calculated finally...|$|E
40|$|Background: in many environments {{associated}} with motion sickness there are low frequency motions in several axes, including roll. Roll motion {{has often been}} {{assumed to be a}} cause of motion sickness, either alone or in combination with motions in other axes. However, there have been no systematic studies of the effects of roll frequency on sickness. Hypothesis: it was hypothesized that sickness caused by roll oscillation would depend on the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll.</b> Method: there were 100 male subjects (aged 18 to 26 yr) who participated in a laboratory study. Prior to experiencing motion, all subjects completed a motion sickness history questionnaire giving information on travel and motion sickness experience. The seated subjects were exposed within a closed cabin to 30 min of sinusoidal roll motion at one of five frequencies: 0. 025 Hz, 0. 05 Hz, 0. 10 Hz, 0. 20 Hz, or 0. 40 Hz. At each frequency, the cabin oscillated through ± 8 ° about a center of rotation located on the seat surface. Ratings of motion sickness were obtained at 1 -min intervals. Results: subject illness ratings were positively correlated with their previous motion sickness, although at each frequency the amount of sickness was small. Overall, {{there was no significant difference}} in the sickness ratings produced by the five motions. Conclusions: the frequency dependence of motion sickness produced by roll oscillation differs from that {{associated with}} vertical and horizontal oscillation. Motion sickness associated with pure roll oscillation of a seat will usually be less than the sickness associated with pure translational oscillation of the seat or the sickness associated with combined translation and rotation...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{simulations}} of a compressible fluid, convecting heat in two dimensions, suggest that, within {{a range of}} Rayleigh numbers, two distinctly different, but stable, time-dependent flow morphologies are possible. The simpler of the flows has two characteristic frequencies: the rotation <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the convecting <b>rolls,</b> and the vertical oscillation <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolls.</b> Observables, such as the heat flux, have a simple-periodic (harmonic) time dependence. The more complex flow {{has at least one}} additional characteristic frequency [...] the horizontal <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the cold, downward- and the warm, upward-flowing plumes. Observables of this latter flow have a broadband frequency distribution. The two flow morphologies, at the same Rayleigh number, have different rates of entropy production and different Lyapunov exponents. The simpler "harmonic" flow transports more heat (produces entropy at a greater rate), whereas the more complex "chaotic" flow has a larger maximum Lyapunov exponent (corresponding to a larger rate of phase-space information loss). A linear combination of these two rates is invariant for the two flow morphologies over the entire range of Rayleigh numbers for which the flows coexist, suggesting a relation between the two rates near the onset of convective turbulence.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the flow field near the orifice of a plane wall jet is in focus. Two main flow regions may be {{distinguished}} in the wall-jet, i. e. a free shear layer {{away from the wall}} and a boundary layer close to the surface.

The structures, which occur naturally, have different spanwise scales and emerge at different distance from the nozzle. Effects of the flow velocity, upstream perturbations and acoustic excitation on the generation and characteristics of the streamwise disturbances are investigated and especially the interaction between the two layers is studied. In order to resolve the complex 3 D flow by means of hot-wires a system for accurate automated traversing and data acquisition has been developed.

40|$|Extreme <b>roll</b> motion <b>of</b> ships can {{be caused}} by several phenomena, one of which is {{parametric}} roll resonance. Several incidents occurred unexpectedly around the millennium and caused vast fiscal losses on large container vessels. The phenomenon is now well understood and some consider parametric roll a curiosity, others have concerns. This study employs novel signal-based detection algorithms to analyse logged motion data from a container vessel (2800 ~TEU) and a large car and truck carrier (LCTC) during one year at sea. The scope of the study is to assess the performance and robustness of the detection algorithms in real conditions, and to evaluate the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> parametric <b>roll</b> events on the selected vessels. Detection performance is scrutinised through the validation of the detected events using owners' standard methods, and supported by available wave radar data. Further, a bivariate statistical analysis of the outcome of the signal-based detectors is performed to assess the real life false alarm probability. It is shown that detection robustness and very low false warning rates are obtained. The study concludes that small parametric roll events are occurring, and that the proposed signal-based monitoring system is a simple and effective mean to provide timely warning of resonance conditions.

40|$|International audienceA {{unstable}} herd of 44 Arab mares {{was observed}} in a 2500 m 2 paddock in summer in Tunisia. Fifteen-minute focal animal samples and scan sampling {{were used to determine}} the time budget of the mares during the period from 9 am to 3 pm and to study their social behaviour. A total of 42 hours of observations were performed. The behavioural states recorded were feeding, drinking, alert-standing, stand-resting, self-grooming, locomoting, rolling and social interactions. Locomotion was the most frequent activity at 27. 9 ± 19. 47 % (mean ± SD), followed by feeding, and standing resting. The mares spent 14. 88 ± 18. 83 % of their time alertstanding, 1. 03 ± 3. 51 % self-grooming, 4. 75 ± 7. 19 % drinking and 0. 83 % ± 2. 64 % interacting socially. 269 agonistic interactions were noticed. Retreat and avoidance represented the most frequent agonistic interactions (65 % of total interactions). Almost 60 % of all aggression consisted of threats to bite. Threats to kick (27 %) were next in <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> occurrence. <b>Rolling</b> was observed only once and mares were never observed allogrooming, lying down, urinating, defecating nor vocalizing. Social behaviour was restricted to agonistic interactions and preferential associations that could be determined were very rare. The tendency to stay away from other mares (percentage of time spent at more than 3 horse's body length) differed largely between mares and was unexpectedly high given the high density of animals (8. 28 ± 15. 37 %). The data obtained in this high density situation therefore reveals restricted behavioural repertoires, unusual time budgets with a high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> active walk that constitutes the most frequent activity, and a low level of social interactions that were almost entirely restricted to agonistic interactions. These results are discussed in relation to other similar studies on domestic horses and questions of welfare assessment...|$|R
40|$|Insects and {{penguins}} flap their pectoral fins {{to produce}} forces. Flapping means simultaneous rolling and pitching oscillations {{with or without}} twist. Twisting is a differential pitching between the root and {{the tip of the}} fin, added to the normal pitching oscillation. The rolling and pitching oscillations are 90 deg apart. Flapping fins produce leading edge vortices which enhance lift forces and delay stall even at high angles of attack, and the mechanism is known as dynamic stall (ASME JFE v 131 031801 - 29 2009 [...] .

The system is chaotic at the onset itself with three coexisting chaotic attractors that are born at two codimension- 2 bifurcation points.

Primary frequency ratio was fixed at 1. 10 and primary levels were equal (65 dB SPL). Levels of the 2 f 1 − f 2 DPOAE remained near 30 dB SPL for frequencies above 500 Hz. Below 500 Hz, the 2 f 1 − f 2 level rolled off. An interspecies difference was observed in the − 3 dB corner <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roll</b> off. A lower 2 f 1 − f 2 corner frequency was observed in D. spectabilis, consistent with predicted amplitude differences based on species size. The decline in 2 f 1 − f 2 level below 500 Hz was in agreement with published threshold data for D. merriami. A comparison of DPOAE orders, including 2 f 1 − f 2, 3 f 1 − 2 f 2, 2 f 2 − f 1, {{was used to evaluate}} the origin of the decline in level. The high pass filter shape of the level functions was observed across animals, species, DPOAE orders and primary ratios. All orders were observed to roll off in a range between 300 and 500 Hz. Differential filtering of DPOAE orders apical and basal to the primaries was observed in both species suggesting that the roll off was cochlear in origin. The decline in DPOAE level below 500 Hz is consistent with reports from other researchers that the apex of the cochlea shows decreased nonlinearity and that helicotrema effects dominate at very low frequencies. While ecological studies in kangaroo rats have implicated differences in hearing as having a causal relationship to interspecies differences in communication ability and anti-predator behavior, these are the first data to demonstrate a difference in auditory capacity at low frequencies. ...|$|R

An analytical model <b>of</b> ship <b>roll</b> motion interacting with ice is developed based on Zhuravlev and Ivanov non-smooth coordinate transformations. These transformations {{have the advantage}} of converting the vibro-impact oscillator into an oscillator without barriers such that the corresponding equation of motion does not contain any impact term. Such approaches, however, account for the energy loss at impact times in different ways. The present work, in particular, brings to the attention the fact that the impact dynamics may have qualitatively different response characteristics to different dissipation models. The difference between localized and distributed equivalent damping approaches is discussed. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out for all initial conditions covered by the ship grazing orbit for different values of excitation amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> external wave <b>roll</b> moment.

An experimental investigation conducted on a small ship model. In particular, the experimental tests reveal complex dynamic response on multi-frequency wave motion caused by the wave reflection from the tank walls. Measured results showed a good agreement with the predicted results for small angles of the barrier relative to the ship unbiased position. However, deviation becomes significant as the angle increases. This deviation is mainly attributed to the uncertainty of the coefficient of restitution, which is found to depend on the velocity of impact in addition to the geometry and material properties of the model and barrier...|$|R

Analysis <b>of</b> failed <b>roll</b> materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The hot strip mill referred here consists of six stands wherein high chromium (Hi-Cr) iron rolls and Indefinite Chilled Double Poured (ICDP) cast iron rolls are being used for finishing rolling of the strips in the last two stands. The thin strip mill produces strips in the thickness range of 1. 0 – 12. 7 mm.

40|$|Roll-ratchet {{refers to}} a high {{frequency}} oscillation which can occur in pilot-in-the-loop control <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> attitude in high performance aircraft. The <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> oscillation are typically well beyond those associated with the more familiar pilot-induced oscillation. A structural model of the human pilot which has been employed to provide a unified theory for aircraft handling qualities and pilot-induced oscillations is employed here to provide a theory {{for the existence of}} roll-ratchet. It is hypothesized and demonstrated using the structural model that the pilot's inappropriate use of vestibular acceleration feedback can cause this phenomenon, a possibility which has been discussed previously by other researchers. The possible influence of biodynamic feedback on roll ratchet is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|On {{uncorrelated}} Vibroseis shot gathers, each <b>frequency</b> component <b>of</b> ground <b>roll</b> {{is represented}} {{with a unique}} slope {{as a function of}} arrival time and sweep function with excellent isolation from other components. The calculation of phase velocity becomes a simple matter of measuring the slope <b>of</b> each different <b>frequency</b> using an appropriate coherency measure. Possible contamination by coherent noise can readily be determined for each frequency by visual inspection. Any change in field configuration or extra efforts during data processing steps can be immediately designated. The multi-channel measurement method allows averaging and therefore effective reduction in any random noise introduced during recording. Therefore, the dispersion curve is constructed in a fast, accurate, and fully automated manner. Qualitative information about near-surface conditions can also be inferred from visual inspection, making it possible to detect near-surface anomalies. Multi-channel analysis of surface waves using Vibroseis (MASWV) has advantages over the Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method which employs only two receivers with an impact source. First of all, because of the high spectral integrity of acquired data, a high degree of accuracy can be placed on the results of the method. Furthermore, the method is much faster and less labor-intensive than SASW since only a single or a few recorded shot gathers are usually necessary to produce a well behaved dispersion curve...|$|R
