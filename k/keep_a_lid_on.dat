Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the back of his mind was trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Music journalist Sam Richards {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a twinkling '90s alt. rock ballad- {{a cousin of}} Radiohead's [...] "High and Dry" [...] and Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "1979"- that just about manages to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> its impulse {{to seek out the}} nearest clifftop." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said [...] "the performance is full of languorous beauty, a gentle understated kind of emotion that seems at odds with the disorientation in the lyrics." [...] Billboard contributor Fred Bronson joked that it was an example of how songs named [...] "Stay" [...] reach the Hot 100, following similarly named hits by Big Mountain, The Four Seasons, Shakespears Sister, and Jodeci. Robert Levine of Spin called it one of their best songs, saying [...] "They're still obsessed with transcendence, whether it's the kind you find on a Joshua Tree bluff or a [...] "Miami" [...] dance floor. And [...] framed that search in the most intimate of terms, even when they were too jaded to crawl out from under their lemon and look us in the eye." ...|$|E

Aletrino and Johanna van Maarseveen, de Haan's fiancée, bought almost the entire print run of the book, to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> the scandal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{critical}} reception {{was mixed}} despite the awards {{won by the}} film. The New York Times was unimpressed by Alicia Rodríguez' lead performance and the [...] "insistently blanched" [...] cinematography.

[...] Todd McCarthy for The Hollywood Reporter said about the film that [...] "the ferocious effort of conservative religions to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> tight <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> pre-marital sex {{is as old as}} history, but seeing it played out in a South American context gives it a new twist, at least onscreen." ...|$|R
