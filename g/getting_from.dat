25|$|A {{number of}} animals have evolved aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) have evolved {{separately}} many times, without any single ancestor. Flight has evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid canopy animals in <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among rainforest animals, especially in the rainforests in Asia (most especially Borneo) where the trees are tall and widely spaced. Several species of aquatic animals, and a few amphibians have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically {{as a means of}} evading predators.|$|E
25|$|The win granted him a {{challenge}} title match in September 1995 against the King of Pancrase Minoru Suzuki, which was their rematch from the fight {{at the beginning}} of their careers. The match was long and intense, as Suzuki rode Rutten for most of their exchanges in the bout, and actually managed to force him to spend a rope escape with a tight kneebar. Rutten held his own through his defensive acumen, occasionally countering with guillotine chokes and a surprising rolling kneebar from standing, until the match came to its last minutes. After <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> under a mount, Rutten threw a front kick to the body which downed Suzuki and followed with a guillotine choke, making the King of Pancrase tap out.|$|E

25|$|Gaye {{acted in}} two movies, both {{having to do}} with Vietnam veterans. One was in 1969 in the George McCowan-directed film, The Ballad of Andy Crocker which starred Lee Majors. The film was about a war veteran {{returning}} to find that his expectations have not been met and he feels betrayed. Gaye had a prominent role in the film as David Owens. The other was in 1971. He had a role in the Lee Frost-directed biker-exploitation film, Chrome and Hot Leather, a film about a group of Vietnam veterans taking on a bike gang. The film starred William Smith and Gaye played the part of Jim, one of the veterans. Gaye did have acting aspirations and had signed with the William Morris Agency but that only lasted a year as Gaye wasn't satisfied with the support he was <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> the agency.|$|E
25|$|Until 2001 the Italian state offered {{citizens}} {{living abroad}} a free return train journey {{to their home}} town in Italy in order to vote, however {{the portion of the}} train journey that was free of charge was only on Italian soil. Any costs incurred in <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote, therefore a free return train journey was hardly an incentive for the large Italian communities living as far away as in the United States, Argentina or Australia. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns that bordered to Italy such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of political representation especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the {{scientists}} tested her on, and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability {{to piece together}} objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on spatial awareness tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded. Similarly, on a Mooney Face Test in May 1975 she had {{the highest score in}} medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the 95th percentile for adults. On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better than other people in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for stereognosis at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age. The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to be able to recognize the location she was in and was good at <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.|$|E

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{also learned}} much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he {{initially}} considered this knowledge a curse, it {{would prove to}} be a boon to his later activities in Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool en masse at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but soon realized that they were determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the Ohio Cultivator, Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools en masse at the cheap prices they had been <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> them. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.|$|E

Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just as you start to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment".

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|By early 1961 a rift {{developed}} and deepened between Guard {{on one side}} and Shane and Reynolds on the other. Guard had been referred to in the press and on the albums' liner notes as the [...] "acknowledged leader" [...] of the group, a description never wholly endorsed by Shane and Reynolds, who felt themselves equal contributors to the group's repertoire and success. Guard wanted Shane and Reynolds to follow his lead and learn more of the technical aspects of music and to redirect the group's song selections, {{in part because of the}} withering criticism that the group had been <b>getting</b> <b>from</b> more traditional folk performers for the Trio's smoother and more commercial versions of folk songs and for the money-making copyrights that the Kingston group had secured for their arrangements of public domain songs.
