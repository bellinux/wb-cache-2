Although Robertson only achieved the feat for a full season once, his cumulative stats over his first 5 seasons <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> average of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. Westbrook finished the 2016–17 season averaging 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 10.4 assists.|$|E

He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, but felt that it <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E

He pitched 98innings and yielded only 22 earned runs, which <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> ERA of 2.02 during the approximately 50-day span.

5|$|Hotze's {{experience}} with military preparedness and organization <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> advantage {{in establishing the}} lancers as a new combat arm. Recognizing the importance of lancers {{as part of the}} Austrian armed force, he embarked on an organizational and training program. The Emperor named him as commander of these corps, with the rank of a full colonel. In 1787, he returned temporarily to Russia, this time to establish a similar force in Catherine the Great's army. At the outbreak of the border war between the Ottoman Empire and Austria, he returned to Austria and took command of his regiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|Mieza {{was like}} a {{boarding}} school for Alexander {{and the children of}} Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The hero's inseparable {{companion}} was his powerful, talking {{piebald horse}} Šarac; Marko always <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> equal share of his wine. The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko {{to capture the}} dangerous, elusive vila Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> {{invitation}} to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the instruments, the term taiko also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called kumi-daiko, or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). Kumi-daiko was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in kumi-daiko performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Boise {{served on the}} board of {{trustees}} at Willamette University in Salem and Pacific University in Forest Grove. Pacific <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> honorary doctor of laws degree.

He also spent five terms as the master of the state grange association, and owned the Ellendale Woolen Mill. A public speaker, he gave speeches for the Oregon Historical Society, the Oregon Pioneer Society, and the Oregon State Bar {{as well as at the}} dedication of a monument to missionary Jason Lee.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> entire army.|$|E
