40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{mechanisms}} responsible for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from fractured carbonate reservoirs by surfactant solutions, and methods to screen for effective chemical formulations quickly. One key to this EOR process is the surfactant solution reversing the wettability of the carbonate surfaces from less water-wet to more water-wet conditions. This effect allows the aqueous phase to imbibe into the matrix spontaneously and expel oil bypassed by a waterflood. This study used different naphthenic acids (NA) dissolved in decane as a model oil to render calcite surfaces less water-wet. Because pure compounds are used, trends in wetting behavior {{can be related to}} NA molecular structure as measured by solid adsorption; contact angle; and a novel, simple <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> with calcite powder. Experiments with different surfactants and NA-treated calcite powder provide information about mechanisms responsible for sought-after reversal to a more water-wet state.

40|$|In this study, a {{collector}} combination between xanthate and a fatty acid collector (Betacol 364) is tested on an ore containing chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite. An {{increase in the}} rate of pentlandite and pyrrhotite recovery was measured when the fatty acid and xanthate combination was tested against the baseline (xanthate as sole collector), using the standard laboratory scale batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> procedure. The rate of mineral recovery in a batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> is not only influenced by particle floatability, but also by the amount of air bubble surface area available in the pulp and the recovery of value mineral from the flotation froth. This is given as =.. where k is the rate constant (min- 1), P is a parameter which represents the floatability of a mineral, Rf is the froth recovery factor and Sb bubble surface area flux. A test unit developed for this study (based on the Bikerman foam test) indicated that the fatty acid collector used (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising characteristics and thus may have increased the froth recovery (Rf) during the batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test.</b> The increase {{in the rate of}} pyrrhotite recovery measured can therefore not only be explained by an increase in pyrrhotite floatability. In a case where the batch flotation tests are followed by plant testing and the rate of flotation increase measured during the batch test was only or partially {{as a result of an}} increase in froth recovery (Rf), the batch test would be an unreliable test to predict plant performance. Plant operators have many variables available to manage froth recovery (Rf), for example pulp level and frother dosing rate. For a laboratory scale batch test to be a reliable test for predicting a rate increase in plant recovery, it is necessary that an increase in the rate of recovery will be as a result of an increase in particle floatability (P). It is recommended that {{a collector}} batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> campaign must include a test to measure if the collector has frothing characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column is demonstrated as a possible test to measure if a collector has froth stabilising characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column test method confirmed that the fatty acid collector tested (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising properties. Additional tests are therefore recommended to confirm that the rate of recovery increase measured is as a result of an increase in pyrrhotite and pentlandite floatability (P). Micro flotation tests performed on pyrrhotite mineral specimens confirmed that a combination between Xanthate and Betacol 364 increases the particle floatability (P) of pyrrhotite. Laboratory scale flotation tests performed on artificial ores, consisting of a mixture of quartz and pyrrhotite mineral specimens, confirmed that the combination of Betacol 364 and xanthate increases the floatability of pyrrhotite (P).

40|$|Ore floatability {{is defined}} as the {{propensity}} of particles to float within a flotation environment and any effective mathematical model of the flotation process must incorporate its effect. The objective of this thesis was to review the ore floatability models in the literature and for those considered appropriate: • investigate their basic assumptions, • evaluate the type of experimental data required to derive model parameters, • and test their predictive capability. A review of the literature identified three different methods of representing ore floatability in flotation circuit models. Two approaches were studied within this thesis, namely the empirically derived floatability component model and the property based floatability component model. The third shaped distribution modelling approach was considered too inflexible a methodology to represent all types of ore floatability distributions. Ore floatability cannot be directly measured but must be inferred from a flotation response. In this thesis, it was investigated using batch laboratory flotation tests which, for a particular system, were all performed using the same set of operating conditions. Any difference in response between tests performed in this way was attributed to a change in ore floatability. Within this thesis, hundreds of batch laboratory flotation tests were performed using samples collected from the streams of seven different industrial flotation circuits. These tests, in combination with circuit survey data, were used to investigate various assumptions underpinning the ore floatability models. The tests also provide the experimental information required to derive the flotation properties of the two chosen ore floatability models. Both the two models investigated in this thesis assume the floatability of a particle in a flotation circuit to remain the same before and after processes in the circuit. A nodal analysis technique was developed by the author to compare the floatability in the feed and product of a flotation circuit process using batch laboratory <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> information. This technique was used to show that ore floatability is a conserved property across most flotation, mixing and cycloning processes. In the cases where floatability was not conserved, it is suspected that the surfaces of the particles have changed due to oxidation, adsorption of hydrophilic species or decomposition of reagent surface species. Ore floatability was usually not conserved across processes which are designed to change particle properties (e. g. reagent addition and regrinding). An additional requirement of the ore floatability models is that all particles assigned to a particular component must float with a similar flotation rate. Sizing and liberation analysis of batch laboratory <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> data showed that property based floatability component models based on size and liberation alone do not satisfy this criteria. It was concluded that a property based model would need to include information about the chemical state of the particle surfaces. As this type of measurement was considered {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis, no further analysis of this type of model was possible. Techniques for determining the empirically derived floatability component model parameters were studied using statistical techniques. This analysis showed that unique, stable parameters could be obtained by fitting the models to match multiple batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> data collected at the same time as a circuit survey. It was found that a minimum of four batch laboratory flotation tests were required to derive statistically stable parameters. The use of one laboratory batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> (the traditional method of parameter derivation) results in parameters which are highly sensitive to the error in the batch laboratory <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> data. A methodology to simulate and predict ore grade and recovery in a flotation circuit based on different ore floatability particle groupings was developed by the author. A theoretical analysis was performed using this algorithm which showed that a two floating component and one non-floating component model produced similar predictions to a multi-component model developed using size and liberation information in a circuit subject to changes in cell operation, residence time and circuit configuration. It was therefore concluded that a discrete floatability component model has the ability to represent, what is in reality, a more complex particle floatability distribution. The analysis performed in this thesis shows that the empirically derived ore floatability component model is a valid method of representing ore floatability within a flotation circuit model which does not contain grinding or reagent addition processes. Parameters of the model can be derived with statistical confidence using multiple batch <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> data. To effectively model ore floatability in circuits containing regrinding or staged reagent addition, ore floatability models need to be developed which incorporate parameters related to the physical properties of the ore. It is therefore recommended that research be performed to determine the effect of size, liberation and chemical conditioning on the ore floatability of a particle and how these effects are best incorporated into an ore floatability model...|$|E

When mixed minerals were conditioned under the natural atmosphere, a faster conditioning speed and longer conditioning time decreased the flotation recovery of pyrrhotite. However, when mixed minerals were conditioned under a nitrogen atmosphere, a more intensive conditioning process provided better flotation results. XPS analyses illustrate that a faster conditioning speed and longer conditioning time under the natural atmosphere accelerates the oxidation of pyrrhotite, leading to a decrease in the flotation recovery of pyrrhotite...|$|R

The complex nature of the platinum-group element (PGE) deportment in this ore renders the normally-practiced procedures inappropriate for this particular testwork. A more robust and thorough procedure is necessary because of the diverse mineralogical forms in which the PGE are found. The evaluation of the mass and value balances has accordingly to take these factors into account. The major features of the evaluation of input and output errors across the laboratory scale <b>flotation</b> <b>test</b> are analysed. It is found that unless size-by-size variance of PGE in a conventionally crushed mill feed is taken into account the mill feed sample size is underestimated by some 176 %. Further the preparation of a reference distribution of assayed head material is necessary to provide the 95 % confidence limits of grade estimate. The need for repeating flotation tests and compositing the adjudicated products is discussed, concluding that quintuplicates are suitable to achieve a desirable level {{of confidence in the}} built-up head grade.

40|$|The <b>flotation</b> <b>testing</b> of {{sulphide}} ores for flowsheet development, or for {{the improvement}} of existing flowsheets in operations, has been practiced for a century or so. This practice has evolved at both laboratory and operations scales, as a result of contributions by various workers in this field. In this review, two major contributions to improved practice are discussed, viz Process Mineralogy and representative sampling. A description of modern best practice is proposed, particularly in the context of circuit changes or reagent selection and the use of mixed collectors. Process Mineralogy has contributed significantly by way of powerful information that reveals process implications such as those resulting from grinding strategies or flotation selectivity challenges. Only recently has the best practice of sampling been connected to <b>flotation</b> <b>testing.</b> High Confidence <b>Flotation</b> <b>Testing,</b> which incorporates appropriate sampling models, was proposed in 1995, and used Gy’s minimum sample mass and Safety Line models. Statistical Benchmark Surveying, a method for extracting representative suites of survey samples from an operating plant, was added in 2005. A new addition is the small scale evaluation of floatability using the JKMSI, which enables the testing of small samples such as of drill core, and is demonstrating good agreement with operations data. Two generations of improved practice are reviewed. The first is when this practice was retrofitted to serve existing concentrators that had been conventionally designed, in a reactive approach. The second is serving new design opportunities before commissioning, where predictive value is added to the project with a more complete understanding of the process implications drawn from the sampling and characterisation of drill core. It is shown that when these connections are made and modern quality controls are applied to the <b>flotation</b> <b>testing,</b> much clearer conclusions are drawn, and tighter metal balances achieved, with better metallurgical performance.

The apatite grade in concentrate is 66. 61 % at the recovery of 78. 35 % by simulation, while apatite grade in concentrate is 72. 70 % at the recovery of 88. 14 % in the laboratory tests. Compared with experiment data, the accuracy of simulation is acceptable...|$|R
