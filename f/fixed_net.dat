40|$|Introduction Today's {{wireless}} technologies have some characteristics that are anachronistic {{in the context}} of current fixed networks. Unpredictable quality of service fluctuations and high cost are the challenges of a mobile computing environment that an application has to cope with (cf. [BCK + 95]). Generally, a client-server-style application designed for untethered devices can choose between three interaction paradigms to address these shortcomings: replication of data, remote operation execution, and delegation of functionality to the <b>fixed</b> <b>net</b> (cf. [CGH + 95]). In this position paper we propose a model whose aim is to reduce the usage cost of wireless links by adaptively employing these techniques. 2 The Stublet Approach Any application normally comprises components dedicated to local and remote purposes.

40|$|Human {{society is}} now at the {{beginning}} of a transition from fossil-fuel based primary energy sources to a mixture of renewable and nuclear based energy sources which have a lower Energy Return On Energy Invested (EROEI) than the older fossil based sources. This paper examines the evolution of total energy demand during this transition for a highly idealized energy economy. A simple model is introduced in which the net useful energy output required to operate an economy is assumed to remain fixed while the lower EROEI source gradually replaces the older higher EROEI primary energy source following a logistics substitution model. The results show that, for <b>fixed</b> <b>net</b> useful energy output, total energy demand increases as the ratio EROEI new /EROEI old decreases; total energy demand diverges as EROEI new approaches unity, indicating that the system must collapse in this limit.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{complexity}} issues associated with gate duplication for delay optimization. Gate duplication for general circuits has been proved NP-Complete [1]. In this paper we show that even the local delay optimization by gate duplication is NPComplete. Local fanout optimization (buffer insertion) for <b>fixed</b> <b>net</b> topology can be solved in polynomial time [9]. Even the global fanout optimization problem has polynomial time complexity if all the pin to pin parameters of a gate are the same and the topology of all the nets is fixed [13].
