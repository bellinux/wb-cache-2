5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and <b>helmet</b> <b>covers</b> from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, {{with the addition of}} a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932. In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and <b>helmet</b> <b>covers</b> printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{patterns}} were briefly used together {{during the transition}} period, most notably during Operation Restore Hope and Operation Gothic Serpent (some U.S. Army Rangers during the latter occasionally wore the newer three-color DCU's along with kevlar <b>helmet</b> <b>covers</b> retaining the old six-color pattern. The same dress was also worn by soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in 2001). [...] During Operation Bright Star 1995, Third Army personnel wore the three-color uniform while troops from Fort Bragg (330th MCC) wore the six-color uniform for the 75-day exercise. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. military used the DCU's tri-color pattern and the MARPAT camouflage pattern.|$|E

2500|$|The Marine utility {{cover is}} an 8-pointed creased and peaked cover, the Army uses a rounded kepi-style patrol cap. Unlike the Army, Marines do not wear rank {{insignia}} on the cover, instead {{there is an}} Eagle, Globe, and Anchor {{in the middle of}} the cap. [...] The Army used to wear beret in garrison but has since changed the policy back to wearing the patrol cap in garrison and in field (Airborne, Special Forces, and Rangers may wear their distinctive berets in garrison). [...] The cloth <b>helmet</b> <b>covers</b> used to be required to have iron-on EGAs, but this has fallen into disuse. [...] Marines may also wear the creased garrison cover or a barracks cover with their service uniforms, while the Army wears berets and service cap with theirs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Helmet</b> <b>covers</b> {{are usually}} {{made out of}} canvas or cotton and come in many {{camouflage}} designs, for example: woodland, desert or urban, and different camouflage patterns like MARPAT, CADPAT and ACUPAT. It {{can also be used}} for UN peacekeeping missions with a UN Blue colour helmet cover. <b>Helmet</b> <b>covers</b> are generally a flat colour to stop any reflection from a metal helmet. <b>Helmet</b> <b>covers</b> are attached to the helmet in many different ways, such as a tight rubber lip which goes {{all the way around the}} helmet rim and is pulled on and peeled off, also there are versions with draw-strings and types which are attached to the helmet suspension system.

The Israeli Defense Forces use a large, floppy helmet cover {{to break up the}} outline of the soldier. The US Army from the late 1950s to the mid-late 1980s used a dual-sided camouflage cover (one side a leafy green, the other a blobby orange) with its steel helmets {{while the rest of the}} uniform was green.|$|E
