40|$|Farm <b>equipment</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{has been}} the focus of {{research}} in economics and engineering for more than 60 years. Using data from 16 years of auction sales, depreciation functions were estimated for 17 types of equipment, including tractors, combines, swathers, planters, discs, and trucks. The Box—Cox function did the best job of explaining variability in these various sales data bases and in forecasting prices in an out-of-sample data set. Nevertheless, the much less complicated double square root and sum-of-year's digits functions performed nearly as well. Simplified double square root estimates are provided for practitioners interested in forecasting <b>equipment</b> <b>depreciation.</b> Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, {{many economists}} {{undertook}} comparative studies {{of economic growth}} following World War II reconstruction.

Although {{there was always a}} concern about diminishing returns to this approach because of <b>equipment</b> <b>depreciation,</b> it was a widespread view of the correct industrial policy to adopt. Many economists pointed to the Soviet command economy as a model of high-growth through tireless re-investment of output in further industrial construction.|$|R

5000|$|Almost all {{avionics}} now incorporate BIST. In avionics, {{the purpose}} is to isolate failing line-replaceable units, which are then removed and repaired elsewhere, usually in depots or at the manufacturer. Commercial aircraft only make money when they fly, so they use BIST to minimize the time on the ground needed for repair and to increase the level of safety of the system which contains BIST. Similar arguments apply to military aircraft. When BIST is used in flight, a fault causes the system to switch to an alternative mode or equipment that still operates. Critical <b>flight</b> <b>equipment</b> is normally duplicated, or redundant.
