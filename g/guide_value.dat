Therefore {{this study was conducted}} in order to investigate cadmium and Lead concentrations in seed rice (Oryza saliva) of paddy fields in southwest of Iran. A total of 70 rice seed samples were collected from paddy fields in five regions of Khuzestan province, Southwest Iran, during harvesting time. In the samples cadmium and Lead concentrations were measured. To assess the daily intake of Cadmium and Lead by rice, daily consumption of rice was calculated. The results showed that average concentrations of Cadmium and Lead in rice seeds were 273. 6 and 121. 8 [*]μg/kg, respectively. Less than 72 % of rice seed samples had Cadmium concentrations above 200 [*]μg/kg (i. e. <b>Guide</b> <b>value</b> for cadmium); and less than 3 % had Lead concentrations above 150 [*]μg/kg (i. e. <b>Guide</b> <b>value</b> for Lead). The estimated daily intakes of cadmium by the local population was calculated to 0. 59 [*]μg/day[*]kg bw, which corresponds to 59 % of the tolerable daily intakes (i. e. 1 [*]μg/day[*]kg bw). Eleven out of 70 samples (15. 71 %) exceed the tolerable daily intakes. The dietary intakes for Lead in the local population ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 47 [*]μg/day[*]kg bw. Tolerable daily intakes for Lead is 3. 6 [*]μg/day[*]kg bw. As a whole, long term consumption of the local rice may bear high risk of heavy metal exposure to the consumer in the study region...|$|E

40|$|We {{present and}} compare results {{obtained}} from the analy­sis of poly­chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) of {{a limited number of}} contaminated soil samples collected in three areas of Basilicata region (south of Italy). The levels of PCBs were evaluated by using two analytical methods: (i) parallel dual-column gas-chromatography with dual electron capture detectors (GC–ECD) and (ii) gas-chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC–HRMS) via electron impact ionization (EI) in the multiple ion monitoring mode (MIM, two ions per compound). Two extraction methods prior to sample cleanup were also examined: microwave- assisted extraction (MAE) and ultrasonic- assisted extraction (UAE). The MAE was the extraction procedure adopted using acetone/ n-hexane (1 : 1, v/v) as it is mainly characterized by higher sample throughput and allowed reduced consumption of organic solvents. While extraction and analy­sis of spiked soil samples showed the applicability of both methods, systematic differences between the results were obtained for the sum of PCBs as a result of some non-detected congeners by GC–ECD compared with GC–HRMS. Indeed, high resolution MS using EI mode (electron energy 40 eV) with a resolving power of 10, 000 provides additional information about the contamination pattern. The GC–ECD screening of 11 soil samples led to just one sample non-compliant to as it was close to the <b>guide</b> <b>value</b> for soils fixed by the Italian legislation (i. e., 60 ppb for private or urban soil). Using GC–HRMS, the amount of all PCBs found ranged from 5. 4 to 127 ppb with five soil samples non-compliant to the <b>guide</b> <b>value.</b> The number of identified congeners ranged from 1 to 9 and 9 to 18 using dual-column GC–ECD and GC–HRMS, respectively...|$|E

Viewing hierarchical modeling as the “gold standard ” for combining information across studies, we provide a formal justification of the power prior by examining formal analytical relationships between the power prior and hierarchical modeling in linear models. Asymptotic relationships between the power prior and hierarchical modeling are obtained for non-normal models, including generalized linear models, for example. These analytical relationships unify the theory of the power prior, demonstrate the generality of the power prior, shed new light on benchmark analyses, and provide insights into the elicitation of the power parameter in the power prior. Several theorems are presented establishing these formal connections, as well as a formal methodology for eliciting a <b>guide</b> <b>value</b> for the power parameter a 0 via hierarchical models...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} report of SWOV Working Group "Tyres, road {{surfaces}} and skidding accidents". Skidding {{is considered to be}} an important contributory factor in traffic accidents. Skidding can in principle be prevented in two ways, viz: (1) reduction of the minimum necessary friction, and (2) increasing the available friction. The minimum necessary friction depends on the desired driving behavior which is affected mainly by factors associated with the road, the vehicle, other traffic and the weather. The available friction depends {{on the nature of the}} contact between the tire and the road surface. Various investigations have shown that, among other factors, the skidding resistance of the raod surface influences the likelihood of skidding and hence of an accident. However, it has not yet been possible, on the basis of these investigations, to determine a definite 'minimum necessary' value for the skidding resistance of a road surface. Nevertheless, the working group on tires, road surfaces and skidding accidents considers it very important for a fixed minimum skidding resistance for the surfaces of all roads in the netherlands to be recommended immediately, even if this value is provisional. Its conclusion is that [...] partly for the sake of uniformity [...] the <b>guide</b> <b>value</b> already employed by the state road laboratory for many years for state roads and recently also for secondary roads, should be recommended as a provisional <b>guide</b> <b>value</b> for the skidding resistance of all roads in the netherlands. This minimum skidding resistance for a wet road surface, expressed as the coefficient of friction, measured with a standardized patterned measuring tire at 86 % longitudinal slip and a road speed of 50 km/h, is 0. 51. However, the working group considers that more research is necessary before a definitive value can be recommended. It will also be necessary to seek other concrete measures which might reduce the incidence of skidding. A research program for this purpose is suggested. /Author/...|$|E
