The aerodynamics of the flow within the slot is complex and this, together with the placement of the fuel <b>holes</b> with cross <b>injection,</b> controls the mixing of the fuel and air. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the Shear Stress Transport (k-ω) turbulence model was used for flow and mixing predictions within the radial swirler slot and for conducting a CFD-based Design of Experiments (DOE) optimisation study, in which different parameters related to the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>holes</b> were varied. The optimisation study was comprised of 25 orthogonal design configurations in a Taguchi L 25 orthogonal array. The test domain for the CFD, and its experimental validation, was a large-scale representation of a swirler slot from a Siemens proprietary DLE combustion system. The DOE study showed that the number of fuel <b>holes,</b> <b>injection</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and inter-hole distance are the most influential parameters for determining optimal fuel mixing. Consequently, the optimised mixing configuration obtained from the above study was experimentally tested on an atmospheric test facility.

Photocurrent matching was achieved through adjustment of NiO and TiO2 film thicknesses to control the optical absorptions and therefore match the photocurrents of both electrodes. The energy conversion efficiency of the device is 1.91%, which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components, but is still much {{lower than that of}} high performance n-DSC devices (6%–11%). The results are still promising since the tandem DSC was in itself rudimentary.

A fully three-dimensional stress-strain solver and Poisson-drift-diffusion solver are employed to study the current path, where the quantum efficiency and turn-on voltage will be discussed.

The IQE behavior with different V-pit sizes, threading dislocation densities, and current densities were analyzed.

40|$|Rock is a {{heterogeneous}} geological material. When rock {{is subjected to}} internal hydraulic pressure and external mechanical loading, the fluid flow properties will be altered by closing, opening, or other interaction of preexisting weaknesses or by induced new fractures. Meanwhile, the pore pressure can influence the fracture behavior on both a local and global scale. A finite element model that can consider the coupled effects of seepage, damage and stress field in heterogeneous rock is described. First, two series of numerical tests in relatively homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks were performed to investigate the influence of pore pressure magnitude and gradient on initiation and propagation of tensile fractures. Second, to examine the initiation of hydraulic fractures and their subsequent propagation, a series of numerical simulations {{of the behavior of}} two <b>injection</b> <b>holes</b> inside a saturated rock mass are carried out. The rock is subjected to different initial in situ stress ratios and to an internal injection (pore) pressure at the two <b>injection</b> <b>holes.</b> Numerically, simulated results indicate that tensile fracture is strongly influenced by both pore pressure magnitude and pore pressure gradient. In addition, the heterogeneity of rock, the initial in situ stress ratio (K), the distance between two <b>injection</b> <b>holes,</b> and the difference of the pore pressure in the two <b>injection</b> <b>holes</b> all play important roles in the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures.
