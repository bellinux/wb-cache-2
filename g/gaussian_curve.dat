2500|$|The {{central limit theorem}} applies in {{particular}} to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables. [...] A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the normal distribution). [...] This means that if we build a histogram of the realisations of the sum of [...] independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curve</b> as [...] approaches infinity, this relation is known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem.

Some pigments act as bio-markers and are important for separation of phytoplankton functional types. Among many efforts that have been made to obtain information on phytoplankton pigments from bio-optical properties, <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> decomposed from phytoplankton absorption spectrum have been used to represent the light absorption of different pigments. We incorporated the Gaussian scheme into a semi-analytical model and obtained the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> from remote sensing reflectance. In this study, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to explore the potential of obtaining the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing. Results showed that the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> can be retrieved with 35 % or less mean unbiased absolute percentage differences from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -like sensors. Further, using Lake Erie as an example, the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations were obtained from the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> and used as metrics for the spatial extent of an intense cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Erie in 2014. The seasonal variations of Gaussian absorption properties in 2011 were further obtained from MERIS imagery. This study shows that it is feasible to obtain <b>Gaussian</b> <b>curves</b> from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data, and the obtained chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations from these Gaussian peak heights demonstrated potential application to monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs) and identification of phytoplankton groups from satellite ocean color remote sensing semi-analytically...|$|R
