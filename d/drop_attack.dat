40|$|OBJECTIVES—Sudden falls {{have been}} {{described}} in patients with partial epilepsy. However, no study has detailed the clinical, EEG, and evolutive features of partial epilepsies with <b>drop</b> <b>attacks.</b>  METHODS—In a consecutive series of 222 patients with partial epilepsy admitted for uncontrolled seizures over a 10 year period, 31 patients presented with epileptic <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> during evolution of their illness. Twenty two patients had frontal, five temporal, and four multifocal or undefinable lobe epilepsy; 74 % of the cases showed an EEG pattern of secondary bilateral synchrony during evolution. A statistical comparison of some clinical and EEG features between the patients with epileptic <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> and patients with partial epilepsy without <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> (control group of 191 patients) was carried out.  RESULTS—Seventy four per cent of patients had a poor prognosis and 45 % were mentally retarded; 52 % of patients with epileptic <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> continued to have epileptic falls associated with partial seizures and mental deterioration {{at the end of}} the follow up. These characteristics of patients with epileptic <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> were significantly different from the control group.  CONCLUSION—Almost all literature reports concur that the physiopathogenetic substrate of epileptic <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> is a mechanism of secondary bilateral synchrony. A localised epileptic focus may lead to a process of secondary epileptogenesis involving the whole brain, causing a progressive cerebral disturbance with worsening of the epileptic seizures and higher cerebral functions. ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "drop attack" [...] {{is used to}} {{categorize}} otherwise unexplained falls {{from a wide variety}} of causes and is considered ambiguous medical terminology; <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> are currently reported much less often than in the past, possibly as a result of better diagnostic precision.

40|$|Introduction: The {{symptomatic}} generalized epilepsy {{is usually}} {{characterized by the}} presence of tonic and atonics crisis, many times leading the patient to sudden fall. When it happens, we call these seizures <b>drop</b> <b>attacks.</b> The treatment of these seizures is usually disappointing. Objective: This study intended to evaluate the efficacy of a medicinal scheme well determined, composed by the association of three antiepileptic drugs, aiming to control a type of epileptic seizures, the sudden fall seizures or <b>drop</b> <b>attacks.</b> Methods: We evaluated a consecutive group of 32 patients with <b>drop</b> <b>attacks,</b> which attended to Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic of the Neurology Service, Hospital São Lucas da Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), in Porto Alegre. All of them passed through a drug adjustment period, where the drugs in use were reduced and taken off, as we slowly introduced the association of valproate, lamotrigine and a benzodiazepine (clobazam, clonazepam or nitrazepam). The visits were every three months, during the period of one year. Results: Twenty-eight patients (22 male) aged 5 - 44 years (mean 16. 5), were followed for 12 months. For the whole group, the median (minimum-maximum) number of <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> during the 2 months of baseline was 50 (3 - 900). After one year with the planned medication regimen, median number of epileptic falls was 2, representing a reduction of 96 % (P < 0. 001). Specifically, in the fourth trimester, 15 patients (47 %) were free of <b>drop</b> <b>attacks,</b> 7 (21 %) had a 75 % and 5 others had a 50 - 75 % reduction in the frequency of falls. Only one patient had a reduction of less than 25 %. Conclusions: We observed that the association of valproate, lamotrigine and a benzodiazepine can be effective in the control of seizures in fall in patients with generalized and multifocal epilepsy. Introdução: A epilepsia generalizada sintomática é normalmente caracterizada pela presença de crises tônicas e atônicas, muitas vezes levando o paciente a quedas súbitas. Quando isto acontece, chamamos estas crises de <b>drop</b> <b>attacks.</b> Seu tratamento é usualmente desapontador. Objetivo: Avaliar a eficácia de uma associação de três fármacos antiepilépticos no controle de <b>drop</b> <b>attacks.</b> Métodos: Foram avaliados 32 pacientes consecutivos com <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> epilépticos que freqüentavam o ambulatório de Epilepsias de Difícil Controle do Serviço de Neurologia do Hospital São Lucas da Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS). Todos passaram por um período de ajuste medicamentoso no qual as medicações em uso foram substituídas pela associação de ácido valproico, lamotrigina e um benzodiazepínico (clobazam, clonazepam ou nitrazepam). As visitas de avaliação foram a cada três meses, no período de um ano. Resultados: Vinte e oito pacientes (22 homens) com idade entre 5 - 44 anos (média 16, 5) foram seguidos por 12 meses. A mediana de <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> durante os 2 meses basais foi 50 (3 - 900). Após um ano com o tratamento proposto, a mediana foi 2, uma redução de 96 % (P < 0, 001).

40|$|Abstract — A {{network is}} a {{collection}} of two or more computer systems which connected with each other. It is type of replace of information to communicate with one another. It is an association or set up of computer devices which are involved with the communication facilities. When number of computer is connected simultaneously to exchange information they form networks and contribute to resources. Networking is used to distribute information like data communication. Sharing resources can be software type or hardware types. It is central administration system or supports these types of system [1]. The communications protocols used to organize network traffic, with the network's size, its topology and its organizational intent. A network can be wired network and wireless network. Wired network is that which used wires for communicate with each other’s and wireless network is that which communicate without the use of wires through a medium.

40|$|Objective Analyze the {{long-term}} outcome of callosotomies {{with regard to}} seizure types and frequencies and antiepileptic drug treatment. Methods This longitudinal observational study is {{based on data from}} the prospective Swedish National Epilepsy Surgery Register. Thirty-one patients had undergone callosotomy in Sweden 1995 - 2007 and had been followed for 2 and 5 or 10 years after surgery. Data on their seizure types and frequencies, associated impairments, and use of antiepileptic drugs have been analyzed. Results The median total number of seizures per patient and month was reduced from 195 before surgery to 110 twoyears after surgery and 90 at {{the long-term}} follow-up (5 or 10 years). The corresponding figures for <b>drop</b> <b>attacks</b> (tonic or atonic) were 190 before surgery, 100 2 years after surgery, and 20 at the long-term follow-up.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for intrusion detection in mobile adhoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected adhoc network, nodes usually have {{very small number of}} neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected adhoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000 x 2000 m 2) can only improve from 76. 5 % to 79. 9 % with selective <b>dropping</b> <b>attacks.</b> Thus, we propose a ferrybased intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected adhoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile adhoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data <b>dropping</b> <b>attacks</b> performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76. 5 % with selective <b>dropping</b> <b>attacks.</b> With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87 % (with a single ferry) to 93 % (with four ferries) with selective <b>dropping</b> <b>attacks.</b> Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with blackhole <b>attacks</b> <b>drops</b> to 65. 9 %. With FBIDM, the achieved delivery ratio ranges from 82. 9 % (with a single ferry) to 91. 9 % (with four ferries) with blackhole attacks.
