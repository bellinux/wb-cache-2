Four series of field experiments {{was conducted to}} observe the effectiveness of cultural practice methods for controlling the epidemic of basal stem rot due to G. boninense. Sanitation trial consisted of three treatments i. e root sanitation with big <b>hole</b> <b>planting</b> system, big hole without root sanitation, and standard replanting system as comparison. Hole in hole and standard planting system were compared in the hole in hole trial. Digging and mounding trial was conducted in four treatments, i. e. digging and mounding with teer and Trichoderma, digging and mounding with Trichoderma, mounding with Trichoderma, and infected palm without any treatment as comparison. Meanwhile, a 4 m × 4 m trench {{was used in the}} isolation trench trial. Annual observation was conducted to determine the disease incidence of BSR in each trial. Results showed that all methods could prevent palms from G. boninense infection in the early stage of oil palm development. Proper root sanitation delayed G. boninense infection until 2 years after treatment (YAT), hole in <b>hole</b> <b>planting</b> system was able to suppress disease incidence up to 7 YAT, digging and mounding was useful to prolong the life of the infected palms up to 3 YAT, meanwhile the use of isolation trench was demonstrated to prevent G. boninense infection to neighboring palms up to 2 YAT. </p...|$|E

50|$|Males are not {{considered}} productive members of the nest since they do not remain in their home nests. Instead, they form swarms around clusters of nests as early as 2 days after hatching. Early in the spring, the males are solitary or clustered in small groups, but by late summer they gather in swarms of thousands of bees. Within these swarms there are head-on collisions between bees as they search for females and flowers. While foraging, L. zephyrum searches for flowers, sometimes even forcing them open {{in order to get}} first access to the pollen. Males have been seen landing on small pebbles and small objects as if they were females and have been observed mating as young as 4 days old up until death.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine whether}} the size of <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> and the addition of organic material in the backfill is beneficial for plant establishment and growth during the early years. Acacia farnesiana were transplanted from containers into a permanent landscape using four methods: large <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> with or without amendments or a small <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> with or without amendments. The study was repeated on two sites. Three years following transplanting, plant growth such as height and caliper were not affected by the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> size or amendments, but differed significantly between sites. Plants that received more irrigation and were planted in a less rocky soil had greater caliper and were taller than those supplied with less irrigation and planted on a more rocky soil. Visual observations one and three years after transplanting indicate that trees that were amended with compost in the backfill had the highest incidence of leaning trunks and sinking crowns (20 % of trees in study or 37 % of those receiving amendments) while of those trees that were not amended only one tree (3 %) was leaning three years after transplanting. Hole size at transplanting had no significant effect on leaning or sinking three years after transplanting. These results confirm earlier research across the country that 33 % to 50 % organic amendment in backfill compared to native soil at transplanting is not beneficial for native trees, but increases the risk of leaning or sinking...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A machine {{capable of}} placing <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> {{for a wide}} variety of {{spacings}} in plastic mulch beds with very little physical reconfiguration was designed and tested. The three-point hitch mounted machine was demonstrated with two horticultural crops which have widely varying within-row and between-row spacing requirements: onions and potatoes. The piercing mechanisms were powered by pneumatic cylinders, and the on-board controls allowed users to adjust the number and spacing of holes. Switches enabled between-row spacing to vary by placing from one to four <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> across a standard 76 -cm (30 -in.) bed. For the algorithm used, a dial was set to create the within-row spacing between 15 and 61 cm (6 and 24 in.). These control settings and a fixed tractor speed acted as inputs to a microprocessor which calculated hole placement frequency and initiated cylinder activation. The machine has been in use for two planting seasons with promising results. Hole placement accuracy data were collected for both onions and potatoes. The potato tests were performed for a within-row spacing of 30 cm (12 in.) and produced 96 % of the <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> within 10 % of the target spacing distance. The onion tests were performed for a within-row plant spacing of 15 cm (6 in.) and produced 98 % of the <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> within 10 % of the target spacing distance. The technology used for this research is readily available and is a viable option to accomplish numerous planting configurations with very little reconfiguration of machine components...|$|R
