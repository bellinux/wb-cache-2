This {{makes it possible to}} study quantum kinks in a fully non-perturbative way using Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate this by calculating the kink mass as well as the spectrum and approximate wave functions of its excitations. This way of measuring the kink mass has clear advantages over the existing approaches based on creation and annihilation operators or the <b>kink</b> <b>free</b> energy. Our methods are straightforward to generalise to more realistic theories and other defect types...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{electron}} tunnelling was tackled using a path integral Monte Carlo approach, {{based upon the}} established technique of using the Trotter theorem to transform Feynman's path integral approach into a system able to be modelled classically. The multislice approach to Metropolis Monte Carlo path integral simulation was coupled with the method of expanded ensembles, a technique for calculating the free energy of a system. This enabled the simple calculation of <b>kink</b> <b>free</b> energy differences for complicated potentials, allowing the tunnelling splitting and thus the electron's quantum mechanical tunnelling time to be obtained. Code was developed that allows complex electron tunnelling systems to be studied...|$|E

40|$|A {{discrete}} Klein-Gordon {{model with}} asymmetric potential that supports <b>kinks</b> <b>free</b> of the Peierls-Nabarro potential (PNp) is constructed. Undamped ratchet of kinks under harmonic AC driving force is investigated {{in this model}} numerically and contrasted with the kink ratchets in the conventional discrete model where kinks experience the PNp. We show that the PNp-free kinks exhibit ratchet dynamics very much different from that reported for the conventional lattice kinks which experience PNp [see, e. g., Phys. Rev. E 73, 066621 (2006) ]. Particularly, we could not observe any significant influence of the discreteness parameter on the acceleration of PNp-free kinks induced by the AC driving. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{yielding}} {{around a}} stationary plane strain mode I crack is analyzed using discrete dislocation plasticity. The dislocations {{are all of}} edge character, and are modeled as line singularities in a linear elastic material. Superposition is used to represent the solution in terms of analytical fields for edge dislocations in a half-space and a numerical image solution that enforces the boundary conditions. The description of the dislocation dynamics includes the lattice resistance to dislocation motion, dislocation nucleation, interaction with obstacles and annihilation. A model planar crystal with three slip systems is considered. Two slip system orientations are analyzed that differ by a 90 ° rotation. The non-hardening, single crystal plasticity continuum slip solution for this model crystal predicts that slip and kink bands emerge for both crystal geometries, while later <b>kink</b> band <b>free</b> solutions have been obtained. For a reference set of parameter values, <b>kink</b> band <b>free</b> solutions are found in one orientation while the emergence of kink bands {{is seen in the}} other orientation. However, lowering the dislocation source density suppresses the formation of kink bands in this orientation as well. In all calculations, the opening stress in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip is much larger than predicted by continuum slip theory. ...|$|R

40|$|The novel {{features}} of an asymmetric double gate single halo (DG-SH) doped SOI MOSFET are explored theoretically and {{compared with a}} conventional asymmetric DG SOI MOSFET. The two-dimensional numerical simulation studies demonstrate that the application of single halo to the double gate structure results in threshold voltage roll-up, reduced DIBL, high drain output resistance, <b>kink</b> <b>free</b> output characteristics and increase in the breakdown voltage when compared with a conventional DG structure. For the first time, we show {{that the presence of}} single halo on the source side results in a step function in the surface potential, which screens the source side of the structure from the drain voltage variations.

According to Wu and McCoy's scenario of weak confinement, the fermionic spinon excitations (<b>kinks),</b> being <b>free</b> at h_z = 0 in the ordered phase, are coupled into bosonic bound states at arbitrary small h_z. We calculate the energy spectrum of such excitations in the leading order in small h_z, using different perturbative methods developed for the similar problem in the Ising field theory.

40|$|As an {{extension}} of the class of nonlinear PT -symmetric models, we propose a system of sine-Gordon equations, with the PT symmetry represented by balanced gain and loss in them. The equations are coupled by sine-field terms and first-order derivatives. The sinusoidal coupling stems from local interaction between adjacent particles in coupled Frenkel–Kontorova (FK) chains, while the cross-derivative coupling, which was not considered before, is induced by three-particle interactions, provided that the particles in the parallel FK chains move in different directions. Nonlinear modes are then studied in this system. In particular, kink-kink (KK) and kink-anti-kink (KA) complexes are explored by means of analytical and numerical methods. It is predicted analytically and confirmed numerically that the complexes are unstable for one sign of the sinusoidal coupling and stable for another. Stability regions are delineated in the underlying parameter space. Unstable complexes split into <b>free</b> <b>kinks</b> and anti-kinks that may propagate or become quiescent, depending on whether they are subject to gain or loss, respectively...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} proposed a novel discretization for nonlinear Klein-Gordon field theories {{in which the}} resulting lattice preserves the topological (Bogomol'nyi) lower bound on the kink energy and, as a consequence, has no Peierls-Nabarro barrier even for large spatial discretizations (h~ 1. 0). It was then suggested that these ``topological discrete systems'' are a natural choice for the numerical study of continuum kink dynamics. Giving particular emphasis to the phi^ 4 theory, we numerically investigate kink-antikink scattering and breather formation in these topological lattices. Our results indicate that, even though these systems are quite accurate for studying <b>free</b> <b>kinks</b> in coarse lattices, for legitimate dynamical kink problems the accuracy is rather restricted to fine lattices (h~ 0. 1). We suggest that this fact {{is related to the}} breaking of the Bogomol'nyi bound during the kink-antikink interaction, where the field profile loses its static property as required by the Bogomol'nyi argument. We conclude, therefore, that these lattices are not suitable for the study of more general kink dynamics, since a standard discretization is simpler and has effectively the same accuracy for such resolutions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} thesis: “Ab Initio Study of Pt Induced Nanowires on Ge(001) ”, is {{to model}} the {{experimentally}} observed ‘Pt nanowires’ on Ge(001). These one-atom-thick wires can be hundreds of nanometers long while remaining defect and <b>kink</b> <b>free,</b> providing the ultimate wire any chip designer dreams of. However, experiments show the wires not to be conducting; on the contrary, one-dimensional states are discovered between the wires. To model these nanowires, we combine {{state of the art}} density functional calculations with calculated scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images. First, the beta-terrace substrate is modeled, showing a checkerboard pattern of Pt-Ge and Ge-Ge surface dimers in a Ge(001) -reconstructed surface. Starting from this substrate model, different models with increasing Pt density are developed in an iterative fashion showing increasing agreement with the experimentally observed nanowires. We show that, contrary to previous assumptions, the observed wires are not Pt atoms but Ge atoms, explaining the lacking conductivity. The germanium nanowires consist of Ge dimers located in a Pt-lined trough. In addition, the 4 x 1 periodicity observed in the nanowire-arrays is traced back to the bonds of the Ge nanowire dimers to an extra Pt atom {{at the bottom of the}} trough, resulting in the buckling of the nanowires dimers. In the last part of the thesis we investigate the adsorption of CO on the Ge nanowires under study. The observed adsorption of CO seems to contradict our proposed model due to the high sticking probability of CO on Pt, where it is low on Ge. We show that no contradiction exists. The CO molecules bind to the Pt atoms in the surface, but because they are tilted toward the nanowires, the resulting STM images give the impression that they are located on top of the nanowire giving rise to the apparent contradiction. In this last study, we also discover a very stable CO adsorption configuration in which the CO molecules remain invisible for STM, but could allow for the formation of one-dimensional molecular chains. This would open the door to one-dimensional molecular electronics...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} a {{crystalline}} organic solid has {{a major impact on}} its downstream processing and on its end-product quality, issues that are becoming increasingly important in the specialty chemical industry. In particular, shape affects the key washing and filtering steps in solution crystallization, and it determines solids agglomeration and dissolution characteristics. ^ Traditional models for predicting crystal shape are based exclusively on the internal crystal structure. They are able to predict sublimation-grown crystals, but are not able to account for the effects of the environment (i. e., solvent and impurities) that dominate solution-grown shapes. Detailed kinetic theories of crystal growth—the spiral, two-dimensional nucleation, and rough growth mechanisms—have also been developed, but have not been widely employed. They require as input certain face-specific and solvent-specific properties that are generally unknown. ^ This work explores all of the traditional methods and detailed kinetic theories in an attempt to develop a new method for predicting crystal shape. The detailed kinetic theories are simplified, yielding relative face growth rate expressions that depend primarily on <b>kink</b> and edge <b>free</b> energies—two microscopic properties of crystal faces. A method for estimating these properties is also proposed. It depends on the solvent 2 ̆ 7 s surface free energy, which is often known, and the crystal 2 ̆ 7 s internal energy, which can be determined from simple molecular mechanics calculations. ^ The method is used to predict the {{shape of a}}dipic acid grown from water, ibuprofen grown from polar and non-polar solvents, and biphenyl grown from toluene. An extension to this technique is developed in order to estimate hydrogen bonding between solvents and crystals: it is applied to succinic acid grown from water and isopropanol, and to paracetamol grown from water and acetone. This approach appears to be the first practical technique that can successfully predict solution-grown organic crystal shapes. ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we present}} {{the results of a}} theoretical investigation of spin models on two-dimensional and quasi one-dimensional lattices, all unified under the concept of quantum frustrated antiferromagnetism, and all discussing various aspects of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagomé lattice. In the Introduction (Chapter 1), we discuss at some length such concepts as frustration and superexchange, among others, which are of common relevance {{in the rest of the}} chapters. In Chapter 2, we study the effect of Dzyaloshinskii [...] Moriya (DM) interactions on the zero-temperature magnetic susceptibility of systems whose low energy can be described by short-range valence bond states. Our work shows that this treatment is consistent with the experimentally observed non-vanishing susceptibility [...] in the specified temperature limit [...] of the spin- 1 / 2 kagomé antiferromagnetic compound ZnCu 3 (OH) 6 Cl 2, also known as herbertsmithite. Although the objective of this work is explaining the aforementioned characteristic of the experimental system, our methods are more general and we apply them to the checkerboard and Shastry-Sutherland lattices as well. In Chapter 3, we discuss our findings in the study of ghost-mediated domain wall interactions in the diamondback ladder. These domain walls are the the spin excitations [...] the kinks and the antikinks [...] separating the ground states along one chain of the ladder. While as individual entities an antikink is energy costly and a <b>kink</b> energy <b>free,</b> our study finds that both interact via the ghosts that they produce in the opposite side of the ladder from where they are located. Through the study of these ghosts, we find that domain walls proliferate in the system above a critical value of the system's coupling constants. It is this proliferation that makes their treatment as free, non-interacting particles impossible, so we study here their interactions both quantitatively and qualitatively, in a region where the latter are yet not very strong, namely below the critical point. Based on the calculated two-body interaction potential, domain walls interact attractively (repulsively) when separated at even (odd) distances, with a strength that decays as 1 /s p, where s is their separation and p< 1. We also consider higher-order interactions. In the last chapter, Chapter 4, we present our study of the spin- 1 kagomé Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Our approach is to first consider an SU(2) -symmetric parent Hamiltonian with known ground states on the S= 1 kagomé lattice, in which nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interactions are already present. We then enhance these interactions by an additional Heisenberg term added perturbatively in order to move the system closer to a pure Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The results of this enhancement is obtaining a description of the system in terms of an effective Hamiltonian, namely a transverse field Ising AF on the triangular lattice. Based on the particular values of this effective Hamiltonian, our system is found to be in the order-by-disorder phase...|$|R
