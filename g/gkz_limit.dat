40|$|A {{scenario}} is presented {{on how to}} shift the predicted cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum at 10 ** 20 eV, called the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit (GKZ), to larger energies without breaking the Lorentz invariance. The formulation {{is based on a}} pseudo-complex extension of standard field theory. The dispersion relation of particles can be changed, leading to a modification of the <b>GKZ</b> <b>limit.</b> Maximal shifts are determined. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|A {{prediction}} of standard Big Bang cosmology {{is that the}} observed UHECR (ultra-high-energy cosmic rays) spectrum will exhibit a cutoff at the <b>GKZ</b> <b>limit,</b> resulting from interaction with the photons that constitute the cosmic microwave background. We show that for the Quasi-Static Universe (QSU) model, in which photon energy is an invariant in the cosmological reference frame, the photon number density in the universe today is a factor of 10 ^ 9 less than in the standard model. As a consequence, the mean free path of UHECRs will exceed the horizon distance of the universe, rendering it essentially transparent to UHECRs. The QSU model therefore predicts that no cutoff will be observed in the UHECR spectrum...|$|E
