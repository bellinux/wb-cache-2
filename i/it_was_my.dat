5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium.

25|$|I've {{always been}} fascinated with reality game shows but I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend's idea.

25|$|After {{seven years}} of pain and hard {{struggle}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> hope that the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch. Unfortunately, this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the survey}} {{required}} a short answer portion where participants could write a sentence or so to explain some answers given. Several said they also felt an extreme amount of shame or continued sadness because they had blamed themselves for their partner’s straying. “Because maybe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> fault,” said one survey-taker, a female in her 20s, who experienced {{a high level of}} shame. The survey revealed that 72% of the participants self-esteem was directly affected when their partners cheated on them (Johnson, 2017).|$|E
25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music {{be given to the}} German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> intention to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> fault, nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|E

40|$|I’ve {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that I am the decisive element in the classroom. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> personal approach that creates the climate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> daily mood that makes the weather. As a teacher, I possess a tremendous power to make a child’s life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In every situation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> response that determines whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated and a child humanized or de-humanized. ...|$|R

500|$|Reagan's {{ability to}} connect with Americans earned him the laudatory moniker [...] "The Great Communicator." [...] Of it, Reagan said, [...] "I won the {{nickname}} the great communicator. But I never thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E
500|$|They quickly {{established}} a strong friendship, with Olivia listening sympathetically to his obsessive love for Maud. When Yeats later described their friendship, he wrote, [...] "I {{told her of}} my love sorrow, indeed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> obsession, never leaving by day or night". Writing in The Last Courtly Lover, Gloria Kline suggests Olivia and Yeats began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work.|$|E

Coach Yost noted, [...] "I knew long before I came to Michigan of the great rivalry existing between this University and the University of Chicago. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> desire to win this game above all others." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{never thought}} 'God, I wish Neil Peart {{was in this}} band.' It's kind of funny: When people {{critique}} hip hop, they're scared to open up, {{for fear of being}} called racist. But they're not scared to open up on female musicians, out of pure sexism. Meg is the best part of this band. It never would have worked with anybody else, because it would have been too complicated... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> doorway to playing the blues." ...|$|E

She said [...] "I guess <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> rebellious phase. It wasn't really for me. I kind of smartened up and tried to distance myself from that."

And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to." ...|$|E
