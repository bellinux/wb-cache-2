25|$|Rising {{demand for}} {{biofuels}} {{is expected to}} be <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> biotechnology sector, with the Department of Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.|$|E

MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM that both parties agreed to limit ABM {{deployment}} largely {{as a way of}} avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks {{had to be able to}} credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defense around Moscow.

Charles, with a small contingent of troops, returned to Scotland and invaded England. He had some reason to believe in his ultimate success as all but 8,000 British troops were away on the continent and recently defeated at Fontenoy. Charles' return to Scotland combined with a stunning victory at the Battle of Prestonpans obliged Cumberland to pull his army back to England {{to deal with the}} Jacobite invasion. The British government was greatly concerned with developments in Flanders but the military tide had turned in France's favour.

Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals. In three years, the proceeds from the lease were all but spent.|$|E

For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually.
