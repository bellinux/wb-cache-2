The weak intensities {{are in the range}} of 107 - 108 W cm- 2. The calculations incorporated systematically electronic structure and electron correlation effects. They were done by implementing a time-independent, nonperturbative many-electron, many-photon theory (MEMPT) which obtains cycle-averaged complex eigenvalues, whose real part gives the field-induced energy shift, Δ, and the imaginary part is the multiphoton ionization rate, Γ. Through analysis, plausible arguments and computation, we show that when the intensities are weak the dependence of Γ on phase differences is simple. Specifically, Γs are depicted in the form of plane surfaces, with minor ripples due to higher order <b>ionization</b> <b>paths,</b> in terms of trigonometric functions of the phase differences. This dependence is likely to be applicable to other atomic systems as well, and to provide a definition of the weak field regime in the trichromatic case.

40|$|A simple random <b>ionization</b> <b>path</b> length {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} the breakdown probabilities and jitter in single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with submicron multiplication widths. The simulation results show that increasing the multiplication width may not necessarily increase the breakdown probability relative to the breakdown voltage, as the effect of dead space becomes more dominant in thinner multiplication regions at realistic ionization threshold energies for GaAs. On the other hand, reducing the multiplication width results in smaller breakdown time and jitter, despite the increased dead space. The effect of dead space in degrading breakdown time and jitter is relatively weak and further compensated by the stronger influence of large feedback ionization at high fields. Thus, SPAD designs that can minimize the dark count rate may potentially benefit from enhanced breakdown probability, breakdown time, and jitter by reducing {{the thickness of the}} multiplication region.

In order to probe the fragmentation dynamics of molecular ions, we have developed a coincidence three-dimensional momentum imaging method that allows the kinematically complete study of all fragments except electrons. Recent upgrades to this method allow the measurement of slow dissociation fragments, down to nearly zero velocity, in intense ultrafast laser fields. Evidences for the low energy breakup are presented using the benchmark molecules diatomic H[subscript] 2 [superscript]+ and polyatomic H[subscript] 3 [superscript]+. The low energy fragments in H[subscript] 2 [superscript]+ dissociation are due to the intriguing zero-photon dissociation phenomenon. This first experimental evidence for the zero-photon dissociation is further supported by sophisticated theoretical treatment. We have explored the laser pulse length, intensity, wavelength, and chirp dependence of zero-photon dissociation of H[subscript] 2 [superscript]+, and the results are well described by a two-photon process based on stimulated Raman scattering. Similar studies of the slow dissociation of H[subscript] 3 [superscript]+ reveal that two-body dissociation is dominant over three-body dissociation. The most likely pathways leading to low-energy breakup into H[superscript]++H[subscript] 2, in contradiction to the assessments of the channels in at least one previous study, are explored by varying the laser pulse duration and the wavelength. In addition, we have investigated the dissociation and single ionization of N[subscript] 2 [superscript]+, and an interesting high energy feature in addition to the low energy has been observed at higher intensities. Such high energy results from the breakup of molecules in excited states are accessible at higher intensities where their potential energy is changing rapidly with the internuclear distance. We have extended the intense field ionization studies to other molecular ions N[subscript] 2 [superscript]+, CO[superscript]+, NO[superscript]+, and O[subscript] 2 [superscript]+. The dissociative ionization of these molecules follow a general mechanism, a stairstep ionization mechanism. Utilizing the capability of the upgraded experimental method we have measured the non-dissociative and dissociative ionization of CO[superscript]+ using different pulse lengths.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with the interaction of an atom with an intense laser field. By numerically integrating the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in one-dimension we investigate the phenomenon of stabilization, whereby an atom interacting with a high frequency intense laser pulse can become relatively stable against ionization. We study how stabilization is effected by the laser pulse shape, pulse duration, intensity, range of potential and the displacement of the electron {{at the end of the}} pulse. Shorter range potentials are more effected by this displacement than the longer range potentials, for which we observe a greater degree of stabilization. A strong field approximation and a high frequency approximation are compared with the numerical solution to the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The strong field approximation successfully describes the dynamics of the atom for very short laser pulses, while the high frequency approximation gives results which are in good agreement for longer pulse shapes. We discuss a simple physical picture of the laser-atom dynamics in the intense, high frequency, short pulse regime. We extend our investigation of stabilization in one-dimension by numerically integrating the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in two-dimensions, and study the effects of laser pulse rise times and laser ellipticity. We compare the structure of the stabilized wavepackets to the corresponding Kramers-Henneberger (K-H) ground states. Non-adiabatic evolution of the system leads to extra structure in the stabilized wavepackets due to the excitation of higher K-H states. Shake off ionization dominates for short laser pulses while photoionization is dominant for longer pulses. Finally, we apply an essential states method to study a one-photon resonant, two-photon ionization atom-laser system. The quantum interference between the two different <b>ionization</b> <b>paths</b> depends on the relative phase between the applied lasers. Our results show that the time-dependence of the ionization probability, the population in the bound states and the form of the photoelectron energy spectra can be controlled by varying the phase difference between the lasers. For specific atomic parameters and phase, population can be entirely trapped within a superposition of bound states thus being totally immune to decay.

40|$|An {{analytical}} band Monte Carlo (AMC) {{model has}} been developed to study the high field electron transport and the impact ionization in bulk gallium antimonide (GaSb). The AMC model uses three non-parabolic spherical valleys; in which Γ valley and L valley represent the first conduction band, while X valley represents the second conduction band. The scattering mechanisms included in this model are polar optical phonon, acoustic phonon, non-polar optical phonon (equivalent and non-equivalent intervalley), ionized impurity and impact ionization. The peak drift velocity occurs at 10 kV/cm and the saturation velocity is 8 × 104 m/s. Since the intervalley energy separation between the Γ valley and L valley is only 0. 0847 eV, most electrons have already populated the higher valleys under small electric field. Thus, electrons in GaSb do not have sufficient time to acquire larger energy and lead to lower velocity before transfer to higher valley. This also leads to lower average electron energy for GaSb. The weak field dependence of GaSb at low field is attributed to majority of electrons impact ionising within the first conduction band. The impact ionization coefficient for GaSb is {{higher than that of}} InGaAs as GaSb has higher ionization rates.

40|$|INTRODUCTION A Geiger-Mueller (GM) tube is a {{gas-filled}} radiation detector. It commonly {{takes the}} form of a cylindrical outer shell (cathode) and the sealed gas-filled space with a thin central wire (the anode) held at - 1 KV positive voltage with respect to the cathode. The fill gas is generally argon at a pressure of less than 0. 1 arm plus a small quantity of a quenching vapor (whose function is described below). If a gamma ray (- ray) interacts with the GM tube (primarily with the wall by either the Photoelectric Effect or Compton scattering) it will produce an energetic electron that may pass through the interior of the tube. Figure 1. The principal mechanism by which gas-filled counters are sensitive to - rays involves ejection of electrons from the counter wall. Only those interactions that occur within an electron range of the wall's inner surface can result in an output pulse. <b>Ionization</b> along the <b>path</b> of the primary electron results in low energy electrons that will b...|$|R
40|$|An {{existing}} anisotropic anodic plasma contactor {{model is}} extended to include neutral gas emissions. Within {{the framework of}} the contactor model, the inclusion of external ionization leads to an integrodifferential equation. By choosing the ratio of the contactor radius to the neutral gas-electron <b>ionization</b> mean free <b>path</b> at the contactor exit as a suitable expansion parameter, an analytical expression for the current-voltage characteristic can be found. The performance of this contactor model is examined via a dynamic simulation model developed for electrodynamic tethers. Detailed models of the geomagnetic field and the ionosphere are used to create a realistic environment. The highly nonlinear contactor voltagle-current characteristic is incorporated into a circuit equation, which includes radiation impedance, and is solved along the tether's orbit. Results show that it is more effective to fully ionize the contactor gas internally, than to partially ionize it externally, and that based on the specific power for the tether system, the optimum gas to use is argon. In addition, the effect of the radiation impedance on tether system performance is examined...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{conditioning}} cycle of {JET} İLW} is analysed and compared with restart and operation in 2008 with a carbon dominated wall. Comparable water and oxygen decay times are observed during bake-out in both cases. Despite a 2 &#xa 0;×&#xa 0; 10 − 3 &#xa 0;mbar&#xa 0;l/s leak rate during plasma operation, no further wall conditioning has been necessary after plasma restart in ILW, which dramatically contrasts with 2008. Plasma O content is lower with the ILW. Higher O levels are measured after nights or week-ends, BeO layers being formed and re-eroded, {{but do not}} impact plasma operation and performance. First results on isotopic wall changeover by {GDC} on the İLW} {{six months of the}} first {D 2 } campaign evidence a reservoir of about 3 &#xa 0;×&#xa 0; 1022 &#xa 0;atoms, i. e. ten time lower than in carbon PFCs.
