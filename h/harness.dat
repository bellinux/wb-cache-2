5|$|In the 19th century, Morgans {{were used}} {{extensively}} for <b>harness</b> racing, {{as well as}} for pulling coaches, due to the breed's speed and endurance in <b>harness.</b> They were also used as stock horses and for general riding, as well as light driving work. Miners in the California Gold Rush (1848–1855) used the breed, as did the Army during and after the American Civil War for both riding and <b>harness</b> horses.|$|E
5|$|Right after Gaga {{performed}} in the Super Bowl LI halftime show, many media outlets pointed out similarities between {{the beginning of the}} show where she descended from the roof of NRG Stadium from a <b>harness</b> to a similar scene in this episode in which she descends from a helicopter on a <b>harness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is {{slower to}} mature than lighter breeds, and thus usually enters <b>harness</b> racing {{competition}} {{at the age of}} four. However, its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and the breed's effective competition career can be very long. The Finnish <b>harness</b> racing bylaws allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16.|$|E
40|$|AbstractContempoary {{research}} on the {{soil and water conservation}} benefit mainly focus on the benefit calculation after a certain <b>harnessing</b> stage. However, little was known about how the <b>harnessing</b> messures affect the runoff and sediment during the <b>harnessing</b> process. This paper takes Lianshui watershed as the research object to analyze 32 years’ monitoring data of the outlet station in this watershed by virtue of Mann-Kendall Test and calculate quantificationally the contribution of long-term soil and water conservation measures <b>harnessing</b> to the runoff and sediment yield of this watershed in different stages by virtue of mathematical model, thus to identify the influence on long-term long-scale soil and water conservation measures <b>harnessing</b> on runoff and sediment yield variation. The results have showed that: After the 3 soil and water conservation <b>harnessing</b> stages during the period from 1983 to 2002, the sediment yield of Lianshui watershed has significantly decreased, however, the annual runoff hasn’t been changed along with the extension of the <b>harnessing</b> period, with regard to the influence on sediment reduction in the watershed, the contribution rate of water and soil conservation measures was 41. 41 % compared with the natural factors after 1 st <b>harnessing</b> stage (1991 - 1998), 49. 74 % after 2 nd <b>harnessing</b> stage (1999 - 2002), and in 3 rd <b>harnessing</b> stage (2003 - 2009) it reached 67. 68 %, {{it can be seen that}} the influence of water and soil conservation measures on watershed sediment yield can gradually increase along with the extension of <b>harnessing</b> period and continuous expansion of <b>harnessing</b> scale and eventually become the dominant factor...|$|R

5|$|In the 21st century, {{approximately}} 75percent of Finnhorses {{are used}} {{at some point}} in their lives for <b>harness</b> racing, with riding being the second most popular use. Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in <b>harness</b> racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E

50|$|While <b>harnesses</b> can be improvised, it is {{more common}} to use commercially {{produced}} <b>harnesses,</b> which often include padding and amenities such as gear loops.

5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder <b>harness</b> and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the <b>harness</b> locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E

50|$|<b>Harnesses</b> are {{not only}} good dog {{handling}} tools, as they are also used for training. There {{are a variety of}} dog training <b>harnesses,</b> usually made of nylon or leather. Both of these materials are perfect for this purpose. Commonly, nylon <b>harnesses</b> are cheaper than leather ones. There are specially designed <b>harnesses</b> with fully padded chest plate for agitation, protection, and attack training. The chest plate absorbs the shock during the hit, thus preventing serious injuries to the dog. This is especially vital for those dogs who are trained on daily basis.|$|R

5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest <b>harness</b> called a marking <b>harness</b> that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E

5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. <b>Harness</b> racing and associated parimutuel betting, {{and to some degree}} also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring the survival of the breed.|$|E

5000|$|Twill weave {{is often}} {{designated}} as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of <b>harnesses</b> that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of <b>harnesses</b> that are lowered when a filling yarn is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction [...] is read as [...] "two up, one down" [...] (the fraction for plain weave is [...]). The minimum number of <b>harnesses</b> needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of <b>harnesses</b> is three. Twill weave can be identified by its diagonal lines.|$|R
