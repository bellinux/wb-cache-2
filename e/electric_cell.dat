6000|$|When I had {{finished}} my medical education in 1882, I found myself, like many young medical men, a convinced materialist as regards our personal destiny. I had never {{ceased to be}} an earnest theist, because {{it seemed to me}} that Napoleon's question to the atheistic professors on the starry night as he voyaged to Egypt: [...] "Who was it, gentlemen, who made these stars?" [...] has never been answered. To say that the Universe was made by immutable laws only put the question one degree further back as to who made the laws. I did not, of course, believe in an anthropomorphic God, but I believed then, as I believe now, in an intelligent Force behind all the operations of Nature--a force so infinitely complex and great that my finite brain could get no further than its existence. Right and wrong I saw also as great obvious facts which needed no divine revelation. But when it came to a question of our little personalities surviving death, {{it seemed to me that}} the whole analogy of Nature was against it. When the candle burns out the light disappears. When the <b>electric</b> <b>cell</b> is shattered the current stops. When the body dissolves there is an end of the matter. Each man in his egotism may feel that he ought to survive, but let him look, we will say, at the average loafer--of high or low degree--would anyone contend that there was any obvious reason why THAT personality should carry on? It seemed to be a delusion, and I was convinced that death did indeed end all, though I saw no reason why that should affect our duty towards humanity during our transitory existence.|$|E

50|$|Because of some {{tensions}} in the relations between Russia and France, Grotthuss had to leave for Italy where he stayed at Naples for one year. The discovery of the first <b>electric</b> <b>cell</b> in 1800 by Alessandro Volta provided the scientists a source of electricity which was used in various laboratory experiments around Europe. The electrolysis of water, acids and salt solutions was reported, but a good explanation was missing. Grotthuss actively contributed to this area {{both in terms of}} electrolysis experiments and their interpretation. During his stay in Italy, he published his work on electrolysis in 1806. His idea that the charge is not transported by the movement of particles but by breaking and reformation of bonds was the first basically correct concept for the charge transport in electrolytes; it still valid for the charge transport in water, and the current proton hopping mechanism is {{a modified version of the}} original Grotthuss mechanism.|$|E

Some toxicants in these experiments by using chemical methods would affect the mechanisms of the assays. So, the results would become invalid. However, for the electronic cell counter, it can not only monitor all the cells changes, even the cell necrosis, by various toxicants types and concentration, but also a complex mixture of toxicants in the cell culture. It would be seen that the progress changes of dying cells can be detected as well.

50|$|Action of {{a magnet}} on current and how {{rotational}} motion is produced {{due to this}} can be shown by Barlow's wheel experiment. The apparatus consists of a star shaped copper wheel capable of rotating freely in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. The point of each spoke of the star just dips into a pool of mercury kept in a small groove on the wooden base of the apparatus. The pool of mercury is kept in between the two opposite poles of a strong magnet. The wheel rotates with its plane being perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field and during its rotation only one point of the star dips into the pool of mercury at a time. When the axis of the wheel and the mercury are connected to <b>electric</b> <b>cell,</b> the circuit is completed through the axis of the wheel (when a point dips in the mercury) and the mercury. On passing current through the circuit the wheel will begin to rotate due to the action of the magnet on the current. The direction of rotation of the wheel can be determined by applying Fleming's left hand rule. While rotating and when a spoke of the wheel just leaves the mercury the circuit breaks but due to inertia of motion the wheel continues its motion and brings the next spoke in contact with the mercury thereby restoring the electrical contact. In this way rotation of the wheel continues. On reversing the direction of the current or that of the magnetic field the wheel rotates in the opposite direction. The speed of rotation depends upon the strength of the magnetic field and the strength of the current. Here mechanical energy is obtained from electrical energy.|$|E
5000|$|His {{next book}} was a science-fiction novel Sunset. The novel {{featured}} the radio astronomy experiments of an English physicist John Byford who sent wireless messages into outer space using a photo <b>electric</b> <b>cell</b> gadget. He eventually received a reply from Nerina who was living on a planet three light years from earth. Life on that planet was sterile and dying from cosmic wave radiation. Byford is murdered by criminals who seem to originate from both Germanic and Slavic parts of Europe. A fake message which is attributed to Byford appears in a Russian newspaper and is then syndicated throughout the English-speaking world. The message is based on his contact with Nerina and includes the fruits of eight years research in astronomy and mathematics. The message claims that within two months all life on earth will perish from the same cosmic wave radiation that has ruined Nerina's planet. The novel depicts different reactions to [...] "the Sunset Scare" [...] such as a London advertising agency, major newspapers, and the Stock Exchange reacting to financial panic. There are acts of mob violence as food prices soar. Some wealthy financiers seem to be making lots of money from the panic. In London a large crowd listens to a sermon delivered by the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral based on the Book of Job and the church service climaxes with an organ rendition of part of Handel's Messiah. The plot includes the investigations of the Archbishop of Canterbury who analyses the message attributed to Byford and concludes {{that it is a}} fake. The last portion of the novel includes notes about Byford's experiments and his reflections on the meaning of life that centre on questions about the universe having a purpose, animal cruelty, and passages that he has meditated upon from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The Papyri were discovered in Egypt in 1903 and contain statements attributed to Jesus that are not recorded in the Bible.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a new micro {{electroporation}} (EP) cell chip with three-dimensional (3 D) electrodes was fabricated {{by means}} of MEMS technology, and tested on cervical cancer (HeLa) cells.

In addition, these boundary curves (i. e., electric field versus pulse duration) were fitted successfully with an exponential function with three constants. We found that, when the molecular size increases, the corresponding electroporation boundary becomes closer to the <b>electric</b> <b>cell</b> lysis boundary. Based on more than 2000 single-cell measurements on five different size molecules, the critical size of molecule {{was found to be}} approximately 40 kDa.
