Peter perhaps being denigrated for his actions around the crucifixion. Most scholars disagree with this view.

His youthful vigour is thus a common explanation for why he beats Peter. The Disciple's great love for Jesus is also considered as a possible explanation.|$|E

Interpretation there have been in texts and religious teachings in all religions, especially among Christians and Jews. With the advent of Islam and the revelation of the holy Quran, the Muslim interpretation of divine revelations became widespread. No one is denied interpretation of Islamic sects. Many Islamic sects like the Mu'tazili and Shi'a, and groups such as Sufis have shown to interpretation special attention. But this thinking has an important place in Ismailia and is based on the philosophical foundations. They extended interpretation to all the religious appearances and believe that the Scriptures are the secrets and hints that the facts and secrets hidden in it. Instances Ismaili interpretations can be divided into three major groups. 1) interpretation of Quranic verses and hadiths to levels their religious degrees into three parts interpret Quranic verses of the mind and the soul, the interpretation of the verses to the "asas", the interpretation of some verses of the Hojjat, Bab, Daie, Maezon and Mostajib divided. 2) Numerical interpretations and taste, such as the interpretation of the word "No God but Allah" in "vajh Din". 3) Interpretations of the legal and practical minutiae such as the interpretation of prayer and fasting that the interpretation given to religious orders Naser Khosrow, thoughtful prominent Ismailis as "Hojjat" of the Ismaili sect, over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> in its prose and poetry, is used and believes that religious education has the appearance and reality and religion without interpretation does not have any value and like a body without soul. And he who does not know the essence of religion, deprived not only of religion, but hated the Prophet (pbuh) also. He rejects the revelation appearance in his poems without interpretation and the revelation appearance as sea salt and interpretation as pearl knows. He considered interpretation of the feather wisdom and knowledge. Naser Khosrow widely in your prose books devoted to the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> and in his own "Vajh Din" has some interpretations. In this article, the  literally and idiomatic meaning the interpreter, is examined and then to the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Quran, hadith, philosophy, theology, mysticism and Sufism and hermeneutics are paid. Then the the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> from the perspective of Ismailia, especially Hakim Naser Khosrow mentioned. Ismailis, according to default "Masal & Mamsul" have been extended interpretation to all the religious and their works full of religious interpretation and interpretation of numerical minutiae and interpretation of genetic and intellectual affairs. Although Ismailis consider the Imam to interpret teacher and believe that this interpretation will have them, however, quotes are not documentary in his speech. Works like Meybodi`s Kashf al-Asrar the mystical verses have been interpreted, On the basis of taste and mystical interpretations written. In fact, this works are aspect of literary and artistic and Poetic and these words, all the whispers of love and the main difference is with the Ismaili interpretations.
