50|$|More {{recently}} in 2011/12 was {{the addition of}} a Picatinny rail to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two <b>hollow</b> <b>roll</b> pins, one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{continuous}} tube rolling process, {{wall thickness}} reduction per stand {{will be changed}} due to wall thickness fluctuation of pierced shell caused by piercing process, which results in changes in metal flow conditions and affects force parameters, deformation parameters, especially transverse wall thickness precision of <b>rolled</b> <b>hollow</b> tube. In this paper, {{with the aid of}} commercial FE code MSC. SuperForm, the high pressure boiler steel tube continuous rolling process of a typical hollow tube specification 133. 0 × 4. 0 mm are simulated based on 133 main pass sequence of 89 mm 6 -stand semi-floating mandrel mill, and force parameters, equivalent plastic strain, transverse wall thickness precision, outline dimension and real roundness of <b>rolled</b> <b>hollow</b> tube are analyzed and compared on the condition of two different wall thicknesses of pierced shell. Analysis results indicate that force parameters increase with wall thickness of pierced shell, maximal rolling force, rolling moment and mandrel axial force increase 10 % or so in the first three stands when rolling pierced shell of wall thickness 11. 5 mm compared to that of wall thickness 10. 5 mm. When rolling pierced shell of wall thickness 10. 5 mm, there exist front and back tensions among the third, the fourth and the fifth stands and outline dimension and real roundness of <b>rolled</b> <b>hollow</b> tube is slightly better. However, transverse wall thickness of <b>rolled</b> <b>hollow</b> tube at the bottom of groove is pulled thin obviously...|$|R

The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the suction (couch) roll. The couch <b>roll</b> is a <b>hollow</b> shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The <b>hollow</b> shell <b>roll</b> rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|R
60|$|But {{the task}} was as severe a one as the most {{fighting}} General could ask for. On the southern side the banks formed a long slope which could be shaved as with a razor by the rifle fire of the enemy. How to advance across that broad open zone was indeed a problem. It {{was one of many}} occasions in this war in which one wondered why, if a bullet-proof shield capable of sheltering a lying man could be constructed, a trial should not be given to it. Alternate rushes of companies with a safe rest after each rush would save the troops from the continued tension of that deadly never ending fire. However, it is idle to discuss what might have been done to mitigate their trials. The open ground had to be passed, and then they came to--not the enemy, but a broad and deep river, with a single bridge, probably undermined, and a single ford, which was found not to exist in practice. Beyond the river was tier after tier of hills, crowned with stone walls and seamed with trenches, defended by thousands of the best marksmen in the world, supported by an admirable artillery. If, in spite of the advance over the open and in spite of the passage of the river, a ridge could still be carried, it was only to be commanded by the next; and so, one behind the other, like the billows of the ocean, a series of hills and <b>hollows</b> <b>rolled</b> northwards to Ladysmith. All attacks must be in the open. All defence was from under cover. Add to this, that the young and energetic Louis Botha was in command of the Boers. It was a desperate task, and yet honour forbade that the garrison should be left to its fate. The venture must be made.|$|R

25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} <b>hollow</b> {{tubes of}} <b>rolled</b> up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One {{direction}} of the cross wedge rolling technology is to realize high-efficiency, precise and near-net-shape forming hollow axle with multi-wedge synchrostep cross wedge rolling. This paper deduced the rotated condition of forming hollow shaft with multi-wedge cross wedge rolling (MCWR) base on forming solid shaft with single-wedge cross wedge rolling, and analyzed technics parameters {{on the influence of}} rotated conditions. Through the finite element simulation we got rolling technics parameters on the effect of rolled piece and selecting principle, and then created the 3 D model of the equal diameter period of hollow axle with the MCWR. By using DEFORM- 3 D software, the process of rolling equal diameter period was simulated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{technical}} solution to implement traceability {{by means of}} RFID technology in the paper industry is presented. One of the main problems {{in the production of}} packaging paper is linked to inbound quality controls and to the warehouse management of the supplied material (i. e. paper rolls). Moreover, during the production process, single paper rolls may remain unfinished, forcing to store the remainder for eventual successive manufactures. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a proper Warehouse Tracking System (WTS) that permits to manage the stockroom in a effective and quick way. The proposed technical solution consists in inserting an active RFID transponder within the <b>hollow</b> of the <b>rolls,</b> fixing and protecting it by means of a suitably configured light rubber case. The operator must only apply the case with a single move during transportation from supplier trucks to the warehouse and from the warehouse to the manufacturing facility and vice-versa. A feasibility and economical study addressed to the cost estimation of the management of a single handled paper roll has been provided to justify the adoption of the proposed solution...|$|R

Elspat's kindred were of those who crossed themselves and knelt when the sacring bell was rung, and she knows that atonement can {{be made on the}} altar for deeds done in the field. Elspat had once flocks and herds, goats upon the cliffs, and cattle in the strath. She wore gold around her neck and on her hair--thick twists, as those worn by the heroes of old. All these would she have resigned to the priest--all these; and if he wished for the ornaments of a gentle lady, or the sporran of a high chief, though they had been great as Macallum Mhor himself, MacTavish Mhor would have procured them, if Elspat had promised them. Elspat is now poor, and has nothing to give. But the Black Abbot of Inchaffray would have bidden her scourge her shoulders, and macerate her feet by pilgrimage; and he would have granted his pardon to her when he saw that her blood had flowed, and that her flesh had been torn. These were the priests who had indeed power even with the most powerful; they threatened the great men of the earth with the word of their mouth, the sentence of their book, the blaze of their torch, the sound of their sacring bell. The mighty bent to their will, and unloosed at the word of the priests those whom they had bound in their wrath, and set at liberty, unharmed, him whom they had sentenced to death, and for whose blood they had thirsted. These were a powerful race, and might well ask the poor to kneel, since their power could humble the proud.
