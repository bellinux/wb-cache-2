5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when <b>fighting</b> against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character <b>fighting</b> styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple <b>fighting</b> stances.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fighting</b> beetles {{are used}} for {{entertainment}} and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. In the Chiang Mai district of northern Thailand, male Xylotrupes rhinoceros beetles {{are caught in the}} wild and trained for <b>fighting.</b> Females are held inside a log to stimulate the <b>fighting</b> males with their pheromones. These fights may be competitive and involve gambling both money and property. In South Korea the Dytiscidae species Cybister tripunctatus is used in a roulette-like game.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fighting</b> {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first <b>fighting</b> game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as <b>fighting</b> games. <b>Fighting</b> games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E

5|$|Many {{publications}} also listed Mortal Kombat II {{among the}} best video games of its genre or era. It was ranked as the third best <b>fighting</b> game by the staff of GamePro and the ninth best <b>fighting</b> game of all time by Rich Knight of Cinema Blend in 2008, as the third top <b>fighting</b> game of all time by Marissa Meli of UGO and the second best 2D <b>fighting</b> game ever made by Robert Workman of GamePlayBook in 2010, and as the third best <b>fighting</b> game of all time by Peter Rubin of Complex in 2011. It was also ranked as the 53rd best game on any Nintendo platform by the staff of Nintendo Power in 1997, featured among the 100 best games of the 20th century by Jakub Kralka of Benchmark in 2009, and ranked as the tenth best 16-bit game ever by McKinley Noble of PC World that same year.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are highly}} {{territorial}} and aggressive ants which establish firm borders between neighbouring colonies. While the boundaries are not physical, worker ants maintain them {{by engaging in}} ritualised <b>fighting</b> with opponent ants, an interaction most colonies engage in. Fatalities are rare on both sides, but fights may cause injuries to several workers. This <b>fighting</b> enables territory to be contested between opposing colonies without them killing each other and costing many casualties on both sides. Due of this, it is a method of avoiding casualties and promotes intercolony communication and assessment. A drainage {{of the work force}} would occur if these boundaries acted as a conflict zone if ritualised <b>fighting</b> did not take place. Lethal <b>fighting</b> only occurs if the colony is under attack.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, GameSpot {{named it}} the best <b>fighting</b> game of E3 2004. It was also {{the winner of the}} 2004 GameSpot Top Spike TV Video Game Awards in the {{category}} of best <b>fighting</b> game.

The PlayStation 2 version was a runner-up in IGN's PS2 Best of 2004 Awards in the best <b>fighting</b> game category, and won the Readers' Choice.

5|$|Similar to <b>fighting</b> in ice hockey, <b>fighting</b> is tolerated in {{professional}} box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian Lacrosse Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. <b>Fighting</b> in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, <b>fighting</b> was specifically targeted as unacceptable. Violators were {{ejected from the}} game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension.|$|E
5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of <b>fighting</b> in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The <b>fighting</b> was particularly dangerous as <b>fighting</b> was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the <b>fighting</b> beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E
