40|$|Globalization {{leads to}} {{economic}} benefits for some countries but {{may have also}} many serious negative side effects for others. The increased mobility of economic activities {{may result in a}} sharp increase in <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> between countries. On the one hand, <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> can have desirable consequences, such as more efficiency, but on the other side it may also have undesirable or harmful consequences, such as race to the bottom. Also, the increasing using of tax havens has resulted in erosion of many countries’ tax bases. From of the point of view, {{there is a need to}} revisiting the debate on <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> and to answer whether the <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> is beneficial or harmful. For this reason, this paper discusses the significance of <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> in the European Union and deals with the position of <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> in the European Single Market. This paper discusses an economic purpose of <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> at currently European Single Market and discusses about <b>harmful</b> effects of <b>tax</b> <b>competition.</b> Based on the findings in this paper the following overall conclusion is drawn.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on <b>tax</b> <b>competition,</b> and uses it to analyse current European proposals to harmonise corporate tax rates. It begins, {{in the course of}} Section One, by introducing the phenomenon of international <b>tax</b> <b>competition,</b> and illustrates, with the use of secondary research, the reality of the regulatory "race to the bottom". Section Two, however, demonstrates the <b>harmful</b> consequences of <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> - with reference to the immobile factors of production - and makes obvious the necessity of effective intervention. Section Three then introduces and evaluates the calibre of the current proposals to tackle <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> through collusion and harmonisation, and concludes negatively in the process. As illustrated in this discussion, any efforts to harmonise corporate taxes above the international equilibrium will not only fail to solve the problem at hand, but will exacerbate them, and may even serve to undermine and destabilise the political Union. Section Four then introduce an alternative solution to the problem - {{in the form of the}} residence principle - and Section Five concludes.

40|$|Transparency {{represents}} today a {{key issue}} on the agendas of international and domestic tax policy makers. Improving the access and the exchange of relevant tax information and removing existing bank and tax secrecy regimes is currently seen as the most effective tool, together with the identification of <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> regimes and practices, to counter both <b>tax</b> evasion and <b>harmful</b> or aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>competition.</b> Action item 13 of the BEPS Action Plan suggests to reform {{the structure of the}} transfer pricing documentation and introduce a new reporting requirement {{in the form of a}} countryby-country reporting template. Although such new reporting requirement is meant to provide an informative tool for the up-front identification of transfer pricing risks within the group, its unexpected area of application may become the improvement of the global acceptance of the formulary apportionment idea for the allocation of multinational enterprises’ profits.

The {{reason is that}} it induces, by restricting <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> practices, cuts in generic tax rates that may reduce tax revenue even further. If one presupposes a benevolent utility maximising government, then this worsens the underprovision of public goods.

40|$|A two-region {{model is}} {{presented}} in which an imperfectly competitive firm produces a good with increasing returns at the plant level, and in which shipping costs exist between the two markets. Production of the good causes local pollution, and regional governments can levy pollution taxes or impose environmental regulations. The firm decides. partly {{on the basis of}} these environmental policy variables, whether to maintain plants in both regions, serve both regions from a single plant or shut down. A non-cooperative equilibrium in regional environmental policies occurs when each region is choosing the environmental policy that maximizes its welfare given the environmental policy in the other region. Two types of <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> (regulatory) <b>competitions</b> are documented. If the disutility of pollution is high enough, each region will only want the polluting good produced in the other region and the two regions will likely compete by increasing their environmental taxes (standards) until the polluting firm is driven from the market. This is the case of "Not in my backyard". Alternatively, if the disutility from pollution is not as great, each region will realize that their welfare could decrease if their environmental policy causes the firm to not operate in their region. In this case, the regions will usually compete by undercutting each others pollution tax rates (environmental standards). ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Harmful</b> <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> {{in income}} tax between {{the member states}} of the UE is a normal {{phenomenon}} since the common market was created. Certainly it has increased {{in recent years and}} now represents an important obstacle {{on the way to the}} European Single Market, causing inequality between the member states. The European Commission, in its role of the guardian of competition in the UE made a legal proposal in March 2011, with the objective of bringing the <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> to an end (Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base). In this article we summarise the official communiqué, evaluating whether the tendency of each single member state to the Commission proposal is positive or negative. Afterwards we confront the most frequent arguments of the member states with the proposal of the Commission to find out its weaknesses and strength. Finally we use this information to make our own suggestions for improvement. ...|$|E

This section will also outline the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s emergence and role in international taxation issues. Furthermore, this section will discuss globalization and its contribution to the growth of preferential tax regimes, thus facilitating the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s remedial effort. Section II analyzes the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s reports, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Competition: An Emerging Global Issue 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 21998 Report 2 ̆ 2) and 2 ̆ 2 Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Practices 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 22000 Report 2 ̆ 2), which are the focal points of the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s effort.

Additionally, this effort deviates from traditional measures utilized to remedy international fiscal issues, specifically double taxation, and will likely result in stifling global economic development.

We consider two types of transfer programs: tax base and tax revenue equaliza-tion. The framework developed yields results which agree with empirical evidences and exhibits two types of ine ¢ ciencies due to noncooperative behavior: the tax rates are too low in both regions and the di¤erence in tax rates can be too high. Both externalities imply that the provision of public good is too low from an e ¢ ciency viewpoint.

40|$|Hidden {{from the}} public eye {{financial}} capital has been completely reconfigured over {{the past thirty years}} in order to bypass nationally-based tax and regulatory regimes.

The existing global framework for cooperation on tax affairs is totally inadequate to its task, and the political will to tackle this problem is virtually non-existent as governments acquiesce to pressures from financial capital.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to try to place the debate about Cuno v.

If the first hypothetical were true, the tax incentives offered by Toledo would violate the rules of the World Trade Organization; if the second hypothetical were true, the tax incentives would also violate the Treaty of Rome, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice. The reason for those outcomes is that tax incentives like those at issue in Cuno violate well established policies of both the WTO and the ECJ designed to prevent <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> <b>competition</b> from skewing trade and investment patterns. Thus, consideration of the two hypotheticals may shed some light on the policy issues at stake inCuno, as well as on the desirable outcome if the Supreme Court were to decide Cuno on the merits...|$|E
