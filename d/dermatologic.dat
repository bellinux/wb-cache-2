5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of psoriasis includes dermatological conditions similar in appearance such as discoid eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, pityriasis rosea (may {{be confused with}} guttate psoriasis), nail fungus (may be confused with nail psoriasis) or cutaneous T cell lymphoma (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially misdiagnosed with psoriasis). <b>Dermatologic</b> manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the <b>dermatologic</b> manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent. The {{active ingredient}} in the cleanser and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of benzoyl peroxide, lower than in most prescription-strength acne treatments. Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's <b>Dermatologic</b> Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several <b>dermatologic</b> diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E

25|$|Tele{{dermatology}} {{is a form}} {{of dermatology}} where telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information via all kinds of media (audio, visual and also data communication, but typically photos of <b>dermatologic</b> conditions) usually made by non-dermatologists for evaluation off-site by dermatologists).|$|E
25|$|However, {{patients}} treated with check-point blockade (specifically CTLA-4 blocking antibodies), {{or a combination}} of check-point blocking antibodies, are at high risk of suffering from immune-related adverse events such as <b>dermatologic,</b> gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hepatic autoimmune reactions. These are most likely due to the breadth of the induced T-cell activation when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are administered by injection in the blood stream.|$|E

25|$|Schwartz has {{authored}} several books, {{most recently}} , a leading book on cutaneous oncology currently {{in its second}} edition. He has written or edited 10 monographs, {{and is the author}} of over 250 book chapters, 500 articles, and 200 other publications. Many of these are in the area of <b>dermatologic</b> oncology, where he has had a special interest in epidermal tumors, paraneoplastic syndromes, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. He has published more than 50 full articles on Kaposi’s sarcoma since 1978, including one of the first three reports of KS-AIDS in 1981. He was the first to describe many Kaposi's sarcoma morphologic variants. In 1978 he first described florid cutaneous papillomatosis. In 1981 he discovered and described acral acanthosis nigricans. In 1994 he devised the commonly-accepted classification for acanthosis nigricans.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly have high levels of TNF-α in their blood and in dermatological lesions. In contrast, in vitro assay demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory <b>dermatologic</b> diseases.|$|E

500|$|In a 2004 article {{published}} in Dermatology Online Journal, authors reported on use of the Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and <b>dermatologic</b> techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of triamcinolone acetonide into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an intense pulsed light (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin. They recommended use of the device with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. Lead researcher Kevin C. Smith explained to Skin & Allergy News that the vibrations when delivered {{to the area of}} the patient's mandible can give relief from discomfort by negating feelings of pain from being sent through the sensory system. Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Magic Wand in Chapter 7 [...] "Other <b>Dermatologic</b> Uses of Botulinum Toxin" [...] of the 2006 compilation book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology. They emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within [...] from the injection site.|$|E

2500|$|Ethylenediamine is an {{ingredient}} in the common bronchodilator drug aminophylline, where it serves to solubilize the active ingredient theophylline. [...] Ethylenediamine has also been used in <b>dermatologic</b> preparations, but {{has been removed from}} some because of causing contact dermatitis. [...] When used as a pharmaceutical excipient, after oral administration its bioavailability is about 0.34, due to a substantial first-pass effect. Less than 20% is eliminated by urinal excretion.|$|E
2500|$|Dangerous {{chemicals}} {{can pose}} a chemical hazard in the workplace. There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, <b>dermatologic</b> agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers. Authorities such as regulatory agencies set occupational exposure limits {{to mitigate the}} risk of chemical hazards. [...] An international effort is investigating {{the health effects of}} mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals. This may be particularly important in causing cancer.|$|E
2500|$|For surgery, many <b>dermatologic</b> {{and plastic}} {{surgeons}} first use a freezing solution, usually liquid nitrogen, on a raised mole and then shave it {{away with a}} scalpel. If the surgeon opts for the shaving method, he or she usually also cauterizes the stump. Because a circle is difficult to close with stitches, the incision is usually elliptical or eye-shaped. However, freezing should not be done to a nevus suspected to be a melanoma, as the ice crystals can cause pathological changes called [...] "freezing artifacts" [...] which might interfere with the diagnosis of the melanoma.|$|E
2500|$|Biotinidase {{deficiency}} {{is not due}} to inadequate biotin, {{but rather}} to a deficiency in the enzymes that process it. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. General symptoms include decreased appetite and growth. <b>Dermatologic</b> symptoms include dermatitis, alopecia, and achromotrichia (absence or loss of pigment in the hair). Perosis (a shortening and thickening of bones) {{is seen in the}} skeleton. [...] Fatty liver and kidney syndrome and hepatic steatosis also can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Side effects {{observed}} in fluoxetine-treated persons in clinical trial with an incidence >5% {{and at least}} twice as common in fluoxetine-treated persons compared to those who received a placebo pill include abnormal [...] dreams, abnormal ejaculation, anorexia, anxiety, asthenia, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flu syndrome, impotence, insomnia, decreased libido, nausea, nervousness, pharyngitis, rash, sinusitis, somnolence, sweating, tremor, vasodilatation, and yawning. Fluoxetine is considered the most stimulating of the SSRIs (that is, it is most prone to causing insomnia and agitation). It also appears to be the most prone of the SSRIs for producing <b>dermatologic</b> reactions (e.g. urticaria (hives), rash, itchiness, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{genetics}} encompasses {{many different}} areas, including clinical practice of physicians, genetic counselors, and nutritionists, clinical diagnostic laboratory activities, and {{research into the}} causes and inheritance of genetic disorders. [...] Examples of conditions that fall {{within the scope of}} medical genetics include birth defects and dysmorphology, mental retardation, autism, and mitochondrial disorders, skeletal dysplasia, connective tissue disorders, cancer genetics, teratogens, and prenatal diagnosis. [...] Medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases. [...] Overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge, as recent advances in genetics are revealing etiologies for neurologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, ophthalmologic, renal, psychiatric, and <b>dermatologic</b> conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{common side}} effects are {{diarrhea}} (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop {{taking the drug}} due to side effects. Nervousness, <b>dermatologic</b> reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. As with all antimicrobial agents, pseudomembranous colitis can occur during and up to several weeks after azithromycin therapy. In the past, physicians cautioned women that antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. However, antibiotics, {{with the exception of}} rifampin and rifabutin, do not affect the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. This change in advice comes because to date, no evidence conclusively demonstrates antibiotics (other than rifampicin or rifabutin) affect these contraceptives. [...] Hearing loss has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>dermatologic</b> {{subspecialty}} called Mohs surgery {{focuses on}} the excision of skin cancers using a tissue-sparing technique that allows intraoperative assessment of 100% of the peripheral and deep tumor margins developed in the 1930s by Dr. Frederic E. Mohs. [...] The procedure {{is defined as a}} type of CCPDMA processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive [...] training in both during their residency. [...] Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many will seek additional training either through preceptorships to join the American Society for Mohs Surgery or through formal one- to two-year Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 it {{was used}} by over 2,000 {{physicians}} and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as [...] "chemically and clinically different {{from any of the}} tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available." [...] During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and motor excitement were [...] "effectively reduced." [...] The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and <b>dermatologic</b> problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
