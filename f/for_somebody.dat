It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s a very strange place <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|E
25|$|In June 1990 {{the police}} {{received}} a tip about Pintarić having {{been seen in}} Prosenik Začretski, near Zabok. They talked to Rudolf Belina, owner of a nearby cottage. A couple of days later, he was visited and shot dead by Pintarić, who thought Belina had betrayed him to the authorities. Shortly after that, Pintarić murdered Barbara Šipek's neighbor for having killed one of her chickens. His fifth and final victim was Božo Habek, shot dead on 2 August 1990 simply for asking the already paranoid Pintarić if he was looking <b>for</b> <b>somebody.</b>|$|E
25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

25|$|Rather, the bipedal {{adaptation}} hominines {{had already}} achieved {{was used in}} the savanna. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that Bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait. Humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches, in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch, which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments. Hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived, slept, walked upright, and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas. However, fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to find later, which is also a rare occurrence. The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

500|$|Greek: Economos – the anglicised surname {{derived from}} the Greek oikonomou ("oi" [...] in Greek {{pronounced}} as a long E.) Oikon (English = ēcon) means house in classical Greek. This surname has the same occupational derivation as Spencer but, like the surnames Stewart and Stuart, has a different etymology. The original meaning of oikonomou was a home owner but it evolved to mean estate manager, somebody {{who was responsible for}} all resources on the estate, a steward. Oikonomou was a medieval Eastern Roman title <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> {{who was in charge of}} a project or institution; it is still used by the Greek Orthodox church. Over time the meaning of Oikonomou has evolved from [...] "manager of resources" [...] to [...] "manager of money, a treasurer".|$|E
500|$|Melish engaged Constance Ortmayer {{to design}} the coin.

Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936 that the original [...] "lacked distinction and artistic merit" [...] and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had {{instructed}} the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding {{that under the}} new 1965 constitution Gibbs [...] "no longer ha any executive powers in Rhodesia", and his reserve power to sack them no longer existed. The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign {{in light of his}} impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending Lord Mountbatten to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> [...] "higher up" [...] in the royal family instead. [...] "Not likely", Wilson retorted.|$|E
500|$|Through the {{depiction}} of the polytheism of Ansul, Le Guin suggests that their beliefs make them more tolerant of religious difference. The Alds refer {{to those who do}} not believe in their god as heathens. Memer, however, thinks to herself that [...] "If [...] meant anything, it meant people who don’t know what’s sacred. Are there any such people? 'Heathen' is merely a word <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who knows a different sacredness than you know." [...] Literature scholar Elizabeth Anderson argues that Le Guin's critique is directed more at religious fundamentalism than at monotheism. The Alds' beliefs are more complex than Memer believes: while they despise writing, they value poetry and spoken words, and are moved by Orrec's recitations. While Le Guin criticizes the violence of the Alds, she also depicts the failed violent uprising in a negative light. A diplomatic settlement is ultimately what ends the conflict, though Memer acknowledges her unsatisfied desire for revenge as Iddor and his followers are escorted out of Ansul to be tried for treason.|$|E

As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are looking <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who is new and fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign."

500|$|Connor, {{despite being}} {{the son of}} two [...] "vampires," [...] {{is meant to be}} [...] "human" [...] with {{otherwise}} super powers. Due to this, he wasn’t given the vampire makeup of the series. Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this, considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that the lack of it saved him much time. Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin, and his attire was said to resemble 'Peter Pan' and 'Robin Hood'. He was also wearing, as a trophy, a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell. After he settles in this world, he drops the necklace and is given a more casual set of clothes: jeans, T-shirts, and jackets. The concept behind Connor’s wardrobe was that, unconcerned with this world’s fashion sense, he [...] "just took whatever was available." [...] Yet, one interviewer notices his clothing to be [...] "conservative [...] <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who's never seen an advert". Connor's hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife. Afterward he's given a modern and cleaner look with longer, styled hair. Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style calling it 'David Cassidy hair-do' and feeling it was a 'little bit heavy'.|$|E
