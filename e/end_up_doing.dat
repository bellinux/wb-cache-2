5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

500|$|A {{photo of}} a spider taken by Noel Saltzman is used on the back cover, {{reflecting}} the album's title. The inside sleeve contains the message [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 douglas blvd. louisville, ky. 40205". McMahan confirmed that this message was serious, and said [...] "We did get some responses and we did listen to CDs and tapes. We didn't <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> anything immediately, so that idea of adding someone sort of fell by the wayside." [...] The message [...] "this recording {{is meant to be}} listened to on vinyl" [...] is printed on some CD issues of Spiderland, demonstrating Slint's preference of analog audio devices.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{continues}} to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including Christopher Nolan, Todd Field, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Tim Burton, Michael Mann, and Gaspar Noé. [...] Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, {{as well as his}} use of music, notably Frank Darabont. Paul Thomas Anderson, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stated, [...] "it's so hard to do anything that doesn't owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you're going to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> something that he's probably already done before. It can all seem like we're falling behind whatever he came up with." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these partnerships, PewDiePie {{maintains}} that he conducts very few promotions {{and works with}} few brands. Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it. Things like that can bring me down. But it's not personal; some people just prefer to believe the worst about others at any given time." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Victor has Jack {{kidnapped and}} {{replaced}} by a lookalike, who {{turns out to be}} a Peruvian drug lord named Marco Annicelli, all in order for him to take over Jabot Cosmetics and merge it with Newman, becoming Newman Abbott Enterprises. Meanwhile, Victor and his children discover that Nikki has fallen off the wagon; they convince her to quit drinking again and she and Victor end up reuniting. Jack makes his way back to Genoa City just as Victor learns that Marco is dangerous; he plans on shooting Marco dead in the park, but it is actually Jack who he ends up shooting, who had finally returned to confront him. Jack ends up falling comatose while Victor frantically tries to get rid of Marco, who continues to masquerade around town. When Jack awakens, he reluctantly agrees to help Victor get Marco out of town and back in prison, which they <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> successfully. With the real Jack back in Genoa City, the Newman Abbott merger comes to an end and both companies return to their separate states. Meanwhile, Adam, who had returned to town under the false identity of Gabriel Bingham, had teamed up with Ian (who had escaped prison) to create a computer virus to destroy Newman Enterprises for separate revenge on both their parts; the virus was known as the Paragon project, which later led to the revelation that [...] "Gabriel" [...] is in fact Adam. He agrees to stop Paragon, but Ian makes no such promise; on Halloween, when a party was being thrown in the Newman Enterprises ballroom, Ian is responsible for the building catching fire and a great panic ensuing. As a result, Ashley and Billy (Burgess Jenkins) offer to share office space at Jabot with Newman while the Newman building is being repaired, but Victor refuses to trust them. It is later revealed that Billy revived Paragon as an act of revenge against Victor, leading to Jack firing him and Victor filing a lawsuit against Jabot.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{short-lived}} disco boom in Detroit, {{it had the}} effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing, Juan Atkins among them. Subsequently, Atkins taught May how to mix records, and in 1981, [...] "Magic Juan", Derrick [...] "Mayday", in conjunction with three other DJ's, one of whom was Eddie [...] "Flashin" [...] Fowlkes, launched themselves as a party crew called Deep Space Soundworks (also referred to as Deep Space). In 1980 or 1981 they met with Mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show, which they did <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{scheduling}} {{conflicts with}} other projects (Moore {{had to travel}} to different places such as London or New York, and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks), they did not necessarily record dialogue {{in the same order}} as in the final film. [...] ", maybe that sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy (Moore) already, maybe it hadn't. We'd <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> the same scene five times, depending," [...] Levi said. After watching the finished film, Moore was disappointed because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill", while Levi thought that his performance sounded [...] "incredibly nasally".|$|E

2500|$|Historians {{have been}} divided {{as to whether}} Heisenberg and his team were {{sincerely}} trying to construct a nuclear weapon, or whether their failure reflected a desire not to succeed {{because they did not}} want the Nazi regime to have such a weapon. This latter view, largely based on postwar interviews with Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, was put forward by Robert Jungk in his 1957 book Brighter Than a Thousand Suns. In a 1957 interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel, Weizsäcker frankly admitted to the scientific ambitions of those years [...] "We wanted to know if chain reactions were possible. No matter what we would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> with our knowledge– we wanted to know." [...] Only by [...] "divine grace", Weizsäcker said, were they spared the temptation to build the bomb— grace, as the German war economy was unable to mobilize the necessary resources.|$|E
2500|$|Although Grande drew {{criticism}} for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed these reports as [...] "weird, inaccurate depictions". After considering the incidents most frequently {{mentioned in the}} press and the available evidence, PopSugar concluded that the incidents were [...] "just normal star behavior" [...] and [...] "not the most ideal situation, but ... not exactly the sign of a diva". Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image." [...] In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying [...] "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She apologized, writing that she is [...] "extremely proud to be an American" [...] and that her comments related to American obesity. She later released a video apology for [...] "behaving poorly". The incident was parodied by The Muppets and featured in Miley Cyrus' Saturday Night Live cover of [...] "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande mocked the incident herself on Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying [...] "A lot of kid stars <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught looking at a doughnut they didn't pay for." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm going to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; {{in an interview with}} MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song.

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

[...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

As a result, Adams <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>doing</b> covers for all of Christie’s paperbacks, often more than once. PocketBooks in the US very much wanted more realistic covers. For this reason, Adams’s covers for the US editions usually feature a single dramatic or portentous scene from the novel. Fontana in the UK was much more open to Adams’s creative input. Thus, the UK covers were often akin to a stylized tableau or surrealist collage.
