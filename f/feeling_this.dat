5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and <b>feeling.</b> <b>This</b> was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E

Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to walk past the camera and continue off-screen. <b>Feeling</b> <b>this</b> was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick will jump in front of a truck if he think it will make a scene better".|$|E

[...] This was an [...] "enormous fight" [...] between Moore and the network, with the latter <b>feeling</b> <b>this</b> was another scene that was [...] "too dark" [...] and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order.

500|$|In April 2013, Cielo {{confirmed}} {{his place in}} the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, in Barcelona, in the 50-metre freestyle, with the second best time {{in the world of the}} year: 21.57 seconds. He also qualified for the 50-metre butterfly. Due to his operation in both knees, Cielo did not compete in the 100-metre freestyle and the Brazilian relays. In the competition, Cielo became two-time World Champion of the 50-metre butterfly. The semifinals were the strongest stage of the race, with five swimmers earning times below 23 seconds. Cielo went to the final in second place with a time of 22.86 seconds, behind his compatriot Nicholas Santos. In the final, the athletes' performance was not the same, but Cielo showed more consistency and won the gold with a time of 23.01 seconds. In the 50-metre freestyle, Cielo reached the final with the third fastest time, 21.60 seconds, tied with Nathan Adrian. Florent Manaudou and Anthony Ervin qualified for the final as favorites, with strong times of 21.37 and 21.42 seconds respectively, in the second semifinal. But, in a final with a high technical level in which three Olympic champions (Manaudou, Cielo and Ervin) were competing, Cielo earned the best time of his life without a high-tech suit (and an unofficial world fastest time swum in textile), 21.32 seconds, becoming the first three-time World Champion of the event. Manaudou and Ervin did not even reach the podium. It was Cielo's sixth gold medal in individual events at the World Championships. With this result, Cielo overcame Alexander Popov and became the sprinter with more individual golds in World Championship history. Only four male swimmers have won more gold individual medals in World Championships than Cielo: Aaron Peirsol (7), Grant Hackett (7), Ryan Lochte (9) and Michael Phelps (15). Regarding his gold medal in the 50-metre freestyle, Cielo assured his fans that it was the most important gold of his career, declaring at the World Championships: [...] "It was certainly different from all others. Each medal has a different <b>feeling.</b> <b>This</b> was the most special of my life. From London, all I had to overcome... it was very exciting". Cielo's results were considered a [...] "redemption", because of low expectations entering the 2013 World Championships due to the troubled period following the London Olympics, when he underwent surgery on both knees, left his club and changed his coach.|$|E
