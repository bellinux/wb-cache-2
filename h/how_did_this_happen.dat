The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study 1 is a major American research project that poses the {{question of}} whether, and how, childhood experiences affect adult health decades later. This question is being answered with the ongoing collaboration of Robert Anda, MD at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the cooperation of 17, 421 adults at Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego, California. Kaiser Permanente is a multispecialty, prepaid, private health insurance system or Health Maintenance Organization [HMO].

The question I would like to address in <b>this</b> paper is <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen?</b> In particular, what is the mechanism? In {{the absence of a}} deep understanding of the process by which people come to have similar ideas, a variety of metaphors have been used.

I conclude with a view which I hope is an advance over the existing alternatives. My proposal makes clearer the role of artefacts in mediating many kinds of communication, and takes account of the recent evolution of evolutionary technology – networks of machines which exhibit the qualities of information inheritance, selection and mutation – as an important phenomenon that interacts with cultural change. Communication is the process of exchanging information via a common system of symbols, signs or behaviour (Merriam-Webster dictionary; Encyclopedia Britannica).

In the implicit treatment, subjects do not see the average contribution of others in their group, but they can calculate it from the information available. In the explicit treatment, subjects see the average contribution of others in their group. If subjects are rational calculating agents as suggested in mainstream economic theory there should be no difference in observed behavior across treatments: agents should use all available information to make decisions. What we see instead is quite different and consistent with the presence of social norms: first, players change their behavior in response to the change in displayed information; second, changes in individual behavior produce identical group outcomes, in terms of total payoffs or efficiency across the two treatments. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen?</b> The display of the average contribution of others results in behavior consistent with a focal point (Schelling, 1960), i. e., more subjects behave as reciprocators (conditioning their contributions on the contributions of others), and fewer behave as cooperators or free-riders (unconditionally contributing a lot or a little, respectively). This change in behavior differs by gender: women behave similarly to men when they see the average contribution by others; when they cannot, they behave differently, favoring unconditional strategies of free-riding or cooperation.
