Samples were collected between April 2014 and April 2015, during new moon with longline and <b>falling</b> <b>gear.</b> In total, 130 specimens were captured of T. galeatus, 66 males (50. 77 %) and 64 females (49. 23 %). Largest individual already {{reported in the}} literature was found. Males were larger and heavier than females. The sex ratio was one male for each female. The higher frequency of T. galeatus was rainy season, and the females who obtained the highest absolute and relative frequencies to the class 9 - 12 (cm). In morphometric relationships, all correlations were allometric negative. Highest frequencies occurred in the rainy season, when males and females were mature, exhausted ou in rest.

After that they trimmed her fore-staysail over, and there was by contrast a curious quietness as Dampier jammed his helm up, and the schooner swung off before the sea. Then somebody lighted a lantern, and Charly stooped over Wyllard, who lay limp and still beside the wheel. His face showed grey in the feeble light, save where a broad red stain had spread across it. Dampier cast a glance at him.|$|R

We are introduced to the [...] "other side" [...] {{of the life of}} humans faced by total annihilation. Birthing Creches, or Breeding Farms, filled with women who are there to just have baby after baby, and nothing else. With humanity dying out and no fresh faces to replace <b>fallen</b> <b>Gears,</b> new humans are needed. The story focuses on an escapee from one of these centers named Alex Brand. Declared to be barren at the age of 18, Brand was kicked from the Breeding Farm she was born in, sent to Boot Camp and trained to be a Gear. She accompanies Delta and Sigma Squads as they investigate a mysterious beacon call from the place at which she was born, which was thought to have been destroyed by Locust.|$|R

40|$|Primate {{ecological}} {{studies can}} benefit from accessing the canopy to estimate intra-tree and inter-tree variation in food availability and nutrient value, patch and subpatch depletion, foraging efficiency, as well as nest structure and nest-ing behaviors, parasitic transmission and predator detectability. We compare several ways to access the canopy and examine their suitability for studies of primates. Two of them—the Single Rope Technique and the Climbing Spur Method—allow people to safely access almost all kinds of trees, regardless of their size, height or shape. Modern climbing gear and contemporaneous safety protocols, derived from rock climbers, speleologists, and industrial arborists, are reliable and appropriate for primate ecological studies. Climbing gear is specialized and still expensive for students, but tree climbing can be dangerous during specific maneuvres. Consequently, formal training and preliminary ex-perience are essential before attempting to collect data. We discuss the physics of falling, risk assessment associated with a <b>fall,</b> knots, <b>gear</b> and safety pre-cautions. Finally, we propose a Tree Climbing Safety Protocol adapted fo...|$|R
5000|$|The term gear in {{climbing}} generally {{refers to}} equipment used during climbs (except harness, shoes, chalk bags, and chalk). Gear or protection are mechanical devices that provide safety, either by allowing greater stability {{in making a}} move (as {{in the case of}} aid climbing) or by dampening force and reducing the distance of a fall. The suitability of individual types of gear depends on the surface and formation of the rock face. The phrase placing gear denotes the act of setting a piece of gear into the rock face and then attaching the rope (via carabiner) before ascending higher. In the event of a <b>fall,</b> the <b>gear</b> acts as a catch-point for the rope, thus preventing the climber from hurtling to the ground. Being [...] "run out" [...] refers to the situation where the distance from the climber's position to the last piece of gear is far enough that the climber will receive little, if any, protection from a fall.|$|R

To better prepare our students for this emerging trend in software development, material on web services and service-oriented architecture should {{become more of}} a focus in computer science courses. This paper describes our experiences in teaching a senior-level course at the University of Virginia in the <b>fall</b> of 2009 <b>geared</b> around the concepts of web services and service-oriented architecture using the Windows Mobile platform. In this course, students worked in teams to produce web services that could be utilized by other teams to eventually build a campus tour application for the Windows Mobile device. We believe that using mobile devices is an optimal vehicle for teaching service-oriented architecture due to their relatively limited processing power, portability, pervasiveness in society, and interest among students...|$|R
50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} when the landing gear was lowered, a loud thump was heard. That unusual sound was accompanied by abnormal vibration and yaw of the aircraft. The right main landing gear retract cylinder assembly had failed due to corrosion, and that allowed the right <b>gear</b> to free <b>fall.</b> Although it was down and locked, the rapid and abnormal free <b>fall</b> of the <b>gear</b> damaged a microswitch so severely that it failed to complete the circuit to the cockpit green light that tells the pilots that gear is down and locked. Those unusual indications (loud noise, vibration, yaw, and no green light) led the captain to abort the landing, {{so that they would}} have time to diagnose the problem and prepare the passengers for an emergency landing. While the decision to abort the landing was prudent, the accident occurred because the flight crew became so absorbed with diagnosing the problem that they failed to monitor their fuel state and calculate a time when they needed to return to land or risk fuel exhaustion.|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the EU minimum standard on cold appliances: the British case Monitoring the effectiveness of policy {{is an essential part of}} securing energy savings. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the minimum standard on cold appliances using the British market as a case study. Data availability on developments in the cold appliance market in Britain is very good compared to most other EU markets, permitting an unbroken quarterly analysis from 1995 onwards. The timing and magnitude of market transformation as a result of the minimum standard is shown in the context of historical rates of change, the aspirations of Directive 96 / 57 /EC and the development in price. The analysis shows that the minimum standard is resulting in substantial energy savings to the consumer, but that retailers and manufacturers delayed efficiency improvements to the UK market for as long as possible. More than one year after the standard came into effect a significant proportion of sales were not meeting the standard. There is very little evidence that the minimum standard has resulted in price increases. On the contrary, real prices generally continued to <b>fall</b> as manufacturers <b>geared</b> up to meeting the standard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gear honing {{processing}} {{is a kind}} {{of processing}} method which belongs to the point-contact generating gear finishing. Its movement form is equivalent to a pair of gears transmission which the surface of the gear-honing-tool is adhered a layer of grinding grain. When it works in rolling processing, the contact-point between the workpiece and gear-honing-tool is moving. Then the moving point becomes a line in the space, and with the gear-honing-tool being in axial play, a standard flank of tooth is finished. Using the gear meshing principle, kinematics model of relative sliding velocity in the contact- point between the workpiece and tools is established, based on which the contact-line equation. and acceleration equation. at the contact-point are derived. The contact-line is solved in a given parameters of the workpiece and tool in MATLAB. The theoretical derivation and experimental results show that the speed in diverse along the direction of the tooth depth is the main reason for the roughness value and surface texture of workpiece. The acceleration of contact-line at the tooth flank is different, and it is leading reason that the processed workpiece gears appear profile distortion. Finally, the testing system is established for researching honing gear process. It is showed in the results that the acceleration difference can lead to the CBN abrasive <b>falling</b> away from <b>gear</b> honing tool, and even the "anti-cutting " phenomenon...|$|R
60|$|Some {{of these}} {{fighting}} airships came within five hundred {{feet of the}} ground. Bert could see men on the lower galleries of the Germans, firing rifles; could see Asiatics clinging to the ropes; saw one man in aluminium diver's <b>gear</b> <b>fall</b> flashing headlong into the waters above Goat Island. For {{the first time he}} saw the Asiatic airships closely. From this aspect they reminded him more than anything else of colossal snowshoes; they had a curious patterning in black and white, in forms that reminded him of the engine-turned cover of a watch. They had no hanging galleries, but from little openings on the middle line peeped out men and the muzzles of guns. So, driving in long, descending and ascending curves, these monsters wrestled and fought. It was like clouds fighting, like puddings trying to assassinate each other. They whirled and circled about each other, and for a time threw Goat Island and Niagara into a smoky twilight, through which the sunlight smote in shafts and beams. They spread and closed and spread and grappled and drove round over the rapids, and two miles away or more into Canada, and back over the Falls again. A German caught fire, and the whole crowd broke away from her flare and rose about her dispersing, leaving her to drop towards Canada and blow up as she dropped. Then with renewed uproar the others closed again. Once from the men in Niagara city came a sound like an ant-hill cheering. Another German burnt, and one badly deflated by the prow of an antagonist, flopped out of action southward.|$|R
40|$|Modelling two {{recommendations}} {{made in the}} Henry Review of Taxation (2010), {{this study}} considers {{the impact of the}} recommendations on rents, rental supply and housing affordability. The Henry Review recommended two key changes to taxation arrangements to promote more balanced investment in private rental accommodation and improve housing affordability: Recommendations 14 - 15 are directed at reducing the net benefit of negative gearing for rental investors by introducing a Savings Income Discount (SID) of 40 per cent for net rental income (including capital gains) from non-business assets. Recommendations 51 - 54 involve the removal of stamp duties and levying of land tax on a per land holding basis. &​nbsp; The study uses the AHURI- 3 M micro-simulation model to simulate the recommended changes. In the first report, the study authors found that negatively geared investors are adversely affected by the SID reforms with their average after-tax economic cost rising by 50 basis points from 8. 0 to 8. 5 per cent. &​nbsp; However the average after-tax economic cost for equity investors (i. e. those not negatively <b>geared)</b> <b>falls</b> by 50 basis points to 7. 5 per cent. &​nbsp; It is predicted that these lower costs flow through into long-term average annual rents, which would fall by just over $ 300. &​nbsp; Most of the benefit is predicted to go to those in the more expensive part of the rental market. &​nbsp; Other modelling suggests that unleveraged and equity oriented investors are more inclined to retain investments under the SID reforms while negatively geared investors {{would be more likely to}} realise their investments. &​nbsp; Because these supply responses would offset each other, a &# 039;flight of investors&# 039; from private rental housing seems unlikely...|$|R
40|$|Overexploitation of bycatch {{and target}} species in marine capture {{fisheries}} {{is the most}} widespread and direct driver of change and loss of global marine biodiversity. Bycatch in purse seine and pelagic longline tuna fisheries, the two primary gear types for catching tunas, is a primary mortality source of some populations of seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and sharks. Bycatch of juvenile tunas and unmarketable species and sizes of other fish in purse seine fisheries, and juvenile swordfish in longline fisheries, contributes to the overexploitation of some stocks, and is an allocation issue. There has been substantial progress in identifying gear technology solutions to seabird and sea turtle bycatch on longlines and to direct dolphin mortality in purse seines. Given sufficient investment, gear technology solutions are probably feasible for the remaining bycatch problems. More comprehensive consideration across species groups is needed to identify conflicts as well as mutual benefits from mitigation methods. Fishery-specific bycatch assessments are necessary to determine the efficacy, economic viability, practicality and safety of alternative mitigation methods. While support for gear technology research and development has generally been strong, political will to achieve broad uptake of best practices has been lacking. The five Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have achieved mixed progress mitigating bycatch. Large gaps remain in both knowledge of ecological risks and governance of bycatch. Most binding conservation and management measures <b>fall</b> short of <b>gear</b> technology best practice. A lack of performance standards, in combination with an inadequate observer coverage for all but large Pacific purse seiners, and incomplete data collection, hinders assessing measures' efficacy. Compliance is probably low due to inadequate surveillance and enforcement. Illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna fishing hampers governance efforts. Replacing consensus-based decision-making and eliminating opt-out provisions would help. Instituting rights-based management measures could elicit improved bycatch mitigation practices. While gradual improvements in an international governance of bycatch can be expected, market-based mechanisms, including retailers and their suppliers working with fisheries to gradually improve practices and governance, promise to be expeditious and effective.
