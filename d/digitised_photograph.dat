40|$|Throughout {{the human}} population, there is {{remarkable}} agreement {{as to what}} constitutes an attractive face. The consistency of attractiveness ratings across age, gender and culture {{has led to a}} search for an underlying construct that determines facial attractiveness. Langlois and Roggman (1990) proposed the 2 ̆ 2 average is attractive 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis arguing that facial attractiveness is determined by the level of averageness of facial features. Langlois and Roggman (1990) created composite faces to examine this hypothesis but their methodology was criticised, particularly because the technique used to create the composites tended to remove facial flaws and blemishes. This led to the argument that the increased attractiveness of the composite faces {{was the result of the}} smoothing of the faces rather than from their increased averageness.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} are reported that investigate {{the hypothesis that}} head orientation and gaze direction interact in the processing of another individual’s direction of social attention. A Stroop-type interference paradigm was adopted in which gaze and head cues were placed into conflict. In separate blocks of trials, {{participants were asked to}} make speeded keypress responses contingent on either the direction of gaze, or the orientation of the head displayed in a <b>digitised</b> <b>photograph</b> of a male face. In Experiments 1 and 2 head and gaze cues showed symmetrical interference effects. Compared with congruent arrangements, incongruent head cues slowed responses to gaze cues, and incongruent gaze cues slowed responses to head cues, suggesting that head and gaze are mutually influential in the analysis of social attention direction. This mutuality was also evident in a cross-modal version of the task (Experiment 3) where participants responded to spoken directional words whilst ignoring the head/gaze images. It is argued that these interference effects arise from the independent influences of gaze and head orientation on decisions concerning social attention direction. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe psychophysical task of discriminating {{changes in}} {{the slopes of the}} {{amplitude}} spectra of complex images has been used in the past to test whether the human visual system might be optimised for coding the spatial structure in natural images (e. g. Knill et al., 1990; Tadmor & Tolhurst, 1994). We have reported that the dependency of these discrimination thresholds on the reference slope has the same overall general form, regardless of the particular <b>digitised</b> <b>photographs</b> that are used for generating the stimuli. The actual discrimination thresholds, however, differ markedly in magnitude for stimuli that are derived from different <b>digitised</b> <b>photographs.</b> Here, we describe a model that aims at explaining this diversity of threshold magnitudes: we suppose that the observer is detecting small changes in image contrast estimated within limited spatial-frequency bands of about 1 octave bandwidth. This local-contrast analysis reveals that contrast changes in only one frequency band are of comparable magnitudes to the changes that observers need for detecting differences in the Michelson contrast of simple sinusoidal gratings. The success of this band-limited contrast model is further shown in experiments where the slopes of the amplitude spectra of stimuli were changed only within restricted frequency bands. We show that when the slope is changed outside the limited frequency band implicated by the contrast model, the observer's thresholds are greatly elevated. Thresholds remain unchanged when slope changes are made within the implicated band. We also find that the exact bandwidth of the contrast operator is not critical, provided that it is in the range of about 0. 6 – 1. 5, which is the characteristic bandwidth range of V 1 neurons...|$|R

40|$|Multimedia {{has been}} quickly {{accepted}} by the engineering community. In {{the first part of}} the paper, the author provides a theoretical explanation why multimedia is popular in engineering: because it tries to provide an artificial “being-in-the-world” experience. This explanation is backed-up by Heidegger's philosophy and Winogard's critique of artificial intelligence (AI). Heidegger believed that humans basically act pre-reflectively, depending on the situation into which they are thrown. Such decisions are based on common sense and intuitive knowledge accumulated while “being-in-the-world”, and particularly during breakdowns. Engineering students have few opportunities to observe breakdowns, however, information technology, particularly virtual reality and multimedia provide them. In the second part of the paper, a system to teach earthquake engineering is presented, based on the principles of breakdown-oriented learning. The system is built around a multimedia database that contains <b>digitised</b> <b>photographs</b> of damages caused by some of the recent major earthquakes. To a large extent, such multimedia tools can replace the learning from real breakdowns and complements theoretical knowledge that can be passed on using traditional means. ...|$|R

METHODS [...] Nineteen patients admitted for routine cataract extraction were examined clinically by two independent observers to ascertain cataract type and clarity of fundus view with an indirect ophthalmoscope. Fundus photography and both confocal and direct (non-confocal) SLO imaging at 590 nm, 670 nm, and 830 nm were carried out after pupillary dilatation. Images obtained were graded independently using a recognised grading system. RESULTS [...] Quality of SLO images appeared to be superior to indirect ophthalmoscopy (p < 0. 01) and fundus photography (p < 0. 001) when graded subjectively. Quantitative analysis of contrast of retinal vessels demonstrated significantly higher contrast for the SLO compared with <b>digitised</b> fundus <b>photographs</b> at all wavelengths tested (p < 0. 001), with highest contrast at 590 nm.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. In the late 1950 s Peter Townsend undertook a national study which investigated the provision of long-stay institutional care for old people in England and Wales. His findings and recommendations were published in 1962 in his book The Last Refuge. The study sought to ask "Are long stay institutions for old people necessary in our society, and, if so, what form should they take?" Interviews were conducted with local authority chief welfare officers; and over one hundred institutions - local authority, voluntary and private - were visited and interviews made with their matrons, wardens and proprietors; as well as residents. In many cases, detailed notes were also made {{about the condition of}} the buildings and the facilities that were offered. The study was conducted in 5 distinct stages: Pilot 1 - Peter Townsend's first visit to a old people's home (2 field notes) Pilot 2 - Pilot visits/interviews with Welfare Officers and at homes for the elderly in Hampshire (9 field notes; 3 interview summaries) Pilot 3 - Pilot visits/interviews in homes for the elderly in London (7 field notes) Welfare Officer Interviews - Interviews with Welfare Officers (61 interview summaries) Home Interviews - Interviews with matrons, superintendents or proprietors of homes for the elderly (4 field notes; 130 interview summaries) The data collection also includes 112 digitized photographs taken at the care institutions by Townsend during the fieldwork. The photographs complement the stories told in the interview summaries and field notes. Metadata has been added in the property of each photograph, including id, name of the collection, author, annotations, and a description of the photograph. The data collection which is available from ESDS Qualidata has been digitisation for download. A teaching resource has been created which can be used alongside this data collection - Re-using qualitative data - The Last Refuge. The resource has activities {{that can be used in}} the classroom or as self-paced learning activities. The aim is to think critically about the project's methodology and information provided by the data and what kinds of opportunities and challenges these might present for re-use of that data.

40|$|A memory based expert system(JANUS) {{has been}} {{designed}} to interpret facial expression in terms of the signalled emotion. Janus accepts a geometric description of the face obtained from measurements on a <b>digitised</b> full face <b>photograph</b> and returns the appropriate emotion label. An intermediate representation in terms of verbal face actions(eg.. mouth open,eyes closed) is also used. A production rule system converts the geometric description to verbal form, while a dynamic memory interprets the face actions in terms of emotions. Following the work of Schank(1982) and Kolodner (1984),the dynamic memory is structured as a tree of packets, storing, in Janus, typical facial expressions connected by links to atypical but related face expressions previously encountered. This enables new input to be channelled along the appropriate path to an interpretation based on previous experience. The system is capable of learning new emotion labels and associated face actions for use in subsequent interpretations. A prototype system has been developed on a SUN 2 /MJN/ 120 system using POPLOG.

40|$|Glacial lake {{outburst}} floods {{have produced}} a distinctive and widespread Quaternary record both onshore and offshore via widespread and intense geomorphological impacts, yet these impacts remain poorly understood {{due to a lack}} of modern analogues. This study therefore makes a systematic quantification of the evolution of a bedrock-channelled outburst flood. Channel topography was obtained from <b>digitised</b> aerial <b>photographs,</b> a 5 m grid resolution DEM and bathymetric surveys. Flood inundation was measured in the field from dGPS measurements. Flood evolution was analysed with application of a numerical model. Novel flood metrics, including 'rate-of-rise-to-peak' and 'persistence-above-a-value' of hydraulics were calculated. The key findings were that outburst floods; (i) that enter intermediary lakes are dramatically attenuated in terms of propagation whilst basin filling proceeds to the outlet level, dissipated of energy due to considerable flow recirculation during the rising stage of the flood, and after overtopping of the outlet are moderated in terms of peak discharge; (ii) can have kinematic waves that are introduced to a flood via hydraulic ponding, (iii) may develop a partitioning of flow regimes for instantaneous peak discharge, bed shear stress and Froude number due to time-transgressive changes in channel cross-section; specifically between inner channel and overbank regions. Furthermore, normalised change in cross-sectional area and normalised change in channel slope can be used to suggest the relative magnitude of instantaneous peak discharge. Net erosion along a reach can be related to hydraulic persistence above a marker value and net deposition can be related to a 'time to peak' value. Reconstructions of Quaternary outburst floods should consider the importance of including intermediary lakes. Modern hazard mitigation studies could usefully note the potential use of reservoirs as an outburst flood alleviation resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the morphodynamics of tidal channel {{networks}} is important because of their role in tidal propagation {{and the evolution of}} salt-marshes and tidal flats. Channel dimensions range from tens of metres wide and metres deep near the low water mark to only 20 - 30 cm wide and 20 cm deep for the smallest channels on the marshes. The conventional method of measuring the networks is cumbersome, involving manual <b>digitising</b> of aerial <b>photographs.</b> This paper describes a semi-automatic knowledge-based network extraction method that is being implemented to work using airborne scanning laser altimetry (and later aerial photography). The channels exhibit a width variation of several orders of magnitude, making an approach based on multi-scale line detection difficult. The processing therefore uses multi-scale edge detection to detect channel edges, then associates adjacent anti-parallel edges together to form channels using a distance-with-destination transform. Breaks in the networks are repaired by extending channel ends in the direction of their ends to join with nearby channels, using domain knowledge that flow paths should proceed downhill and that any network fragment should be joined to a nearby fragment so as to connect eventually to the open sea...|$|R
40|$|Ground based forest {{inventory}} surveys can provide highly accurate measurements of tree and stand characteristics, but are time-consuming and costly, and therefore typically limited to number of sample plots.   Estimating tree and stand characteristics from <b>digitised</b> aerial <b>photographs</b> can provide measurements {{from the whole}} stand, but is less accurate.   The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the application of scanned, stereo aerial photography and digital photogrammetry in combination with tree crown delineation techniques to measure tree and stand characteristics in two sites in Scotland, Rosarie and Leanachan forests.   Existing medium-resolution scanned images of true colour aerial photographs (1 : 10, 000) were used to derive Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the forest canopy and digital orthophotographs.   Tree crown delineation techniques were used on the derived digital orthophotographs and tree crown measurements including crown area and coordinates of each crown were derived.   The DEMs in combination with Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived from digital contour maps, were used for the estimation of tree and stand heights.   Equations derived from regression analysis of individual tree measurements on the ground, and the orthophotographs from Rosarie forest, were used for the estimation of tree and stand characteristics of both sites. For Rosarie forest the estimations of stand top height, basal area, stand volume stand biomass and stand density (~ 23. 7 %) were similar with the ground measured stand characteristics (± 10 %), where as for Leanachan forest the estimations were less accurate due to the non-optimum illumination conditions during the acquisition of the aerial photographs. The level of accuracy achieved in this study is adequate for measuring tree and stand characteristics, if the acquisition conditions of aerial photographs are optimal.   Higher level of accuracy may be possible, but requires more accurate DTMs, possibly derived using active airborne remote sensing sensors.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that agricultural intensification has lead to simplification of landscape structure, {{but it has}} not been clarified if this is a ubiquitous relationship. That is, it has been an open question whether agricultural intensity and landscape simplicity should be regarded as one single or as two separate dimensions. To evaluate this we analysed landscape data in 136 different 1 km x 1 km study sites and within a buffer zone of 2 kill around each site (i. e. approximately 5 km x 5 km). The sites were distributed over {{a large part of the}} region of Scania, southernmost Sweden, an area dominated by agriculture but With large variation in both intensity and complexity. We used spatially explicit digital data on land use, <b>digitised</b> aerial <b>photographs,</b> field surveys of landscape elements and agricultural statistics. Two separate factor analyses, one for each scale of measurements (1 km and 5 km), suggest that there are five and three relevant factors for each scale respectively. At the 1 km scale, the first factor can be interpreted as describing the intensity of land use in the form of proportion arable land which is highly correlated to crop yield. The second and third factors are more connected to landscape structure and amount of small patches of semi-natural habitats. The fourth and fifth factors contain one major variable each: proportion pasture and leys respectively. The division of intensity and complexity related variables is less clear at a larger spatial scale. At the 5 km scale, factor I is defined almost identically as at the 1 km scale. However, factors 2 and 3 are interpreted as descriptors of dairy and livestock farming systems but also include structural variables. Our analyses suggest that land use intensity and structural complexity of landscapes are more or less separate landscape level factors, at least at smaller spatial scales. This is important to bear in mind, especially when trying to explain patterns of biodiversity change in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} several {{techniques}} for {{the elaboration of}} landslides databases are compared. The used techniques are the digitising on ortophotographies, the <b>digitising</b> on aerial <b>photographs</b> and geometrical correction, and, finally, the stereoplotting using digital photogrammetry. The landslide scarps databases derived from the different methodologies have been compared by several indexes such as the displacement between crown lines of scarps, the lengths of scarps, and the adjustment of scarps to a DTM. The analysis shows lower or higher discrepancies between the databases, with displacements between 8 and 45 meters, depending on the compared methodologies and landslides typologies. The best results are obtained with the methodology of digital stereoplotting whose scarps database is well adjusted to the DTM. Among the rest of methodologies, the digitising on orthophotography presents the lower differences with the previous one, while the methodology of the digitising on photogram presents the worst results, with a certain spatial pattern related with the relief displacement. The conclusion is to recommend {{the use of the}} digital stereoplotting to elaborate landslides databases and as possible alternatives the digitising on ortophotography (especially if they are derived from the stereoscopic pairs used in the interpretation), being dissuaded the digitising on the photogram, at least in zones with a strong relief. 1...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—Quantification of retinal {{vascular}} {{change is}} difficult and manual measurements of vascular features are slow and subject to observer bias. These problems may be overcome using computer algorithms. Three automated methods and a manual method for measurement of arteriolar diameters from <b>digitised</b> red-free retinal <b>photographs</b> were compared.  METHODS— 60 diameters (in pixels) measured by manual identification of vessel edges in red-free retinal images were compared with diameters measured by (1) fitting vessel intensity profiles to a double Gaussian function by non-linear regression, (2) a standard edge detection algorithm (Sobel), and (3) determination of points of maximum intensity variation by a sliding linear regression filter (SLRF). Method agreement was analysed using Bland-Altman plots and the repeatability of each method was assessed.  RESULTS—Diameter estimations obtained using the SLRF method were the least scattered although diameters obtained were approximately 3  pixels greater than those measured manually. The SLRF method was the most repeatable and the Gaussian method less so. The Sobel method was the least consistent owing to frequent misinterpretation of the light reflex as the vessel edge.  CONCLUSION—Of the three automated methods compared, the SLRF method was the most consistent (defined as the method producing diameter estimations with the least scatter) and the most repeatable in measurements of retinal arteriolar diameter. Application of automated methods of retinal vascular analysis {{may be useful in}} the assessment of cardiovascular and other diseases. ...|$|R
40|$|Cliffs {{are common}} around {{the shores of}} Tauranga Harbour, {{including}} in the urban areas.

To identify the relative risk around the harbour shoreline, {{it is useful to}} determine the rates and patterns of shoreline erosion. This study initially determined the shoreline changes between 1943, 1982 and 2011 using a combination of aerial photograph analysis using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), airborne LiDAR data and Laser scan data. Long term rate of retreat was determined for the study area with the use of <b>digitised</b> aerial <b>photographs</b> and DSAS applications. Cliff locations are often difficult to determine from aerial photographs due to shadows and vegetation obscuring the ground surface. Hence, LiDAR data were used to initially identify the cliff edge positions in 2011. These results were compared to the 2011 aerial photograph to assess how easily the cliff edge can be identified with the photographs. The inferred cliff edge from the 2011 aerial <b>photograph</b> was <b>digitised</b> in GIS, and the corresponding cliff edge for 1943 was also determined and digitised using stereopairs to aid cliff edge identification. The 1982 aerial photograph was scanned, georeferenced and shoreline digitised. Using the DSAS software, the rates were computed. However, this was also compared to other methods using the intersection points generated from DSAS. Laser scan surveys were conducted to determine surface volume changes to acquire short term rate of retreat at the cliff face. This analysis involved surveys carried out within a period from May 2014, July 2014 – November 2014. The data collected was compared to earlier laser scan data from September 2012 – July 2013 and LiDAR data from September 2011. Several approaches were used to determine the best estimate of rate of retreat from the DSAS analyses. It was identified that the buffer end-point rate produced the best rate cliff retreat in the study area. The range of rate of retreat using this method was - 0. 2 ± 0. 16 to 0. 07 ± 0. 16 m. y- 1. It was also identified that the Matua Subgroup had the highest rate of erosion within the study area located at South west Matakana Island. The rate was lowest at East Pahoia Peninsula. Although laser scans were conducted only over a short period of time, comparing the dataset to earlier laser scan data a range of rates were obtained - 0. 01 to 0. 02 m. y- 1. Although rates were determined for both methods the errors were large and need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{beauty of}} a landscape is a very subjective issue: every person has their own opinions and their own idea of what beauty is. However, all people have a common evolutionary history, and, according to the Biophilia hypothesis, a genetic predisposition to liking certain types of landscapes. It is possible that this common inheritance allows us to attempt to model scenic preference for natural landscapes. The ideal type of model for such predictions is the psychophysical preference model, integrating psychological responses to landscapes with objective measurements of quantitative and qualitative landscape variables. Such models commonly predict {{two thirds of the}} variance in the predications of the general public for natural landscapes. In order to create such a model three sets of data were required: landscape photographs (surrogates of the actual landscape), landscape preference data and landscape component variable measurements. The Internet was used to run a questionnaire survey; a novel, yet flexible, environmentally friendly and simple method of data gathering, resulting in one hundred and eighty responses. A geographic information system was used to <b>digitise</b> ninety landscape <b>photographs</b> and measure their landforms (based on elevation) in terms of areas and perimeters, their colours and proxies for their complexity and coherence. Landscape preference models were created by running multiple linear regressions using normalised preference data and the landscape component variables, including mathematical transformations of these variables. The eight models created predicted over sixty percent of variance in the responses and had moderate to high correlations with a second set of landscape preference data. A common base to the models were the variables of complexity, water and mountain landform, in particular the presence or absence of water and mountains was noted as being significant in determining landscape scenic preference. In order to fully establish the utility of these models, they were further tested against: changes in weather and season; the addition of cultural structures; different photographers; alternate film types; different focal lengths; and composition. Results showed that weather and season were not significant in determining landscape preference; cultural structures increased preferences for landscapes; and photographs taken by different people did not produce consistent results from the predictive models. It was also found that film type was not significant and that changes in focal length altered preferences for landscapes. Financial assistance from The Human Research Trust...|$|R
