50|$|The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> {{is defined}} as the number of repetitions of its {{waveform}} per second, and is measured in hertz; frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (in a medium of uniform propagation velocity, such as sound in air). The wavelength of a sound is the distance between any two consecutive matching points on the waveform. The audible frequency range for young humans is about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Hearing of higher frequencies decreases with age, limiting to about 16 kHz for adults, and even down to 3 kHz for elders.|$|E
50|$|An {{overtone}} is any frequency {{greater than}} the fundamental <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> Using the model of Fourier analysis, the fundamental and the overtones together are called partials. Harmonics, or more precisely, harmonic partials, are partials whose frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental (including the fundamental which is 1 times itself). These overlapping terms are variously used when discussing the acoustic behavior of musical instruments. (See etymology below.) The model of Fourier analysis provides {{for the inclusion of}} inharmonic partials, which are partials whose frequencies are not whole-number ratios of the fundamental (such as 1.1 or 2.14179).|$|E
5000|$|The N100 is preattentive and {{involved}} in perception because its amplitude is strongly dependent upon {{such things as the}} rise time of the onset of a sound, its loudness, [...] interstimulus interval with other sounds, and the comparative <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> as its amplitude increases in proportion to how much a sound differs in frequency from a preceding one. Neuromagnetic research has linked it further to perception by finding that the auditory cortex has a tonotopic organization to N100. However, it also shows a link to a person's arousal and selective attention. N100 is decreased when a person controls the creation of auditory stimuli, such as their own voice.|$|E

5000|$|One {{major goal}} of sensory {{neuroscience}} {{is to try}} to estimate the neuron's receptive field; that is, to try to determine which stimuli cause the neuron to fire in what ways. One common way to find the receptive field is to use linear regression to find which stimulus characteristics typically caused neurons to become excited or depressed. Since the receptive field of a sensory neuron can vary in time (i.e. latency between the stimulus and the effect it has on the neuron) and in some spatial dimension (literally space for vision and somatosensory cells, but other [...] "spatial" [...] dimensions such as the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> for auditory neurons), the term spatio temporal receptive field or STRF is often used to describe these receptive fields.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{physical}} {{sense of the}} term, the word [...] "pitch" [...] refers to the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> Another term that is frequently used by music neuroscientists is [...] "fine-grained pitch processing" [...] which refers {{to the ability of}} a person to distinguish minor changes or fluctuations in pitch. Processing pitch is an extremely integral part of music cognition. Recent developments in brain scanning techniques have shown neuroscientists that the posterior secondary cortex plays an extremely important part in the processing of pitch in the brain. In music, [...] "pitch relation" [...] is more important than pitch itself. A subset of five to seven pitches creates a scale. The scale tones are [...] "not equivalent and are organized around a central tone, called the tonic" [...] (Peretz 2005).|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic {{information}} {{describing the}} environment is the primary data required in soundscape ecology studies. Technological advances have provided improved methods for the collection of such data. Automated recording systems allow for temporally replicated samples of soundscapes to be gathered with relative ease. Data collected from such equipment can be extracted to generate a visual representation of the soundscape {{in the form of}} a spectrogram. Spectrograms provide information on a number of sound properties that may be subject to quantitative analysis. The vertical axis of a spectrogram indicates the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> while the horizontal axis displays the time scale over which sounds were recorded. In addition, spectrograms display the amplitude of sound, a measure of sound intensity. Ecological indices traditionally used with species-level data, such as diversity and evenness, have been adapted for use with acoustic metrics. These measures provide a method of comparing soundscapes across time or space. For example, automated recording devices have been used to gather acoustic data in different landscapes across yearlong time scales, and diversity metrics were employed to evaluate daily and seasonal fluctuations in soundscapes across sites. [...] Spatial patterns of sound may also be studied using tools familiar to landscape ecologists such as geographic information systems (GIS). Finally, recorded samples of the soundscape can provide proxy measures for biodiversity inventories in cases where other sampling methods are impractical or inefficient. These techniques may be especially important for the study of rare or elusive species that are especially difficult to monitor in other ways.|$|E

50|$|This typical 4000 Hz notch {{is due to}} the {{transfer}} function of the ear. Indeed, as any object facing <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> the ear acts as a passive filter (-although the inner ear is not an absolute passive filter, as the outer hair cells provide active mechanisms). A passive filter is a low pass : the high frequencies are more absorbed by the object, as high frequencies impose <b>a</b> higher pace <b>of</b> compression-decompression to the object. Thus, the high <b>frequency</b> harmonics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> are more harmful to the inner-ear.|$|R

40|$|Doppler Effect is {{the change}} in <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> causes by the {{movement}} of the source producing the sound. The distance, velocity of the source movement and speed of sound in medium determines the how the frequency changes. Doppler shift can be reproduced using programming languages like "Matlab". But usually the reproduction quality of the Doppler shift which is produced using the programming language is not anything similar to the Doppler shift experienced in the real life. This is mainly because there are number factors which are ignored while programming the Doppler shift reproduction program. This review focuses on how to reproduce virtual moving source causing Doppler shift more accurately as heard in the natural world. Architecture & Allied Art...|$|E
40|$|The {{equations}} of continuum hydrodynamics can {{be derived}} from the Boltzmann equation, which describes rarefied gas dynamics at the kinetic level, by means of the Chapman-Enskog expansion.

When both frequencies become comparable, these equations give a poor account of the experimental measurements. A series of generalized hydrodynamic equations has been introduced in the literature along the years in order to improve the continuous description of small scale properties of fluid flow, as ultrasound propagation.

40|$|In high-risk pregnancies, the {{transport}} of oxygen and nutrients from maternal to fetal blood via the placenta is often impaired. To assess the risk, pulsed Doppler ultrasound (US) is {{used to evaluate the}} flow velocity waveform in the umbilical artery with the pulsatility index (PI), which is derived from the velocity envelope of the Doppler power spectrum. However, simply listening to the Doppler signal can indicate to an experienced sonographer that the type of the blood flow is worse than the PI suggests. This is however dependent on the operator's experience and {{it may be difficult to}} estimate what influences the subjective judgement. Motivated by the description of the Doppler <b>sounds</b> by <b>an</b> experienced operator (AT) as having a "timbre", this study describes <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> Doppler <b>sounds</b> in search for an index or method with capacity to better evaluate the blood flow in the umbilical artery in high-risk pregnancies.
