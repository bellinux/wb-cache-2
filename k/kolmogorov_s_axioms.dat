A basic proposition is that MV follows from EU under the assumption of quadratic utility. A less recognized proposition, first raised by Markowitz, is that MV is fully justified under EU, {{if and only if}} utility is quadratic. The existing proof of this proposition relies on an assumption from EU, described here as 2 ̆ 2 Buridan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>axiom</b> 2 ̆ 2 after the French philosopher 2 ̆ 7 s fable of the ass that starved out of indifference between two bales of hay. To satisfy this axiom, MV must represent not only 2 ̆ 2 pure 2 ̆ 2 strategies, but also their probability mixtures, as points in the (σ, μ) plane. Markowitz and others have argued that probability mixtures are represented sufficiently by (σ, μ) only under quadratic utility, and hence that MV, interpreted as a mathematical re-expression of EU, implies quadratic utility.

These models are reduced to two valued models via the notion of a generic filter of P. In Section 4, we introduce the notion of a molecule m of P by requiring that every two elements compatible with m be themselves compatible. Then, we prove the equivalence of the existence of a generic filter to that of a molecule in a partially ordered set.

As an application of the results obtained in this Section, we introduce the notion of a subbase S of a poset P and derive some corresponding consequences;In Sections 3 and 4, a key Theorem and a novel technique of transfinite inductive proof are introduced for establishing directly the Tower and Complete Accumulation Point compactness of products of compact topological spaces;The Tower compactness of a topological space T is then proven to be equivalent to the A-inductivity of the poset of all proper open sets of T;In Section 5, coordinatewise construction of complete accumulation points of the countable infinite product of the real unit interval I is given. The results are used in establishing the solvability of infinite systems of linear equations each with at most a countable (finite or infinite) number of unknowns. The existence of a solution of such systems of linear equations over the reals is proved based on the compactness of the product topology and under the assumption that finite subsystem have uniformly bounded solutions;In Section 6, we introduce the concept of Receding sequences of ordinals which serves as the basic motivation for the partition properties of infinite cardinals which in turn lead to the notion of the ramifiablity of infinite cardinals;In Section 7, we consider the question of the existence of ramifiable cardinals and various properties which characterizes them;The existence of a C AC-ramifiable cardinal can be shown in ZFC + MA + ¬CH (where MA is the Martin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>axiom).</b> This fact is proved in Section 7 in a rather simple way;In the absence of Martin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>axiom,</b> however, a useful characterization of ramifiable cardinals can be derived.

Since countries differ in regard to demographic or economic development viewpoints, they may have very different adaptation capacities. The Kyoto Protocol states that climate policies {{have to take into account}} “common but differentiated responsibility” of the countries, for this reason a special attention is given to the postwelfarist approach of ethical issues which demands an explicit account of responsibility considerations in resource allocation.

History variables are special variables, which are added to a program to facilitate its proof by recording the sequence of states reached by the program during a computation; after the proof has been completed the history variables may be deleted. The use of such variables in correctness proofs was first suggested by Clint [CL 73] in a paper entitled 2 ̆ 2 Program Proving: Coroutines; 2 ̆ 2 subsequently, history variables have been used by Owicki [OW 76 a] and Howard [HO 75] in verifying concurrent programs and by Apt [APT 77] in verifying sequential programs.

40|$|The {{number of}} test cases {{needed to achieve}} branch {{coverage}} is important to evaluate the effort needed to test a given program. However, the bounds proposed {{so far in the}} literature are not effective to measure testing effort. In this paper, we introduce a new, meaningful lower bound on the number of test cases needed to achieve branch coverage. We first identify the set of unconstrained arcs in a ddgraph. This is the minimum set of arcs such that a set of paths that exercises these arcs covers all the branches in the program. In general, a path may cover more than one unconstrained arc: the strategy we use to combine more unconstrained arcs into one path determines the cardinality of the set of test paths thus obtained, i. e., the bound we are looking for. It is now commonly accepted that the real problem in branch testing is to derive an executable set of test paths. Therefore, we will consider those control flow paths containing a low number of decisions as being meaningful, since {{they are more likely to}} be feasible. We formalize this notion by introducing the weak incomparability relation between ddgraph arcs. We then define the new, meaningful bound as the maximum number of unconstrained arcs in a ddgraph that are mutually weakly incomparable. Furthermore, we discuss interesting properties of this new bound. We analyze the bound with respect to Weyuker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>axioms</b> for complexity measures (Weyuker, 1988), and we show that the bound fits into the testability model of Bache and Mullerburg (Bache and Mullerburg, 1990) ...|$|R
