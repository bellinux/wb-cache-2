5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E

25|$|Wallonia had rich coalfields {{over much}} of its area, and the highly folded nature of coal seams meant {{that it could be}} found at {{relatively}} shallow depths. <b>Deep</b> <b>mines</b> were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions, often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of Mons was 361, and in 1866, 437 meters and some pits had reached down 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same method of operation had been used in Swedish iron mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden pump rods to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in <b>deep</b> <b>mines,</b> it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners. The first formal engine was installed in 1833 at a mine at Clausthal, Lower Saxony, where inspector Wilhelm Albert and manager Georg Dörell (1793–1854) fastened foot platforms and hand-holds to adjacent, reciprocating pump rods, using a waterwheel-driven pump put out of use when a new drainage adit was made at a lower level. The 1837 man engine at the Samson Pit in Sankt Andreasberg in the same region is still in use, although converted from water to electric power in 1922.|$|E
500|$|The Bradford Coalfield is {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} the Manchester Coalfield; its coal seams, laid down in the Carboniferous period, dip at an average of 1 in 3 towards the south and correspond more closely with those of the Oldham Coalfield. The Upper Coal Measures above the Worsley Four Foot mine horizon were worked at Bradford, where the Worsley Four Foot is known as the Parker mine. The Two Foot, Doctor, New, Yard, Bradford Four Foot, Three Quarters and Charlotte mines, above the Parker mine, are known as the Bradford Group; the Charlotte mine is closest to the surface. The Openshaw mine, above the Charlotte, was worked for fireclay. Below the Bradford Group and the Parker mine are the Top, Middle and <b>Deep</b> <b>mines,</b> and [...] below them, the Roger mine. The Top, Middle and <b>Deep</b> <b>mines</b> correspond to the Major, Bland, and Ashton Great mines in the Oldham Coalfield. The Crombouke mine in the western coalfield corresponds to the Roger mine at Bradford Colliery. In total the workable seams contained 310million long tons (347million short tons) of coal.|$|E

[...] The neighboring Tamarack mine became the world's <b>deepest</b> <b>mine</b> for some years; it was bought by Calumet & Hecla, and {{became part of the}} Calumet & Hecla system. The Tamarack/C&H remained the world's <b>deepest</b> <b>mine</b> until about 1915, when its vertical depth of 5,500 feet was exceeded by the 5,824-foot depth of the Morro Velho gold mine in Brazil.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, the Morro Velho mine {{reached a}} {{vertical}} depth of 5,824 feet, {{which made it}} the <b>deepest</b> <b>mine</b> in the world.

500|$|The first {{coal mines}} in the Twomile Run {{watershed}} were <b>deep</b> <b>mines,</b> {{but there are}} no surviving maps of them. Surface mining of the Lower Kittanning and Upper Kittanning coals began after World War Two, with the Lower Kittanning coal being mined to a depth of [...] By the 1970s, the surface mining had ended. Much of the coal mined in the entire Kettle Creek watershed was in the Twomile Run watershed.|$|E
500|$|Anthracite was mined in {{the upper}} part of the Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} from 1840 until 1950. However, farming was also done in the western part of the watershed in the early 20th century. Most of the <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> ceased operation by 1960. Surface mines instead continued mining operations in the watershed. A total of 12 million short tons of anthracite were mined in the creek's watershed in 1917. This was 12% of the anthracite yield of the state of Pennsylvania in that year. In the 1910s, there were 40 washeries and collieries that drained into the creek. Large amounts of culm also flowed into it during this time. The layer of coal silt on the banks of the creek was [...] by 1940. Several mines remain active in the 21st century, but they mostly reprocess coal waste.|$|E
500|$|Horses and ponies {{began to}} be used in Britain's mining pits in the 18th century, to haul [...] "tubs" [...] of coal and ore from the working face to the lifts, in <b>deep</b> <b>mines,</b> or to the surface in {{shallower}} mines. Many of these ponies were Shetlands, as their small size was combined with great strength. A stud farm {{for the sole purpose of}} breeding ponies for the pits was established in 1870 by colliery owner Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, and the Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was formed in 1890 to stop the use of the best stallions in the pits. By 1984, only 55pit ponies were being used by the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. A horse called [...] "Robbie", probably the last to work underground in a British coal mine, was retired from a mine at Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999.|$|E

500|$|The British XVII Corps, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng, relieved the French Tenth Army in the sector in February 1916, permitting the French {{to expand their}} operations at Verdun. The British soon discovered that German tunnelling companies had {{taken advantage of the}} relative calm on the surface to build an extensive network of tunnels and <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> from which they would attack French positions by setting off explosive charges underneath their trenches. The Royal Engineers immediately deployed specialist tunnelling companies along the front to combat the German mining operations. In response to increased British mining aggression, German artillery and trench mortar fire intensified in early May 1916. On 21 May 1916, after shelling both forward trenches and divisional artillery positions from no less than 80 out-of-sight batteries on the reverse slope of the ridge, the German infantry began operation , an attack on the British lines along a [...] front in an effort to eject them from positions along the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. Small counterattacks by units of the 140th and 141st British Brigades took place on 22 May but did not manage to change the situation. The Canadian Corps relieved the British IV Corps stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.|$|E
500|$|The modern town of Blyth {{began to}} develop {{in the first quarter}} of the 18th century. [...] Up until 1716, the land around the Blyth area—the Newsham Estate—was owned by the Earls of Derwentwater, but when the third Earl, James Radclyffe, was {{executed}} for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, the land was forfeited to the crown. [...] On 11 July 1723, the Lordship of Newsham was put up for sale by the Commissioners of Forfeited Estates at their office in the Inner Temple, London. [...] The land was bought by Matthew White and his brother-in-law Richard Ridley. [...] From the 12th century, most port activities were on the north side of the river, but under White and Ridley the first new quays and houses were built on the south side, and from here the port began to prosper. [...] By 1730, a coaling quay, a ballast quay, a pilots' watch house and a lighthouse had all been built at Blyth harbour. [...] In 1765 the first breakwater was constructed, and in 1788 the first staith with an elevated loading point was erected. [...] <b>Deep</b> <b>mines</b> were sunk at Cowpen Colliery and Cowpen Square in 1796 and 1804 respectively, and by 1855, a quarter of a million tons of coal was being shipped from Blyth, rising to three million tons by 1900. [...] The only industry not to survive during this prosperous time was the salt trade, which was heavily taxed during the 18th and early-19th centuries. [...] During the Napoleonic Wars, the tax was increased to provide funds for the military and, even though the tax was abolished in 1825, the industry went into terminal decline. [...] Having had fourteen salt pans at the beginning of the 18th century, exporting over 1,000tons of salt annually, Blyth's salt industry closed in 1876, with the destruction of the last salt pan.|$|E
2500|$|The coal {{industry}} was privatised in December 1994 creating [...] "R.J.B. Mining", subsequently known as UK Coal. [...] Between {{the end of}} the strike and privatisation, pit closures continued with many closures in the early-1990s. There were 15 British Coal <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> left in production at the time of privatisation, but by March 2005, there were only eight <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> left. Since then, the last pit in Northumberland, Ellington Colliery has closed whilst pits at Rossington and Harworth have been mothballed. In 1983, Britain had 174 working collieries; by 2009 there were six. The last deep colliery in the UK, Kellingley Colliery, known locally as [...] "The Big K" [...] closed for the last time on 18 December 2015, bringing an end to centuries of deep coal mining.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{narrow gauge}} Miners' Tramway, opened in 1972 {{under the name}} [...] "Quarry Tours", was a railway {{travelling}} 800 metres underground.
