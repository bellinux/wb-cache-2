2500|$|For example, {{a recipe}} is a process, and not copyrightable, {{but the words}} used to {{describe}} it are; see idea-expression divide and Publications International v Meredith Corp. (1996). Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular cookbook, you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright {{in the choice of}} recipes and their [...] "coordination" [...] and [...] "presentation", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation. [...] It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under patent law.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been in this very room," [...] Father Adrian continued, looking around him, [...] "that your father and Count Hirsfeld stood face to face. But you are {{naturally}} impatient. I will take up the story again <b>in</b> <b>your</b> father's <b>own</b> <b>words</b> to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{verified}} the tale," [...] said Saladin, [...] "by {{causing the}} body to be examined; and I made this unhappy being, whom Allah hath made the discoverer of the crime, repeat <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> presence the <b>words</b> which the murderer spoke; and you yourselves saw the effect which they produced upon his conscience!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Percival, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> solid English <b>words,</b> {{you wanted}} some {{thousands}} and I wanted some hundreds, {{and the only}} way of getting them was for you to raise the money for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> necessity (with a small margin beyond for my poor little hundreds) by the help of your wife. What did I tell you about your wife on our way to England?--and what did I tell you again when we had come here, and when I had seen for myself the sort of woman Miss Halcombe was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{interrupted}} the Professor; [...] "I {{do not want}} you to repeat the poem. I {{want you to tell}} me <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> what sort of a wood it was where the girl lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{agreed the}} Professor; [...] "but I {{want you to}} tell me <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> We do not speak of a maiden, you know; we say a girl. Yes, it is about a girl. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} told your mother yet," [...] she said, [...] "that your infatuation for Mrs. Van Brandt {{is at an}} end. Will you put it <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words?</b> Or shall I write it for you, imitating your {{language}} as well as I can?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I hardly {{expected}} {{you would}} take good advice, but it was my duty to give it. Just now I'll leave you to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> resources, because Dom Pedro is waiting with the chessmen below. Most gentlemanly old rascal, and you are indebted to him; but I wouldn't tell him too much respecting the supposititious treasure you rambled about if I were you. Henceforward {{you will have to}} get better <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> way, because <b>word</b> has just been sent me that my niggers are dying by dozens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take my advice," [...] said my friend, [...] "you will humbly {{endeavour}} {{not to be a}} fool. What is the sense of this mad modern notion that every literary man must live in the country, with the pigs and the donkeys and the squires? Chaucer and Spenser and Milton and Dryden lived in London; Shakespeare and Dr. Johnson came to London because they had had quite enough of the country. And as for trumpery topical journalists like you, why, they would cut their throats in the country. You have confessed it yourself <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> last <b>words.</b> You hunger and thirst after the streets; you think London the finest place on the planet. And if by some miracle a Bayswater omnibus could come down this green country lane you would utter a yell of joy." ...|$|R
50|$|Be {{accountable}} for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> and actions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, dear" [...] {{she said}} in her {{ordinary}} slow voice, [...] "that you had better set out the trouble <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> with as few details as possible, or none at all. Such things are painful, are they not--especially where the dead are concerned?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did; and <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> I can only answer: 'I don't {{know how to}} thank you, but I never shall forget it.'" [...] And David kissed the wounded hand as gratefully and reverently as if its palm was not {{hardened}} by the humblest tasks.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. Tell <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> {{the general}} qualities of Anglo-Saxon poetry. How did it differ in its {{metrical}} form from modern poetry? What passages seem to you worth learning and remembering? Can you explain why poetry is more abundant and {{more interesting than}} prose in the earliest literature of all nations? ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ronald,’ said I, ‘this is {{not your}} doing. These are not <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> I know where they came from: a coward put them <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mouth.’ ...|$|R
25|$|Take {{responsibility}} {{not just}} for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> but for the comments you allow on your blog.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only {{remind you}} of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> sir: you said error brought remorse, and you {{pronounced}} remorse the poison of existence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. He didn't bungle it. He gave it me <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> It {{touched me}} very deeply. It made me see clearly my error and my injustice. I {{owe it to}} you that I should say this by way of amend. I judged too harshly where it was a {{presumption}} to judge at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{what sense}} does the poet intend to [...] "save" [...] the building? Describe {{the scene that}} he recalls. What three types are the suicides? How does the poet know? Why does he deny the failure of their lives? Does he base his optimistic hope on reason or feeling? Note the climax in line's 55-57. State <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> {{the meaning of the}} last six lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} answer <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> Rose--never. If {{you return to}} the Swash, I shall go on board with you, and throw {{defiance}} into the very teeth of Spike. I know the men do not dislike me, and, perhaps, assisted by Señor Montefalderon, and a few friends among the people, I can muster a force that will prevent my being thrown into the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, mejuffrouw. I was pondering on <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> You deigned to {{say just}} now that I--a {{man should be}} {{fighting}} for my country." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{you reach}} the end of the passage, say back to {{yourself}} what the point of the whole passage is - again, using <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] Ernest answered. [...] "And the trusts {{themselves}} destroyed competition. That, by <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> {{is why you}} are {{no longer}} in the dairy business." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Fyne had {{returned}} to her attitude of folded arms. I saw before me {{the daughter of the}} refined poet accepting life whole with its unavoidable conditions of which one of the first is the instinct of self-preservation and the egoism of every living creature. [...] "The fact remains nevertheless that you--yourself--have, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> pulled her in," [...] I insisted in a jocular tone, with a serious intention.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to myself, and stating in {{the first}} place the effect on my understanding, your {{opinions}} and method of argument were not only so new to me, but so directly the reverse of all I had ever been accustomed to consider as truth, that even if I had comprehended your premises sufficiently to have admitted them, and had seen the necessity of your conclusions, I should still have been in that state of mind, which in your note in Chap. IV you have so ingeniously evolved, as the antithesis to that in which a man is, when he makes a bull. <b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> I should have felt as if I had been standing on my head.|$|E
6000|$|The nobler {{method of}} {{quotation}} {{is not to}} quote at all. For why should one repeat good things that are already written? Are not the words in their fittest context in the original? Clearly, then, your new setting cannot be quite so congruous, which is, forthwith, an admission of incongruity. Your quotation is evidently a plug in a leak, an apology for a gap <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> But your vulgar author will even go {{out of his way}} to make the clothing of his thoughts thus heterogeneous. He counts every stolen scrap he can work in an improvement--a literary caddis worm. Yet would he consider it improvement to put a piece of even the richest of old tapestry or gold embroidery into his new pair of breeks? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naw! 'Twasn't Williams. You can't bluff this bunch, Leslie. By <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> Williams is lookin' for us, an' if he's lookin' {{for anybody}} I know he's lookin' for 'em. See!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Put <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Words</b> To It/You Move Me (Sniff #395) (about 1975) (as Billy) ("Put Your Words To It" [...] is an {{instrumental}} version of Sal-Wa recording [...] "Take It Easy Greasy") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the meanwhile, I beg you to {{look back}} into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> thoughts, to recall <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> on the day when Madame Pratolungo {{offended}} you in the rectory garden. On that occasion, the truth escaped the Frenchwoman's lips--and she knew it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I am so glad," [...] she cried. [...] "You know, I {{have had}} qualms. When {{you told me}} the story <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> picking your {{language}} so carefully, and building it all up before me, well, you know what I said. I gave you more than hope--I promised you success. And then, when I got away into the hard, stagey world of Chicago, and my manager talked business to me, and my last playwright preached of technique, I began to wonder whether, after all, you could bring your ideas together like this, whether {{you would have a}} sense of perspective--you know what I mean, don't you? And you have it, and the play is going to be wonderful, and I shall produce it. Why don't you look pleased, Mr. Author? You are going to be famous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR FANNY,--I {{have given}} Mr Crimble your message; first, exactly [...] <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> {{though he did}} not quite hear them, and then, [...] leaving out a little. You may be angry at what I am going to [...] say--but I am quite sure you ought to answer him at once. Fanny, [...] he's dreadfully fond of you. I never even dreamed people were [...] like that--in such torture for what can't be, unless you mean you [...] do care, but are too proud to tell him so. If he knows you have [...] no heart for him, he may soon be better. This sounds hateful. But I [...] am not such a pin in a pincushion as not to know that even the [...] {{greatest}} sorrows and disappointments wear out. Why, isn't that [...] beech-tree we sat under a kind of cannibal of its own dead leaves? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Do {{not blame}} {{me if you}} don't like it, and do not set me down as a prig, though I am {{going to tell you}} your faults as I read them <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> You are proud and ambitious, and the cramped lines in which you are forced to live seem to {{strangle}} you. You have suffered, and have not learned the lesson of suffering--humility. You have set yourself up against Fate, and Fate sweeps you along like spray upon the gale, yet you go unwilling. In your impatience you have flown to learning for refuge, and it has completed your overthrow, for it has induced you to reject as non-existent all that you cannot understand. Because your finite mind cannot search infinity, because no answer has come to all your prayers, because you see misery and cannot read its purpose, because you suffer and have not found rest, you have said there is naught but chance, and become an atheist, as many have done before you. Is it not true?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last, traitor, I {{have found}} you out. <b>Your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> have {{condemned}} you {{as surely as}} the acts of these red creatures have sealed their fates--unless--" [...] He paused. [...] "Unless the woman--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will be just}} as much {{stealing}} as if {{you took}} both," [...] said the second voice. [...] "Besides, you will be breaking <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word.</b> You said that you never would take another egg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You have {{declared}} that our farewell to-day is our farewell forever. For the second time, you {{have refused to}} be my wife; and you have done this, to use <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> <b>in</b> mercy to Me.|$|R
