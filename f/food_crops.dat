40|$|The study {{analyzed}} <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility {{in different}} agricultural policy programme periods in Nigeria. Data from FAO and publications of Central Bank of Nigeria covering the period 1961 to 2009 {{was used in}} the study. Unit root test was conducted on the specified time series. The GARCH (1, 1) model was used to generate the <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> output volatility. A combination of descriptive analysis and analysis of variance model (ANOVA) based on OLS estimation technique was used to analyze data. The results revealed that Pre-Operation Feed the Nation period (1961 - 1976) and Structural Adjustment Programme (1986 - 1993) period were the most volatile sub periods for most <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> outputs in the country. Whereas, <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> outputs were most stable during the Operation Feed the Nation period (1976 - 1979) and Green Revolution period (1980 - 1985). Also, the mean <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> outputs showed a progressive growth rate across the policy programme periods since 1961, and were best during Post Structural Adjustment period (1994 - 2009). The result of the ANOVA prove the fact that the agricultural policy programmes actually influenced key <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> outputs and their volatilities; but these influences were mixed and inconsistence across <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> enterprises and policy regimes in the country. Following the results of the study, we recommend that government should formulate appropriate specific <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> policy packages as part of the holistic agricultural policy programme. This kind of policy programme would ensure quick intervention and promote result oriented <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> policy programme in the country...|$|R

40|$|The {{part-time}} farmers {{like other}} farmers will typically produce to satisfy household food needs or make profit from selling or both. Either {{of the two}} objectives of production requires efficient use of farm resources as efficiency {{is at the heart}} of agricultural production. In this paper, stochastic frontier cost model is used to analyze the allocative efficiency of part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Idah Local Government Area of Kogi State, North Central Nigeria and also to establish the socio-economic factors that determine allocative efficiency. It is evident from the study that part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers are not fully efficient in their allocation of production resources. This was confirmed by the presence of allocative inefficiency effects in part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farming with average allocative efficiency of 97. 95 %. The study also revealed that rising age and household size contribute to allocative inefficiency in part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farming, while level of education and farming experience were found to increase allocative efficiency among the part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers. It is recommended that policies aimed at encouraging relatively younger and educated persons and providing them easy access to improved seeds and fertilizers should be formulated. This will go a long way in enhancing allocative efficiency in part-time <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farming...|$|R

5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the <b>food</b> <b>crops</b> that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the determinants of informal credit delinquencies among <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in rural Niger Delta of Nigeria using Akwa Ibom State as a case study. A multi-stage random sampling technique was adopted to select 96 beneficiaries and structured questionnaires as well as personal interview were used to collect data. Probit and logit models were used to analyse the factors influencing credit delinquency among <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in the state. Result of the descriptive analysis of the socio-economic characteristic of respondents revealed that 93 % of male and 72 % of female <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers had one form of formal education ranging from primary to tertiary education. Empirical result from the Probit and logit models were similar and showed that borrower’s non-farm income, credit amount received, household size, net farm profit and farm size are determinants of credit delinquencies among <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Akwa Ibom state. The study also discovered that the probability of <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers being credit delinquent is about 0. 427 ceteris paribus. It is recommended that <b>food</b> <b>crop</b> farmers should form marketing co-operative societies {{as a means of}} generating additional income to augment loan obtained.

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed <b>food</b> <b>crops.</b> Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E

There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed <b>food</b> <b>crops,</b> which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage.

Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with <b>food</b> <b>crops,</b> many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties.
