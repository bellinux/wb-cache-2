5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime <b>found</b> <b>him</b> useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
