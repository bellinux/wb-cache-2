40|$|This thesis uses {{a systems}} {{approach}} {{to develop a}} model for Collaborative Project Design (CPD). Failure of the software process is the area of concern. The focus of the argument is, however, on the organizational environment of the software process. A central argument is that the <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> of standard software development methodologies are inappropriate for systems synthesis. They provide little assistance in coping with the loose complexity that {{is inherent in the}} organizational environment in which the software process is <b>embedded.</b> These <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> and the engineering language and metaphor which dominate the software process undermine collaboration and disempower business users. CPD was developed to enable viable collaboration that is necessary for the software process to succeed. The purpose of CPD is to provide a systemic model of causal influences and social process in order to guide a project designer when intervening in projects which call for acts of shared creation and/or discovery. CPD was developed through a combination of action research (in projects involving software development and organisational transformation) and theoretical readings focused on the philosophy of meaning, systems thinking, social process and the software process. CPD emphasises that a collaborative project requires careful design of its underlying languages, metaphors and conversations. It identifies three distinct types of conversation, namely communication, dialogue and collaboration. The thesis describes how these conversation types are utilised in transforming a project's network of commitments from loose complexity via shared meaning to cohesive simplicity. Associated with each conversation type is a set of project influences which are developed into a causal influence model in order to depict a collaborative project as a dynamic system of mutually interdependent influences. This causal influence model was used to synthesise the learning from action research and the theoretical readings. An appreciative systems framework was then derived in order to justify a collaborative project as a self-regulating social system and was overlaid onto the causal influence model in order to derive CPD in its final form. CPD proved beneficial when tested in practical projects as a framework to organise a project designer's mind when designing project interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Web <b>analytics</b> <b>tools</b> offer a {{quantity}} of features to website operators. While mostly used in the e-commerce sector, recently web analytics has also been discovered by social software users, e. g. blog writers. Because web <b>analytics</b> <b>tools</b> were initially not built for this purpose and the technology used in many social software platforms, e. g. JavaScript and Flash, is challenging, this paper examines their applicability in social software environments. Additionally, this paper searches for potential benefits arising from the interaction of web <b>analytics</b> <b>tools</b> and social software. Therefore, a tool analysis is performed to determine the capabilities of today’s web <b>analytics</b> <b>tools.</b> Based on the outcome, scenarios are developed to illustrate potential benefits for social software users. In addition, a prototypic implementation demonstrates their feasibility and shows how the data gathered by web <b>analytics</b> <b>tools</b> can {{be returned to the}} user. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Embedding</b> <b>analytics</b> {{is about}} {{integrating}} data analytics into operational {{systems that are}} part of an organization’s business processes. Currently, most organizations focus on automation business processes and enhancing productivity. However, going forward, in order to stay competitive, organizations have to go beyond automating their processes, by making them more intelligent, by <b>embedding</b> <b>analytics</b> into their processes and business applications. Therefore, there is need for enhancing the knowledge and skills of BPM professionals with know-how on improving a business process by <b>embedding</b> <b>analytics</b> into the workflow. In this paper contribution, the authors share their experience on how an existing process modelling, analysis and solution designing course was modified in order to incorporate the analytics component. The paper describes in detail the content, pedagogy, and lessons learned when introducing analytics into an existing business process modelling course. Thus providing one pathway for IS professors to adapt their current process modelling, enterprise systems and BPM courses to include analytics...|$|R

40|$|Companies analyse {{large amounts}} of {{sensitive}} data on clusters of machines, using a framework such as Apache Hadoop to handle inter-process communication, and big data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink to analyse the growing amounts of data. Big data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> are mainly tested on performance and reliability. Security and authentication have not been enough considered and they lack behind. The goal {{of this research is}} to improve the authentication and security for data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools.</b> Currently, the aforementioned big data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> are using Kerberos for authentication. Kerberos has difficulties in providing multi factor authentication. Attacks on Kerberos can abuse the authentication. To improve the authentication, an analysis of the authentication in Hadoop and the data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> is performed. The research describes the characteristics to gain an overview of the security of Hadoop and the data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools.</b> One characteristic is that the usage of the transport layer security (TLS) for the security of data transportation. TLS usually establishes connections with certificates. Recently, certificates with a short time to live can be automatically handed out. This thesis develops new authentication mechanism using certificates for data <b>analytic</b> <b>tools</b> on clusters of machines, providing advantages over Kerberos. To evaluate the possibility to replace Kerberos, the mechanism is implemented in Spark. As a result, the new implementation provides several improvements. The certificates used for authentication are made valid with a short time to live and are thus less vulnerable to abuse. Further, the authentication mechanism solves new requirements coming from businesses, such as providing multi-factor authenticationand scalability. In this research a new authentication mechanism is developed, implemented and evaluated, giving better data protection by providing improved authentication...|$|R
