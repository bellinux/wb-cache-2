50|$|Very tight {{weight and}} {{dimensional}} tolerances {{can be obtained}} on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends. It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary <b>flowhead</b> die on the other end. In shuttle machinery and reciprocating screw machinery multiple parisons are extruded and are free hanging. Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary wheel machinery.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe recent {{progress}} {{achieved in}} the EU-funded <b>FlowHead</b> project with development of shape and topology optimisation for fluid flow with application to automotive design is demonstrated. The advances with continuous and discrete adjoint solvers are described, {{as well as a}} mesh-based and a CAD-based parametrisation approach used in the project. Application examples in automotive design are presented...|$|E
40|$|Ten symptomless smokers were {{switched}} from their usual cigarette {{to a low}} tar, low nicotine test cigarette for two weeks to investigate their immediate response and subsequent acclimatisation to the test cigarette. The tar (T) and nicotine (N) yields of the test cigarettes were T = 3. 8 mg, N = 0. 6 mg; the median yields of the usual cigarettes were T = 16. 4 mg, N = 1. 4 mg. The subjects were monitored over a six week period comprising a control period (usual cigarette), a test period (test cigarette), and a return period (usual cigarette), each lasting two weeks. The inhaled smoke volume (smoke from the burning tip of the cigarette which is subsequently inhaled) was measured with a non-invasive radiotracer technique. Puffing indices were recorded using an electronic smoking analyser and <b>flowhead</b> cigarette holder. Measurements were made {{at the beginning of}} the control period, at the beginning and end of the test period, and at the end of the return period. Subjects kept records of their cigarette consumption during each of the three periods. Apart from a small change in puff duration, cigarettes were smoked in the same way during the control and return periods. Mean and total puff volumes increased with the low tar, low nicotine cigarette but did not change from the beginning to the end of the test period. There was no significant change between the control, test, and return periods for mean inhaled smoke volume, total inhaled smoke volume, or cigarette consumption. It is concluded that when smokers are switched to a low tar, low nicotine cigarette the puff volume increases but there is no change in the inhaled smoke volume or daily consumption...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Estimation of {{respiratory}} deadspace is {{often based on}} the CO 2 expirogram, however presence of the CO 2 sensor increases equipment deadspace, which in turn influences breathing pattern and calculation of lung volume. In addition, {{it is necessary to}} correct for the delay between the sensor and flow signals. We propose a new method for estimation of effective deadspace using the molar mass (MM) signal from an ultrasonic flowmeter device, which does not require delay correction. We hypothesize that this estimation is correlated with that calculated from the CO 2 signal using the Fowler method. METHODS: Breath-by-breath CO 2, MM and flow measurements were made in a group of 77 term-born healthy infants. Fowler deadspace (Vd,Fowler) was calculated after correcting for the flow-dependent delay in the CO 2 signal. Deadspace estimated from the MM signal (Vd,MM) was defined as the volume passing through the <b>flowhead</b> between start of expiration and the 10 % rise point in MM. RESULTS: Correlation (r = 0. 456, P < 0. 0001) was found between Vd,MM and Vd,Fowler averaged over all measurements, with a mean difference of - 1. 4 % (95 % CI - 4. 1 to 1. 3 %). Vd,MM ranged from 6. 6 to 11. 4 ml between subjects, while Vd,Fowler ranged from 5. 9 to 12. 0 ml. Mean intra-measurement CV over 5 - 10 breaths was 7. 8 +/- 5. 6 % for Vd,MM and 7. 8 +/- 3. 7 % for Vd,Fowler. Mean intra-subject CV was 6. 0 +/- 4. 5 % for Vd,MM and 8. 3 +/- 5. 9 % for Vd,Fowler. Correcting for the CO 2 signal delay resulted in a 12 % difference (P = 0. 022) in Vd,Fowler. Vd,MM could be obtained more frequently than Vd,Fowler in infants with CLD, with a high variability. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the MM signal provides a feasible estimate of Fowler deadspace without introducing additional equipment deadspace. The simple calculation without need for delay correction makes individual adjustment for deadspace in FRC measurements possible. This is especially important given the relative large range of deadspace seen in this homogeneous group of infants...|$|E
