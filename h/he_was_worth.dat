5|$|In 1987, Gates {{was listed}} as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> $1.25billion and was the world's {{youngest}} self-made billionaire. Since 1987, Gates has {{been included in the}} Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014. Gates was number one on Forbes 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.|$|E
5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> the big money.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} in Valencia's Champions League group-stage defeat {{at home to}} Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 1–0 down to third-tier opponents Real Union. Žigić came on and scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman {{changed his mind about}} the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances (two starts) in what remained of the season, and was sent off in the first of those.|$|E

25|$|With {{business}} booming by 1855, Colt {{entered an}} aggressive expansionary phase {{and opened the}} Colt Armory, the world's largest private armament factory. He employed advanced manufacturing techniques such as interchangeable parts and an organized production line. By 1856, the company could produce 150 weapons per day. The Civil War led to a surge in demand, and Colt supplied the Union Army. Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company operated at full capacity and employed over 1,000 people in its Hartford factory. By that time, Colt {{had become one of}} the wealthiest men in America. He was presiding over his enterprise from Armsmear, an ornate Italianate manor built near the armory in 1857. Upon his death in 1862, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> over $15 million ($380 million by 2015 standards).|$|E
500|$|Shackleton knew Crean {{well from}} the Discovery Expedition, and also knew of his {{exploits}} on Scott's last expedition. Like Scott, Shackleton [...] trusted Crean: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth,</b> in Shackleton's own word, [...] "trumps". Crean joined Shackleton's Imperial Transantarctic Expedition on 25 May 1914, as second officer, with a varied range of duties. In {{the absence of}} a Canadian dog-handling expert who was hired but never appeared, Crean took charge of one of the dog-handling teams, and was later involved in the care and nurture of the pups born to one of his dogs, Sally, early in the expedition.|$|E
500|$|The J. Paul Getty Museum Trust was {{established}} by oilman J. Paul Getty in 1953. Getty founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American. At his death, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> more than $2 billion. [...] Getty died in 1976 and left {{the bulk of his}} estate, including nearly $660 million worth of stock in Getty Oil, to the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust. Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received Getty's full bequest. The trust began to add a number of new programs in 1982, and in February 1983, it petitioned the court to change its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.|$|E

500|$|Grant's {{contract}} expired {{at the end}} of the 1952 NFL {{season and}} the Eagles refused to pay him what he thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth.</b> The Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL had been interested in Grant while in college. Grant left for Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1953 and became the first professional player to [...] "play out his option" [...] and leave for another team. He played for the Blue Bombers until 1956 as an offensive end and was named a Western Conference all-star three times. He led the Western Conference in pass receptions for the 1953, 1954, and 1956 seasons and receiving yards for the 1953 and 1956 seasons. He also holds the distinction of having five interceptions in a playoff game, played on October 28, 1953, which is a CFL record. The Blue Bombers played for the Grey Cup in 1953, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 41st Grey Cup game.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Thompson went 12–8 for the Maple Leafs, {{the second-best}} win–loss record among the team's regular {{starting}} pitchers (20 or more starts). He was {{third on the}} team with 161 innings pitched, allowed the most earned runs (91), and posted a 5.09 ERA. At {{the end of the}} season, manager Eddie Sawyer called Thompson and Jim Konstanty up to the major league level. As per the working agreement between the teams, the major league club paid Toronto for the rights to each Maple Leafs player it called up: $25,000 ($ in current terms) for the first player, and $5,000 ($ currently) for each player thereafter. Sawyer recalled that Pete Campbell, Toronto's owner, and Konstanty [...] "didn't get along... they were both the same". Although Campbell was [...] "glad to get rid of Konstanty", he told Sawyer to take Thompson as the $25,000 player because he did not want Konstanty to think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> the larger fee.|$|E
500|$|Other {{conspiracy}} theories {{point to the}} British, the German Abwehr intelligence agency or the Poles themselves, some of whom (especially {{under the command of}} General Anders) had shown animosity toward Sikorski for, at least from their point of view, his policy of [...] "colluding" [...] with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, which reached new heights by the Germans' April 1943 discovery of mass graves filled with thousands of Polish prisoners of war murdered by the Soviets at Katyn Forest in 1940. Most notably though, in 1967 the controversial British historical writer David Irving published a book dedicated to this incident, and suggesting British complicity in the incident. Meanwhile, it seems unlikely to some that the Nazis — dedicated adversaries of Sikorski and vice versa — who had secret agents of the Abwehr just across the border in neutral Spain, would have wanted to murder Sikorski, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> more to them alive instead of dead.|$|E

500|$|Unsettled in Italy, Henry {{transferred}} from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal {{for an estimated}} fee of £11million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> the transfer fee. Brought in {{as a replacement for}} fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games. After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to [...] "be re-taught everything about the art of striking." [...] These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26. Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Turkish club Galatasaray.|$|E
500|$|By {{the last}} week of July, however, questions—due {{initially}} to reporting by The New York Times—began about Ferraro's finances, the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro, and their separately filed tax returns. (While the Mondale campaign had anticipated some questions, it had only spent 48 hours on vetting Ferraro's family's finances.) This was also the first time the American media had to deal with a national candidate's husband. Ferraro said she would release both their returns within a month, but maintained she was correct not to have included her husband's financial holdings on her past annual Congressional disclosure statements. The media also reported on the FEC's past investigation into Ferraro's 1978 campaign funds. Although Ferraro and Zaccaro's finances were often interwoven on paper, with each half partners in Zaccaro's company, Ferraro had little knowledge of his business, or even how much <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth.</b> Zaccaro did not understand the greater public exposure that his wife's new position brought to their family, and resisted releasing his financial information. On , Ferraro announced that her husband would not in fact be releasing his tax returns, on the grounds that to do so would disadvantage his real estate business and that such a disclosure was voluntary and not part of election law. She joked, [...] "You people who are married to Italian men, you know what it's like", angering fellow Italian Americans.|$|E
500|$|Piquet {{took the}} team's last wins: two in 1984 {{by winning the}} seventh and eighth races of that season, the Canadian Grand Prix and the Detroit Grand Prix, and one in 1985 by winning the French Grand Prix, before reluctantly leaving for the Williams team {{at the end of}} the season. After seven years and two world championships, he felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> more than Ecclestone's salary offer for 1986. Piquet {{finished}} fifth in 1984 and a mere eighth in 1985 in the respective Drivers' Championships. The 1986 season was a disaster for Brabham. Murray's radical long and low BT55, with its BMW M12 engine tilted over to improve its aerodynamics and lower its centre of gravity, scored only two points. Driver Elio de Angelis became the Formula One team's only fatality when he died in a testing accident at the Paul Ricard circuit. Derek Warwick, who replaced de Angelis, was close to scoring two points for fifth in the British Grand Prix, but a problem on the last lap dropped him out of the points. In August, BMW after considering running their own in-house team, announced their departure from Formula One {{at the end of the}} season. Murray, who had largely taken over the running of the team as Ecclestone became more involved with his role at the Formula One Constructors Association, felt that [...] "the way the team had operated for 15 years broke down". He left Brabham in November to join McLaren.|$|E

500|$|Hastings {{continued}} {{to practice law}} after his term as Attorney General ended, and also {{became a member of}} the Henley, Hastings & Co. bank firm located in Sacramento, California. The banking firm failed, with little loss to him though. Around 1857, he left professional life, and started investing in real estate. He and his wife had seven more children after this: Charles Foster Dio., Douglas, Uhler, Robert Paul, Flora Azalea, Ella, and Lillie. He gradually acquired around one hundred lots of real estate in San Francisco, and bought large tracts of land in Solano, Napa, Lake, and Sacramento counties. In 1861, he put up many four-room buildings in the south side of San Francisco for the poor with the money he earned in real estate. The rent was $10 a month, and as a business venture it was a success. By 1862, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> $900,000, which was largely attributed to his real estate investments. In 1865, he traveled to Europe; four years later he accompanied William H. Seward to view the recently purchased territory of Alaska. Hastings College of Law, the law department of the University of California, was founded on March 28, 1878 with his donation of $100,000. [...] The college offered him the position of dean and he accepted the offer. He was professor of comparative jurisprudence at the college as well, a position he held until 1887. He helped establish St. Catherine Academy in Benicia, California, with a donation of $6,000. He also helped publish two volumes of the botany of the Pacific coast. His contribution to botany would later be recognized by having the plant genus Hastingsia named after him.|$|E
500|$|Orton began feuding {{with the}} McMahon {{family on the}} January 19, 2009 episode of Raw when he confronted both Mr. McMahon and Stephanie, {{claiming}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> more than her, {{and that she had}} become [...] "worthless". This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he'd terminate him on the spot. As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked him and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher. On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H. The next night on Raw, Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a [...] "loss of control" [...] because of the disorder. He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, {{due to the fact that}} he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble. Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said she had [...] "bigger plans", leading to Shane McMahon returning to Raw and attacking Orton. This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won. The next night on Raw, Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match. Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an RKO. This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton [...] "crossed the line" [...] when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife. Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution; according to Orton, Triple H [...] "ruined his life", so Orton was going to do the same and take everything that Triple H cared about away from him. He challenged Triple H for the WWE title at WrestleMania XXV, which he was unsuccessful. He won it the next month at Backlash by pinning Triple H in a special six-man tag team match between The Legacy and Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon. At Extreme Rules, he lost the title to Batista in a Steel Cage match. The following night on Raw, Orton and Legacy attacked Batista and broke his arm, forcing him to vacate the title. On the June 15 Raw, Orton regained the title in a fatal four-way match, over Triple H, John Cena and Big Show. He lost the title to John Cena in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at Breaking Point. He then regained it from Cena in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell. At Bragging Rights, Orton again lost the title to Cena in a one-hour Iron Man match.|$|E
