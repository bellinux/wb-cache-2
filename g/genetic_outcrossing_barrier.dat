The MICs of coumarins (novobiocin and coumermycin) for MT 5, a Staphylococcus aureus nov mutant, are higher than those for wild-type strains. Sequencing the gyrB gene encoding one subunit of the DNA gyrase revealed the presence of a double mutation likely to be responsible for this resistance: at codon 102 (Ile to Ser) and at codon 144 (Arg to Ile). For single-step flqA mutant MT 5224 c 9, previously selected on ciprofloxacin, the fluoroquinolone MIC was higher and the coumarin MIC was lower than those for its parent, MT 5. Sequencing the grlB and grlA genes of topoisomerase IV of MT 5224 c 9 showed a single Asn- 470 -to-Asp mutation in GrlB. <b>Genetic</b> <b>outcrosses</b> by transformation with chromosomal DNA and introduction of plasmids carrying either the wild-type or the mutated grlB gene indicated that this mutation causes both increased MICs of fluoroquinolones and decreased MICs of coumarins and that the mutant grlB allele is codominant for both phenotypes with multicopy alleles. Integration of these plasmids into the chromosome confirmed the codominance of fluoroquinolone resistance, but grlB+ appeared dominant over grlB (Asp- 470) for coumarin resistance. Finally, the gyrA (Leu- 84) mutation previously described as silent for fluoroquinolone resistance increased the MIC of nalidixic acid, a nonfluorinated quinolone. Combining the grlA (Phe- 80) and grlB (Asp- 470) mutations with this gyrA mutation also had differing effects. The findings indicate that alterations in topoisomerases may have pleiotropic effects on different classes of inhibitors as well as on inhibitors within the same class.

Outcrossing in conifers is promoted via an embryo-lethal system, but the genetic mechanism is poorly understood. This study is the first experimental profile of the <b>genetic</b> mechanism promoting <b>outcrossing</b> in conifers. Molecular dissection of a Pinus taeda L. selfed pedigree detected a chromosomal region identified as PtTX 3020 -RPtest 9. Within this region, a semilethal factor was tightly linked (r = 0. 0076) to a polymorphic expressed sequence tag (EST). The linkage group flanking the lethal factor showed strong heterozygote advantage. Using genotypic frequencies for the linkage group, three hypotheses about the semilethal factor could be tested: (1) the presence of a balanced lethal system, i. e., a lethal factor present in each of the two marker intervals; (2) gametic selection operative prior to fertilization; and (3) a stage-specific lethal factor. Selection acted via the embryo-lethal system. No support for a genetic mechanism operating prior to fertilization was found. The semilethal factor exerted no effect after embryo maturity.

Amplification of grlA sequences (codons 1 to 251) by PCRs from nine independent single-step flqA mutants, one multistep mutant, and the parent strain identified mutations encoding a change from Ser to Phe at position 80 in four mutants, a novel change from Ala to either Glu or Pro at position 116 in three mutants, and no change in three mutants. In the multistep mutant, another resistance locus, flqC, was mapped by transformation to the chromosomal SmaI G fragment by linkage to omega(ch::Tn 551) 1051 (58 %) and nov (97. 9 %), which encodes resistance to novobiocin. This fragment contains the gyrA gene, and flqC mutants had a mutation in gyrA encoding a change from Ser to Leu at position 84, a change previously found in resistant clinical isolates. In <b>genetic</b> <b>outcrosses,</b> the flqC (gyrA) mutation expressed resistance only in flqA mutants, including those with both types of grla mutations. The silent mutant allele of gyrA was present in a flqA background and expressed resistance only upon introduction of a grlA mutation. At fourfold the MIC of ciprofloxacin, the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin was reduced in a grlA mutant and was abolished in gyrA grlA double mutants. These findings provide direct genetic evidence that topoisomerase IV is the primary target of current fluoroquinolones in S. aureus and that this effect may result from the greater sensitivity of topoisomerase IV relative to that of DNA gyrase to these agents. Furthermore, resistance from an altered DNA gyrase requires resistant topoisomerase IV for its expression...|$|R

The endangered Norwegian Lundehund dog underwent at least two severe bottlenecks in the 1940 s and 1960 s that each left only five inbred dogs, and the approximately 1500 dogs remaining world-wide today appear to descend from only two individuals. The Lundehund has a high prevalence of a gastrointestinal disease, to which all remaining dogs may be predisposed. Outcrossing is currently performed with three Nordic Spitz breeds: Norwegian Buhund, Icelandic Sheepdog, and Norrbottenspets. Examination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes based on 165 K loci in 48 dogs from the four breeds revealed substantially lower genetic diversity for the Lundehund (HE 0. 035) than for other breeds (HE 0. 209 - 0. 284). Analyses of genetic structure with > 15 K linkage disequilibrium-pruned SNPs showed four distinct genetic clusters. Pairwise FST values between Lundehund and the candidate breeds were highest for Icelandic Sheepdog, followed by Buhund and Norrbottenspets. We assessed the presence of outlier loci among candidate breeds and examined flanking genome regions (1 megabase) for genes under possible selection to identify potential adaptive differences among breeds; outliers were observed in flanking regions of genes associated with key functions including the immune system, metabolism, cognition and physical development.

To address this issue, I used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of outcrossing of inbred populations on reproductive fitness in F 1, F 2 and F 3 (and later) generations for population crosses screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. Outcrossing of inbred populations was significantly beneficial compared to the inbred parent in the F 1, F 2 and F 3 (and later) generations, with 90. 5 %, 100 % and 94. 1 % of comparisons beneficial, respectively. The median benefits of outcrossing on composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) were 42 %, 84 % and 86 % in the F 1, F 2 and F 3 generations, respectively, and F 2 and F 3 effects were not significantly different from those in the F 1. Further, pre-screening to detect possible outbreeding depression was highly effective.

Such genetic exchange may increase the efficacy of selection by breaking down Hill-Robertson interference, as well as promoting the maintenance of within-lineage genetic diversity. Experimental studies have demonstrated the selective advantage of outcrossing in novel environments. Here, we assess the specific role of genetic variation in the evolution of outcrossing. We experimentally evolved genetically variable and inbred populations of mixed mating (outcrossing and self-fertilizing) Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes under novel ecological conditions-specifically the presence of the virulent parasite Serratia marcescens. Outcrossing rates increased in genetically variable host populations evolved {{in the presence of the}} parasite, whereas parasite exposure in inbred populations resulted in reduced rates of host outcrossing. The host populations with genetic variation also exhibited increased fitness in the presence of the parasite over eight generations, whereas inbred populations did not. This increase in fitness was primarily the result of adaptation to the parasite, rather than recovery from initial inbreeding depression. Therefore, the benefits of outcrossing were only manifested in the presence of <b>genetic</b> variation, and <b>outcrossing</b> was favored over self-fertilization as a result.

40|$|The cestode Schistocephalus solidus is a {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodite that reproduces {{in the gut}} of birds, or for this study in an in vitro system that simulates the gut of the bird. Like many other helminth parasites, S. solidus can reproduce by self- and cross-fertilization. Hermaphrodites are expected to mate not primarily to get their own eggs fertilized, but rather to {{get the opportunity to}} fertilize a partner''s eggs. Because S. solidus has a size-dependent sex allocation (i. e., larger worms are more biased toward female allocation and produce more egg mass), we expect larger individuals to be attractive mating partners for smaller ones. However, this may be a one- directional preference, as smaller individuals may not be attractive to larger ones. We tested this experimentally by studying the reaction of focal worms of different sizes to a compartment containing a potential mating partner that was either smaller or larger than the focal worm. The focal worn-is were, on average, closer to the compartment containing the stimulus than to an empty control compartment. Moreover, they indeed showed a preference for larger stimulus worms than for smaller ones. They even tended to avoid being close to stimulus worms of very small size compared to themselves. This may reveal a general preference for cross-fertilization over selfing, but it also indicates that all the <b>genetic</b> benefits from <b>outcrossing</b> do not necessarily outweigh the costs of mating with a relatively small individual and that the worms may take this into account in their reproductive decisions...|$|R
5000|$|While it {{is often}} assumed that {{parthenogenesis}} is an inferior evolutionary strategy to sexual reproduction because parthenogenetic species lack the ability to complement <b>genetic</b> mutations through <b>outcrossing</b> or are unable to incorporate new genetic material, research on parthenogenetic species has gradually revealed a number of advantages to this mode of reproduction. Triploid unisexual geckos of the species Heteronotia binoei have greater endurance and aerobic capacity than their diploid ancestors, and this advantage {{may be the result}} of polyploidy and a form of hybrid vigor. It has also been observed that obligate parthenotes are often found at high altitudes and in sparse or marginal habitats, a pattern known as [...] "geographical parthenogenesis," [...] and their distribution in suboptimal territories may be a result of their increased colonization ability. A single parthenogenetic individual can colonize a new territory and produce offspring, while for a sexual species multiple individuals would need to occupy a new habitat and come into contact with each other for mating in order for successful colonization to occur. A parthenogenetic species can undergo a more rapid population increase than a sexual species, because all parthenotes are female and produce offspring, while in sexual species half of all individuals are males and do not give birth to offspring. Additionally, laboratory experiments have revealed that even obligate parthenotes retain the capability of incorporating new genetic material through sexual reproduction to form new parthenogenetic lineages, and the ability to outcross on occasion may explain the lengthy evolutionary persistence of some parthenogenetic species.|$|R

The high genetic diversity of A. flavus populations is {{largely due to}} sexual reproduction characterized by the formation of ascospore-bearing ascocarps embedded within sclerotia. A. flavus is heterothallic and laboratory crosses between strains of the opposite mating type produce progeny showing genetic recombination. Sclerotia formed in crops are dispersed onto the soil surface at harvest and are predominantly produced by single strains of one mating type. Less commonly, sclerotia may be fertilized during co-infection of crops with sexually compatible strains. In this study, laboratory and field experiments were performed to examine sexual reproduction in single-strain and fertilized sclerotia following exposure of sclerotia to natural fungal populations in soil. Female and male roles and mitochondrial inheritance in A. flavus were also examined through reciprocal crosses between sclerotia and conidia. Single-strain sclerotia produced ascospores on soil and progeny showed biparental inheritance that included novel alleles originating from fertilization by native soil strains. Sclerotia fertilized in the laboratory and applied to soil before ascocarp formation also produced ascospores with evidence of recombination in progeny, but only known parental alleles were detected. In reciprocal crosses, sclerotia and conidia from both strains functioned as female and male, respectively, indicating A. flavus is hermaphroditic, although the degree of fertility depended upon the parental sources of sclerotia and conidia.

Genetic diversity of the species was investigated using six allozyme systems. Allelic frequencies were scored representing eight polymorphic and five monomorphic loci. Coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst) was 0. 3019, which indicated great genetic differentiation. The number of alleles per locus was 2. 6154, the percentage of polymorphic loci was 61. 54, and the expected heterozygosity was 0. 2462 in all populations. Genetic diversity in A. maroccana was high in comparison to self-pollinated species.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 1997 Predictions of low genetic {{variation}} and {{low levels of}} inbreeding depression in small plant populations were tested on Astragalus agnicidus, a species with only one known population. Loss of alleles through drift and increased inbreeding (followed by selection) may leave small populations genetically depauperate, but with negligible genetic load as well. This scenario results in low levels of inbreeding depression as selfed and outcrossed progeny become more equivalent in overall fitness (i. e., the difference in progeny fitness between pollination treatments decreases). As predicted, gel electrophoresis of isozymes indicated that A. agnicidus has low {{genetic variation}}. Five fitness variables: seed set, seed weight, germination, survival, and seedling weight were used to test for fitness differences between open-pollinated and self-pollinated progeny. Some degree of fitness reduction for selfed progeny was seen in all variables, but only in seedling survival was the difference significant. Results indicated that the effect of the maternal parent was more important than pollination treatment on determining the fitness of an individual. Therefore, there is low enzyme diversity within the population, but genetic load is still maintained in the population and varies between individuals. The role of the mating system in influencing the level of genetic variation and inbreeding was also examined. One polymorphic enzyme, IDH, was used as the genetic marker in estimating an outcrossing rate of. 59, which indicates a mixed mating system. The advantages of a mixed mating system include maintenance of moderate levels of heterozygosity (and thus, <b>genetic</b> variation) through <b>outcrossing</b> and elimination of genetic load and retention of optimum genotypes through selfing. Evolutionary models predict that A. agnicidus, {{with a high level of}} self-compatability and an inbreeding depression level of < 50 % would evolve towards a predominantly selfing mating system. However, A. agnicidus's crossing rate remains intermediate due to an obligatory, insect mediated, tripping mechanism that virtually assures some cross-pollination in the system...|$|R

Another crucial aspect of conservation genetics for Neotropical species in fragmented landscapes is their mating systems strategies such as outcrossing and inbreeding, and conservation genetics then deals with how to maintain these systems. Cedrela odorata also known as Spanish cedar {{is an important}} tropical timber tree species which distributes widely across the continent and it‘s {{considered one of the}} main species for timber production. The objectives of the present study were: i) to assess the genetic diversity of C. odorata in primary forests and human dominated landscapes in Mesoamerica; ii) to determine and compare outcrossing rates and levels of inbreeding for the species among different levels of human dominated landscapes; and iii) to evaluate the impact of fragmentation and mother tree isolation on the <b>genetic</b> diversity and <b>outcrossing</b> parameters. Microsatellite markers for the species were developed to assess the genetic diversity and mating systems. Leave samples were collected from provenance and progeny trials established at CATIE, Turrialba. High gene diversity estimates were found for C. odorata progeny arrays, although {{no significant differences were found}} between the northern and central lineages, neither the progeny arrays of isolated mother trees nor the ones in groups or clusters. Average observed heterozigosity was 0. 78 and 20. 56 was the average number of alleles overall the samples. High multi-locus outcrossing rates (tm) were obtained for both isolation levels, 1. 00 ± 0. 08 and 1. 06 ± 0. 06 for isolation level 1 and 3, respectively, suggesting absence of self-fertilization. Isolation level analysis revealed significant differences for correlation of paternity and single locus inbreeding coefficient of maternal parents, which was higher for isolated families. An average of 5. 0 mature trees donated pollen to isolated mother trees, while 7. 7 pollen donors were found for mother trees within a ratio of 100 meters. C. odorata progenies from isolated trees have higher levels of bi-parental inbreeding, fewer pollen donors, potentially leading to a reduction of mechanisms for selective abortion among different pollen donors, and leading to a decrease in vigor of progenies. This information is significant for decision makers of the management and conservation of the species, since fertility of individual trees will depend on X the degree of isolation, human dominated habitats and availability of pollinators that may flight long distances between trees. Habitat degradation caused by selective logging has reduced the species density at natural forests, leading to common scenarios with small fragmented forests with few remnant C. odorata trees. Importance of isolated trees as stepping stones connectors between fragmented forests must be taken into account for future harvesting permits, where landscape management might be a priority for the species...|$|R

Such investigations are difficult because of its complex <b>genetic</b> makeup, and <b>outcrossing</b> with inbreeding depression. This {{study was conducted to}} understand CA in M. truncatula for determining if it {{could be used as a}} model to help dissect the genetic control of autumn yield and cold tolerance in alfalfa. Although M. truncatula has less agronomic value than alfalfa, its small genome and short generation time makes it useful as a model crop for legume genomics. Because M. truncatula is exposed to cool weather during the growing season in its native mediterranean region, it is plausible that it has evolved mechanisms to tolerate low temperatures. Assessing growth variation among M. truncatula accessions under autumn conditions is an important first step for identifying potential as a model to understand cold tolerance in alfalfa and as a winter annual forage crop. Wide variation in root and shoot dry matter accumulation revealed the presence of exploitable yield variation among M. truncatula accessions. The majority of the accessions produced higher dry matter in roots and shoots under the simulated autumn condition, patterned after 20 -years Ames 2 ̆ 7 s Iowa autumn temperature and photoperiod than in control. These results indicate that M. truncatula have considerable variation in cold tolerance abilities. Time to first flower, the only trait associated consistently with differences among geographical locations, was delayed by simulated autumn condition showing a plastic response with temperature treatments and proved a clear evidence for adaptation ability of the species to diverse locations. Cold acclimation is characterized as a biphasic process in M. truncatula based on the two distinct levels of freezing tolerance (FT) observed with response to temperatures, similar to what has been reported for winter hardy alfalfa. Simulated autumn conditions reduced stem length in M. truncatula, the response associated with fall dormancy in alfalfa. Jemalong- 6 showed higher cold tolerance than W 6 5018 with lower reduction in dry weights, stem length and number of leaves per stem and lower injury measured in CA compared to nonacclimation regimes. Differences in cold tolerance in M. truncatula may partly be related to cultivars differences in their ability to cold acclimation and indicate its possible use as a model for understanding genetics of cold tolerance in other legume crops, including alfalfa. Freezing injury occurs as a result of destabilized membranes from freeze-induced dehydration and thus, maintaining membrane stability is a key function of CA. Ion leakage test to assess injury in leaf tissues after freeze-thaw event was efficient for determining both, FT and CA ability differences in genotypes. The maximum FT was achieved with CA 3 regime, the only regime that included subzero temperature, can be used to induce maximal CA. Quantifying CA capabilities among a large number of accessions is possible using this screening procedures in future. Time course of accumulation of sugar correlates well with development of freezing tolerance in many plants. Sugars, particularly, glucose, fructose, sucrose and total sugars increased in CA regimes, reached maximum in CA 3 and correlated with FT suggesting that its contribution to membrane stability. Raffinose was only detected in cold acclimated tissues could be indicative of FT, but requires further studies to confirm if differences in its concentrations explain the genetic differences in FT among M. truncatula accessions...|$|R
