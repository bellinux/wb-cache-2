40|$|Projectors are {{increasingly}} being used as light-sources in computer vision applications. In several applications, they are modeled as point light sources, thus ignoring the effects of illumination defocus. In addition, most active vision techniques assume that a scene point is illuminated only directly by the light source, thus ignoring <b>global</b> <b>light</b> transport effects. Since both defocus and global illumination co-occur in virtually all scenes illuminated by projectors, ignoring them can result in strong, systematic biases in the recovered scene properties. To make computer vision techniques work for general real world scenes, it is thus important to account for both these effects. In this paper, we study the interplay between defocused illumination and <b>global</b> <b>light</b> transport. We show that both these seemingly disparate effects can be expressed as low pass filters on the incident illumination. Using this observation, we derive an invariant between the two effects, {{which can be used}} to separate the two. This is directly useful in scenarios where limited depth-of-field devices (such as projectors) are used to illuminate scenes with <b>global</b> <b>light</b> transport and significant depth variations. We show applications in two scenarios: (a) accurate depth recovery in the presence of <b>global</b> <b>light</b> transport, and (b) factoring out the effects of illumination defocus for correct direct-global component separation. We demonstrate our approach using scenes with complex shapes, reflectance properties, textures and translucencies...|$|R

5000|$|More {{intriguing}} techniques use SH {{to encode}} multiple functions—usually the <b>global</b> <b>lighting</b> environment and a per-vertex radiance transfer function. The generalized lighting equation involves, among other things, integrating {{the product of}} the incoming radiance and the BRDF over a sphere—something that is far too expensive for real-time rendering. But if the two functions are projected into SH coefficients, the integral of their product over the sphere is just the dot product of the two SH coefficient vectors. Generating the per-vertex transfer functions and projecting them to SH space is still an expensive process, but evaluating them is almost trivial. More to the point, they can be evaluated correctly even if the lighting environment changes in intensity or orientation. Even the most complex ray-traced radiosity algorithm can be rendered in real-time with dynamically changing lighting.|$|E

The Radiance Synthetic Imaging System delivers an excellent solution to that problem. Unfortunately, simulating complex scenes leads to long computation times even for one frame.

For a set of scenes the obtained speedup indicates the good performance of the chosen load balancing method.

40|$|Light {{interacts with}} {{the world around us}} in complex ways. These {{interactions}} can broadly be classified as direct illumination – when a scene point is illuminated directly by the light source, or indirect illumination – when a scene point receives light that is reflected, refracted or scattered off other sceneelements. Several computervision techniques make the unrealistic assumption that scenes receive only direct illumination. In many realworld scenarios, such as indoors, underground caves, underwater, foggy conditions and for objects made of translucent materials like human tissue, fruits and flowers, the amount of indirect illumination is significant, often more than the direct illumination. In these scenarios, vision techniques that do not account for the indirect illumination result in strong and systematic errors in the recovered scene properties. The above stated assumption is made because computational models for indirect illumination (also called global illumination or <b>global</b> <b>light</b> transport) are complex, even for relatively simple scenes.
