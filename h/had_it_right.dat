500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> in the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It {{was a feeling}} of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success.

I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E

60|$|Jill and I {{fixed up}} what I {{was to say}} and Jill made me say {{it over and over}} again to be sure I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> I told her--sarcastically--that she'd better say it herself and then it would be done properly. Jill said she would if it were Aunt Tommy, but when it was Dick it was better for a man to do it. So of course I agreed.|$|E

I remarked--rather wittily, as I thought--that he {{had been}} a lamb all day, but now had all of a sudden developed into a ram--battering-ram; but with dulcet frankness and simplicity he said no, a battering-ram was quite a different thing, and not in use now. This was maddening, and I came near bursting out and saying he had no more appreciation of wit than a jackass--in fact, I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> on my tongue, but did not say it, knowing there was no hurry and I could say it just as well some other time over the telephone.|$|E

The Indian saved me. Queer notions have come into my head about Yaqui. I don't {{understand}} them. He seems {{when you look at}} him only a squalid, sullen, vengeful savage. But Lord! that's far from the truth. Mebbe Yaqui's different from most Indians. He looks the same, though. Mebbe the trouble is we white folks never knew the Indian. Anyway, Beldin' <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> Yaqui's our godsend. Now as to the future, I'd like to know mebbe as well as you if we're ever to get home. Only bein' what I am, I say, Quien sabe? But somethin' tells me Yaqui knows. Ask him, Mercedes. Make him tell. We'll all be the better for knowin'. We'd be stronger for havin' more'n our faith in him. He's silent Indian, but make him tell." ...|$|E

"Rebecca'll <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> off {{the stove}} {{in half a}} minute now," [...] Mrs. Savor concluded; and from a further room came the cheerful click of cups, and then a {{wandering}} whiff of the coffee; life in its vulgar kindliness touched and made friends with death, claiming it a part of nature too.|$|R

5000|$|Former BBC Radio 4 and World Service {{broadcaster}} Robin Lustig, previously {{winner of}} 'beard of the year', also described the BBC as pogonophobic. Danny Baker of BBC Radio 5 Live disagreed and stated that: [...] "I {{really do not}} think Jeremy Paxman should be granted a beard. It's corrupt. Disney <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> Hey BBC - no news beards." [...] Baker's remark about Disney is a reference to that company's long-standing ban on employees wearing beards, only lifted in 2012 nearly sixty years after its introduction.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} in the country electorate was held one week later, on 27 August, {{in the same place}} and with another polling station in Lyttelton. In both locations, Brittan came a distant last. There were rumours at the time that Stuart-Wortley was under age; to be eligible to vote or to be elected, one had to 21 years of age. According to Burke's Peerage, he was not of full age, but the family lawyer confirmed that he was. These days, we know that Burke's Peerage <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> and Stuart-Wortley was only 20 years and 7 months old {{at the time of his}} election.|$|E

5000|$|Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization is a 2008 book by Nicholson Baker about World War II. The book {{questions}} the commonly held {{belief that the}} Allies wanted to avoid the war at all costs but were forced into action by Hitler's unrelenting crusade. It consists largely of official government transcripts, newspaper articles and other documents from the time with Baker interjecting commentary only occasionally. Baker cites documents that suggest that {{the leaders of the}} United States and the United Kingdom were provoking Germany and Japan into war and that the leaders of those two nations had ulterior motives for participating. Baker dedicates the book to American and British pacifists of the time who, in the book's epilogue, he states <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> all along: “They failed, but they were right.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Fred Schmeeckle, the namesake of the reserve, was a {{professor}} from Nebraska who taught at the Stevens Point Normal School beginning in 1923. He taught agriculture but was also a supporter of conservation education, [...] "the destruction of forests, pollution of water, and misuse of wildlife areas are factors that started me thinking something {{should be done to}} educate people in the wise use of resources." [...] In the early 1930s Schmeeckle began teaching conservation courses. This program is now the largest undergraduate natural resources program {{of its kind in the}} nation. Schmeeckle took his classes on walks and on bird watching trips to the natural area north of the campus, which is now where the reserve is located. In 1954 Schmeeckle said, [...] "Some day this area will serve as an island of green in the city of Stevens Point." [...] He <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> and his island of green is now named for him.|$|E
5000|$|Shooting {{commenced}} in July 1977 in Macclesfield in the Adelaide Hills. The {{film was}} a commercial disappointment. Director Tom Jeffrey: I screened {{the film to}} Hugh Atkinson, the writer of the novel, after we had finished it and {{he came up to}} me afterwards and I remember him saying quite clearly, [...] "You've got it." [...] I said, [...] "What do you mean?" [...] He said, [...] "You understand the ending." [...] And I still didn't know whether I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> whether I was on his wavelength, and I said, [...] "Please explain, Hugh." [...] And he said, [...] "It's about the Crucifixion." [...] And I said, [...] "Yes, well, I didn't really realise that, but if you can see that in the ending and if that's what your original intention was and I've unwittingly achieved that for you, I'm very pleased.".. The film was actually looking at the power of the group and how it can get out of hand.|$|E
