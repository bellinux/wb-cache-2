For the user, biogas provides clean cooking energy, reduces indoor air pollution, and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection, especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} use of biogas from organic residues {{in the area}} of the cities of La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia. The two cities have currently a contamination problem and biogas emerges as opportunity for both waste management and energy generation. There are approximately 274 500 tonnes/year of residue that can be used to produce biogas. This amount of residue can generate approximately 33, 500, 000 m 3 of biogas. The advantages and disadvantages of five different digester types (the smaller tubular digester, the <b>fixed</b> <b>dome</b> digester, the floating drum digester and the bigger German AEV digester and a Swedish digester) were investigated to see if they could be an option for use in Bolivia. The German AEV digester is better when compared to the Swedish unit from Flotech in case a larger biogas digester would be implemented. Among the smaller digesters, the tubular digester already has access to the necessary resources and knowledge, and they can be operated at a cheap price. The <b>fixed</b> <b>dome</b> digester and the floating drum digester are  not used in Bolivia at present, and there is no knowledge in the country about how to implement them.  There are technical, social and economic issues related to an eventual installation of a big digester in Bolivia including transportation logistics and costs, how to motivate the population to sort out the different residues, and also the state subvention of natural gas production that lowers the price of biogas required to make it competitive. To see if it is economically viable to build a functional biogas generator for this area, economic data were compared. The analysis shows that the <b>fixed</b> <b>dome</b> and floating drum digester are much better economic investment than the tube digester. The bigger digesters are economically viable without financial aid if there is a market for the by- product fertiliser in Bolivia.

40|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>dome</b> {{digester}} {{design is}} the most deployed small scale biogas technology in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). This design is deployed on mono-feedstock-wet anaerobic digestion (WAD) principle. Little or nothing {{has been reported in}} the literature on the sustainability in terms of the actual field operation and performance of this design within the SSA context. This study aims at bridging this gap and bringing additional insights to the scientific literature by investigating the sustainability of the Nepali–type <b>fixed</b> <b>dome</b> digester within the context of rural Cameroon. The investigations were evaluated in terms of operating parameters, biogas production, production rate and productivity of the digester. In addition the local investment cost of the design was analyzed. The design was operated on multiple-locally-available feedstock mixed with water at an average of 3 : 1 ratio resulting in a higher than design TS of 16 %. The design, thus was operated towards the dry anaerobic digestion principle, highlighting insufficient mono-feedstock and water scarcity for a sustainable operation of the design within the context of rural SSA. The average biogas production was 1. 2  m 3 biogas/day, giving average volumetric production rate of 0. 16  m 3 biogas/m 3 digester day− 1 and yields of 0. 18  m 3 biogas/kg VS respectively. This low performance compared with the potential mesophilic biogas production rate of 0. 27  m 3 biogas/m 3 digester day− 1 could be linked to insufficient mixing of digester content and low operating temperatures.

40|$|The {{research}} of alternative fuels implemented in internal combustion engines are becoming {{the subjects of}} interest nowadays. This paper describes a production of biogas from cow dung, diesel engine conversion process with piston modification of ZH 1115 diesel engine. To produce biogas, the usual practice is to mix water with some organic material, such as cow dung (a free source of the appropriate micro-organisms). The slurry is placed in a leak-proof container (called a digester) and leaves it to ferment. After several days at suitable temperature, sufficient methane will have formed to make a combustible gas. <b>Fix</b> <b>dome</b> type of biogas plant is chosen in this gas production for cost saving and to produce sufficient gas at lower temperature. The biogas engine which are modified from diesel engine emphases the ignition system, gas governing and carburetion systems along with a change in compression ratio, in some cases also {{a change in the}} combustion chamber. Since diesel engine cannot be operated by biogas alone, this paper covers the conversion of diesel to spark ignition engine i. e. conversion of four stroke of ZH 1115 diesel engine to biogas engine based on 30 biogas inlet holes which was recommended by the experienced designers. This paper also describes methods of reducing compression ratio, changing ignition system with timing and fueling system, the comparisons of technical parameters and performance between ZH 1115 diesel engine and converted biogas engine. It describes the criteria of technological selections, engineering aspects and short term and long term plans for lighting. The goal to develop and implement BIOGAS engine and use biogas as the renewable energy and bio-fertilizer is to control pollution, to protect environment, to develop rural area and also to reach the ambitious emissions goals and to reduce dependence on imported foreign oil...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ancient Stupas in Sri Lanka {{are solid}} structures, mostly {{composed}} of burnt bricks. Some of them {{date back to}} the third century BC, and some attained gigantic proportions, making them the largest brick structures in the world. At the turn of the 19 th century AD all of the ancient stupas were in ruins, covered with vegetation. Initially rehabilitation of these stupas were attempted in haphazard ways, but presently modern principles of archaeological heritage management are applied to the conservation and restoration of these historical structures. Mirisaveti stupa (2 nd century BC) is a good example for a complete restoration. It had only the cracked dome {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century after repairs by the British, and an ill planned restoration in 1987 resulted in a collapse of the stupa. After a thorough study the stupa was restored to its original form in 1995. In the case of Jetavana (3 rd century AD) a conservation rather than a full restoration is presently done. The dome, which is covered with vegetation, is cleaned and a new layer of brick is added on top of ancient bricks. The square chamber has to undergo major repairs as some parts of it had suffered serious damage. In the case of Tissamaharama (2 nd century BC), equally spaced meridional cracks appeared on the surface of the dome towards its mid height due to hoop tension.
