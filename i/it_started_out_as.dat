Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it himself. The blog is named after his favorite stage in embryonic development, the pharyngula stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs, a project of Seed Magazine, in 2005.|$|E

The Neponset tribe officially claimed the area that is now Walpole, {{and some of its}} surrounding territory in 1635. The town of Dedham was not included in this claim, so they began to negotiate with the Neponset tribe to gain land. In 1636, a deal was made between the town of Dedham and the Neponsets to grant Dedham lands that now comprise the towns of Walpole, Norwood, Westwood, Medfield, Norfolk and Dover as well as Dedham. The land given to Dedham in this deal currently includes parts of 16 different towns.|$|E

500|$|Boogaloo {{is both a}} {{style of}} dance and a style of music. <b>It</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a fad dance, and several songs were {{released}} in the 1960s celebrating it including [...] "Boogaloo Down Broadway", [...] "My Baby Likes to Boogaloo", [...] "Hey You! Boo-Ga-Loo", [...] "Do the Boogaloo", [...] "Boogaloo #3", and [...] "Sock Boogaloo". In response to this song-and-dance craze, Puerto Rican artists in New York City created a style of music called Bugalú (or Latin boogaloo) that combined mambo, soul, and R. Singer Joe Cuba was a pioneer of this style.|$|E

He transforms into a beast in the bathroom, and bursts out, causing the plane to crash in Scarsdale, New York. The Fringe team arrives {{on the scene and}} discover the beast's body. Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) concludes that <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a human. Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) recognizes Bowman's picture from John Scott's (Mark Valley) memories, realizing that Bowman was flying to meet another man in the memories named Daniel Hicks (Felix Solis). Back at the lab at Harvard, Walter finds a small crystalline disc implanted in the beast's hand similar to one seen inside the woman killed in [...] "The Ghost Network", and thinks Marshall was dosed with a [...] "designer virus".|$|E

The team that is successful in beating all of the opposing teams is awarded the Cup.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time {{breaking}} was developing in New York, other styles were being created in California. The funk styles refers to several street dance styles created in California in the 1970s such as roboting, bopping, hitting, locking, bustin', popping, electric boogaloo, strutting, sac-ing, and dime-stopping. Out {{of all of these}} dances, boogaloo is one of the oldest. <b>It</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a 1960s fad dance and was the subject of several songs released during that time such as [...] "Do the Boogaloo" [...] and [...] "My Baby Likes to Boogaloo". From being a fad, it developed into a dance style called electric boogaloo and a music genre called Latin boogaloo. The most popular and widely practiced of the funk styles are locking and popping. The television show Soul Train played a large role in giving these styles commercial exposure. Both The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos—dance crews responsible for the spread of locking and popping—performed on this show.|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Roy McComb (Zak Orth) confesses to his priest {{that he sees}} visions of bad things, {{including}} a bus where {{everyone is going to}} die. Simultaneously with this scene, a man enters a bus, unleashes a canister emitting gaseous fumes, and steals a backpack before quickly getting off. The Fringe team arrives soon after, only to find the fumes have hardened into an amber-like substance, trapping and killing those inside. Walter (John Noble) studies the substance and concludes <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a gas and then solidified, suffocating the passengers. While looking at a victim's video footage, Olivia (Anna Torv) discovers a backpack is missing, and traces it back to one of the victims, a Federal employee with undercover connections to a drug cartel. They interview her [...] "handler", who comes to identify her body. The Fringe team finds out about Roy, and search through his apartment, believing he is behind the bus and other Pattern-related terror attacks. They soon realize all of his drawings are dated before the incidents took place, despite the fact that several of them were never made public. In an interrogation, Roy tells Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) he's been receiving his visions for nine months, roughly when they began seeing Pattern-related attacks.|$|E
500|$|Hip-hop {{dance is}} a broad {{category}} that includes a variety of styles. The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock, breaking, and the funk styles. Breaking was created in The Bronx, New York, incorporating dances that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s in African-American and Latino communities. In its earliest form, it began as [...] on James Brown's [...] "Good Foot" [...] dance which came out in 1972. Breaking at this period was not primarily floor-oriented as seen today; <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> toprock which dancers perform while standing up. An influence on toprock was uprock which was created in Brooklyn, New York. Uprock looks similar to toprock, {{but it is more}} aggressive and looks like a fight. Uprock is also performed with partners, but in toprock—and in breaking in general—each person takes turns dancing. In 1973, DJ Kool Herc invented the break beat. A break beat is a rhythmic, musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo. Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills. B-boy and b-girl stands for [...] "break-boy" [...] and [...] "break-girl"; b-boys and b-girls dance to the break of a record. Further influenced by martial arts and gymnastics, breaking went from being a purely upright dance style—toprock only—to becoming more floor-oriented.|$|E

[...] Kim Newman from Empire Magazine also endorsed the film, writing, [...] "... delivers all the Saturday night whiz-bang and Sunday morning brain-ripping you could want." [...] The Suns Alex Zane stated that [...] "while <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> just a Cloverfield/Independence Day pastiche, this turns into something almost brilliant." ...|$|R
50|$|The embryo {{spends the}} next few days {{traveling}} down the Fallopian tube. <b>It</b> <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a single cell zygote and then divides several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. Further cellular division is accompanied by the formation of a small cavity between the cells. This stage is called a blastocyst. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the zona pellucida. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells.|$|R
50|$|Thomson {{structures}} or Widmanstätten {{patterns are}} created as the meteorite cools; at high temperatures both iron and nickel have face-centered lattices. When the meteorite is formed <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> entirely molten taenite (greater than 1500 ˚C) {{and as it}} cools past 723 ˚C the primary metastable phase of the alloy changes into taenite and kamacite begins to precipitate out. It is in this window where the meteorite is cooling below 723 ˚C where the Thomson structures form {{and they can be}} greatly affected by the temperature, pressure, and composition of the meteorite.|$|R
500|$|In South Slavic folklore, {{a vampire}} was {{believed}} to pass through several distinct stages in its development. The first 40 days were considered decisive for {{the making of a}} vampire; <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> an invisible shadow and then gradually gained strength from the lifeblood of the living, forming a (typically invisible) jelly-like, boneless mass, and eventually building up a human-like body nearly identical to the one the person had had in life. This development allowed the creature to ultimately leave its grave and begin a new life as a human. The vampire, who was usually male, was also sexually active and could have children, either with his widow or a new wife. These could become vampires themselves, but could also have a special ability to see and kill vampires, allowing them to become vampire hunters.The same talent {{was believed to}} be found in persons born on Saturday. In the Dalmatian region of Croatia, there is a female vampire called a Mora or Morana, who drinks the blood of men, and also the kuzlac/kozlak who are the recent-dead [...] "who have not lived piously." [...] They can be men or women who show themselves at crossroads, bridges, caves, and graveyards and frighten the locals by terrorizing their homes and drinking their blood. To be killed, a wooden stake must be thrust through them. In Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, a type of vampire called pijavica, which literally translates to [...] "leech", is used to describe a vampire who has led an evil and sinful life as a human and in turn, becomes a powerfully strong, cold-blooded killer. Incest, especially between mother and son, is one {{of the ways in which}} a pijavica can be created, and then it usually comes back to victimize its former family, who can only protect their homes by placing mashed garlic and wine at their windows and thresholds to keep it from entering. It can only be killed by fire while awake and by using the Rite of Exorcism if found in its grave during the day. In Bulgaria from the Middle Ages through to the beginning of the 20th century, it was a common practice to pin corpses through the heart with an iron stake to prevent their return as a vampire.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Royal Navy, the English navy had no defined moment of formation; <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a motley assortment of [...] "King's ships" [...] during the Middle Ages assembled only as needed and then dispersed, began to take shape as a standing navy during the 16th century, and became a regular establishment during the tumults of the 17th century. [...] The Navy grew considerably during the global struggle with France that started in 1690 and culminated in the Napoleonic Wars, a time when the practice of fighting under sail was developed to its highest point.|$|E

Stackpole went through 50 renditions before settling upon the final model which was 10 ft tall. The model was then divided into cross sections. Each cross section was enlarged eight-fold though a process using a pantograph. Scaffolding was set up and prepared for the precise assembly of the enlarged sections. Iron was used for supports, bent and shaped around the proper contours of the statue. Next, mesh wire was layered over the entire iron frame, and then covered in a final blanket of plaster. Such a construction was always meant for temporary placement.|$|R
