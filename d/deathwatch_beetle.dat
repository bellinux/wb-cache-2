25|$|In the 1950s, {{a number}} of {{preventive}} measures were instigated, including the removal of bulkheads to increase airflow and the fumigating of the ship against the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle.</b> The following decade saw the replacement {{of much of the}} decayed oak with oily hardwoods such as teak and Iroko, which were believed to be more resistant to fungus and pests. The decision to restore Victory to her Battle of Trafalgar configuration was taken in 1920, but the need to undertake these important repairs meant this was not achieved until 2005, in time for the Trafalgar 200 celebrations. Victorys foretopsail was severely damaged during the Battle of Trafalgar, perforated by upwards of 90 cannonballs and other projectiles. It was replaced after the battle, but was preserved and eventually displayed in the Royal Naval Museum.|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th {{century the}} {{population}} of Keynsham grew, {{partly due to the}} construction of the Somerdale Factory. Douglas Percival Hatchard, who had taken over as the vicar in 1901, [...] continued work on the church school and raised money for the restoration of the church. Heating was provided by the Keynsham Electric Light Company from their plant next to the church. The mission church at Chewton Keynsham continued as a dependent chapel and was often served by lay readers. After World War I a memorial was built. The vicar during World War II was Vernon Graham Havergal Shaw. He was pacifist which brought him into conflict with members of the church council and churchwardens as they thought prayers should be said for the troops, however the vicar disagreed. He left the parish in 1945 and was replaced by Trevor Wright, who was in charge when further problems were uncovered in the church during the 1950s. The woodwork was affected by <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> and wet rot and repair work costing over £15,000 was needed. Mervyn Wedgewood took over as the vicar in 1956 as the town expanded further. He led the establishment of new classes and groups for the population and {{the construction of a new}} church dedicated to St Francis. The old church rooms were demolished to make way for a bypass, in the 1960s and the compensation money used for the construction of a new church hall and vicarage. During the 1970s a team ministry was established.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{developed}} by the Dow Chemical Company, sulfuryl fluoride is in widespread use as a structural fumigant insecticide to control drywood termites, particularly in warm-weather portions of the southwestern and southeastern United States and in Hawaii. Less commonly, {{it can also be}} used to control rodents, powderpost <b>beetles,</b> <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles,</b> bark beetles, and bedbugs. Its use has increased as a replacement for methyl bromide, which was phased out because of harm to the ozone layer. It is an alternative to the use of phosphine, which is acutely toxic.|$|R
40|$|<b>Deathwatch</b> <b>beetles</b> produce taps, by {{drumming}} {{the head}} on the substrate, which enable males to locate females. The orientation mechanism used by males was examined experimentally using a mechanical tapper to simulate female replies. When searching for a female, males moved short distances before stopping to tap, tapped {{only once or twice}} if they got a reply, and turned frequently. In the absence of replies males moved longer distances before stopping to tap, and turned less. Males did not use tropotaxis during mate location, but exhibited a weak klinokinesis. Their turn angles tended to be larger when {{a long way from the}} female, and following a movement away from the female, so that they turned back towards it. However, the mechanism is not efficient as many males studied failed to locate the female. Mechanisms for the evolution of this unusual mate- locating system are discussed in the context of the recently available artificial habitat occupied by <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Xestobium rufovillosum, is a woodboring beetle. The adult beetle is 7 mm long, {{while the}} {{xylophagous}} larvae {{are up to}} 11 mm long.|$|E
50|$|The church {{dates from}} the 12th century. The chancel roof was {{restored}} around 1895 and the nave roof, found to be infested with <b>Deathwatch</b> <b>beetle,</b> was restored in 1925.|$|E

40|$|In {{a choice}} {{bio-assay}} adult female <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles</b> were offered two dendrochronologically dated wood blocks from oak timber to study oviposition preference behaviour. There {{was a clear}} preference for ovipositing on old wood dating from the 13 th to 19 th centuries rather than new wood from the 20 th century. Control, same-century choice, experiments showed that beetles will oviposit on young wood and that {{the age of the}} wood does not alter the overall oviposition potential. Oviposition frequency varied with insect age. Fecundity of insects collected from an infested building was similar to that of insects maintained in culture...|$|R

Cyber's adamantium carapace, which remains untouched, is then used in an unsuccessful attempt to re-implant adamantium onto Wolverine's skeleton by Genesis, leader of the Dark Riders.|$|R
500|$|In 1929, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} a Supervisor in Mechanical Sciences at St John's College. He {{was appointed}} a Supervisor in Physics in 1931, and in 1933 became the junior bursar, making him {{responsible for the}} upkeep of the buildings, {{many of which were}} suffering from neglect. The college gatehouse had to be partly taken down in order to repair damage done by <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles,</b> and Cockcroft supervised rewiring of the electrics. [...] In 1935, Rutherford appointed him the {{director of research at the}} Mond Laboratory vice Kapitza, who had returned to the Soviet Union. He supervised the installation of new cryogenic equipment, and supervised low temperature research. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936, and in 1939 was elected the Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy, effective 1 October 1939.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} of the house by 1979 {{was so bad that}} it was in danger of collapsing. The foundations had sunk, among other structural problems. In addition to this, woodworm and dry and wet rot had set in, and the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> was rife.|$|E
5000|$|Anobiidae is {{a family}} of beetles. The larvae {{of a number of}} species tend to bore into wood, earning them the name [...] "woodworm" [...] or [...] "wood borer". A few species are pests, causing damage to wooden {{furniture}} and house structures, notably the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Xestobium rufovillosum, and the common furniture beetle, Anobium punctatum.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several restorations. In 1879 the west window was renewed and other repairs executed, {{including}} work to the roofs of the nave and aisles, which were stripped and rebolted. The chancel roof, which had suffered severely from the ravages of the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle,</b> was reconstructed in 1933. At {{the apex of the}} spire is a weather-vane.|$|E
40|$|Adult {{females of}} Xestobium rufovillosum de Geer {{demonstrated}} anemotactic orientation {{when exposed to}} an odor plume containing volatiles generated by wood-decaying fungi (Coriolus versicolor, Donkioporia expansa) and decayed oak wood (Quercus petraea, Quercus robur). They did not orient towards undecayed oak wood, beech (Fagus sylvatica), or pine wood (Pinus sylvestris). Although all insects tested showed anemotactic orientation, responses were nonlinear with respect to insect age. Adult females more readily oriented upwind when they were between 10 and 16 days old. Oviposition choice bioassays showed that ovipositing females would preferentially oviposit on extract-treated cellulose paper discs that had been treated with various strains of the wood-decaying fungus, Donkioporia expansa. HPLC-fractionated mycelial extracts were attractive to ovipositing <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles,</b> whereas HPLC-fractionated fungal broth extracts were repellent to ovipositing females. The implications of these results {{are discussed in the}} context of timber pest management in historically important buildings...|$|R
50|$|Cyber is next seen back in Edinburgh, Scotland {{where he}} again engages Wolverine in battle. Recalling {{his part in}} the West Port murders long ago, he announces his {{intention}} to kill Wolverine and feed him to the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles</b> to steal his adamantium skeleton. However, Cyber is unaware that the adamantium laced to Wolverine's skeleton has been recently removed by Magneto. Despite this, {{and despite the fact}} that many of Wolverine's other mutant attributes were weakened, he manages to hold his own against Cyber briefly. Cyber is momentarily distracted by the distant cannon fire of Edinburgh Castle as Wolverine extracts his bone claws and slashes Cyber across the face. Cyber, unimpressed by the attack and annoyed by this turn of events, quickly slams Wolverine to the ground and uses his foot to break the bone claws off of Wolverine's right arm before their fight is interrupted, allowing Wolverine the opportunity to escape Cyber once more. Using his amplified brain-wave tracking power, he chases the poisoned Logan to Muir Island, where he is eventually outsmarted by Kitty Pride and captured by Excalibur.|$|R
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetles</b> found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|R
50|$|To attract mates, these woodborers {{create a}} tapping or ticking sound {{that can be}} heard in the rafters of old {{buildings}} on quiet summer nights. They are therefore associated with quiet, sleepless nights and are named for the vigil (watch) kept beside the dying or dead, and by extension the superstitious have seen the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> as an omen of impending death.|$|E
5000|$|In 1838 Henry David Thoreau {{published}} an essay mentioning the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle.</b> It {{is possible that}} this essay influenced Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] and that the sound the protagonist was hearing {{at the end of}} that story was that of a beetle tapping inside the wall, not the beating of the (dead) victim's heart.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, the National Trust {{began an}} ambitious {{conservation}} project that involved dismantling {{much of the}} building and recording its construction methods before rebuilding it. During this process, the effects of centuries of ageing, weathering, and the destructive effect of the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> were highlighted. The project ended in 2004 after revealing numerous examples of structural and ornamental features which had been covered up by later additions.|$|E
50|$|The bridge's trusses, floor beams, ties, {{and lateral}} bracing systems are framed {{almost entirely of}} Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus), a species {{typically}} favored for wooden bridge framing {{in areas of the}} country where it was found, for its strength-to-weight ratio. So favored for this purpose, it was commonly imported into areas where it was unavailable as an indigenous species (minimizing dead load a strategy for increasing capacity for live load). Original rafters were quite easily identifiable from those replaced after the 1958 roof collapse, and were (as are the newly replicated replacements) framed with tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), also a lightweight species favored by the bridgewrighting community where available. Replicated rafters, like their predecessors, are tapered over their length, one inch wider at their tail than at the ridge. This was likely not an esthetic choice, but done as part of an overall strategy to minimize dead load. The original floor beams were replaced sometime in the 1920s, the bridges final decade of service, with mixed species ash and oak. This was an attempt to increase load capacity. The only original white pine floorbeam to escape replacement was the one found at the centerline of truss, which was tenoned through the king post at midspan. All others were bolted to the sides of their adjacent posts, and were easily replaced. This strategy seems to have failed (the bridge was bypassed in the following decade) and the additional weight was {{part of the reason why}} the bridge's framing became severely distorted in the decades of neglect to follow. These hardwood replacements had heavy infestations of <b>deathwatch</b> and powderpost <b>beetles</b> (Bostrichoidea) and were again replaced with timbers of appropriate species in the recently completed restoration.|$|R
50|$|Insects and pests {{can destroy}} woodblock prints by eating through the paper or leaving {{droppings}} that stain the paper. A {{common cause of}} holes in Japanese woodblock prints is the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> (Xestobium rufovillosum). These beetles were commonly found in wood used to build furniture in the Edo period. Woodblock prints that were stored on bookshelves, or other furniture infested with these beetles, also became infested themselves.|$|E
50|$|The fan {{vaulting}} {{was installed}} in the 1950s after the wooden roof (there was no money for a vault to be installed in the 15th century after King Henry VI was deposed) became infested with <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle.</b> It was completed in three years and is made of concrete, faced with stone, supported by steel trusses, with hand-carved Clipsham stone for the stone ribs supporting each bay.|$|E

Major restoration was undertaken in the 19th century when the porch was rebuilt and the height of the tower increased. Much of the woodwork in the church was carved by local craftsmen. In 1964 the roof had to be replaced because of <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle.</b> Inside the church is a 15th-century iron bound chest which was used to secure the plate and other valuables of the church.

5000|$|The narrator {{claims to}} have a disease that causes hypersensitivity. A similar motif is used for Roderick Usher in [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] (1839) and in [...] "The Colloquy of Monos and Una" [...] (1841). It is unclear, however, if the narrator {{actually}} has very acute senses, or if he is merely imagining things. If his condition {{is believed to be}} true, what he hears {{at the end of the}} story may not be the old man's heart but deathwatch beetles. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds. Henry David Thoreau observed in an 1838 article that deathwatch beetles make sounds similar to a heartbeat. The beating could even be the sound of the narrator's own heart. Alternatively, if the beating is really a product of the narrator's imagination, it is that uncontrolled imagination that leads to his own destruction.|$|E

30|$|While {{there is}} a {{potential}} for insects to increase as a result of climate change [38], future trends can be hard to detect and additionally influenced by food and habitat availability [39]. Although {{there is a}} potential for invasive species, there are also worries about the impact of climate change and urbanization reducing bees and butterflies [40] and in Japan dragonflies also [41]. There is little information about the temperature and relative humidity relevant to the development of anobiids found at Nikkō, typically causing a faster rate of growth and higher rates of reproduction. However, it is possible to approximate these through comparison with the tolerances observed by Fisher [42] in his studies of the <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> some 80  years ago. He made laboratory studies of the egg development time, number of eggs and their viability as a function of relative humidity and temperature. Once the relative humidity is greater than 40 %, it has little effect on the rate of development of the eggs. Temperatures between about 15 and 25  °C seem suitable for development of the eggs are typically required for the egg stage [43].|$|E
30|$|On {{its eastern}} side the Hall {{contains}} {{one of the}} most significant libraries in the National Trust, filled with Sir Richard Ellys’s books [13]. Ellys’s library was installed in 1745 in the Long Gallery [18], one of the finest rooms at Blickling with its elaborately decorated Jacobean plaster ceiling, has been the principle focus for content conservation for some years within the house. The library is known to suffer on and off from mould growth on leather and vellum book bindings, notably at the back of the books, where temperature may be lower due to radiant heat loss from the external walls. In the 1980 s, the presses were altered by extending the depth of the shelves so that ventilation holes could be drilled at the back of the shelves to facilitate ventilation behind the book stack and mitigate mould growth. However, occasional mould growth still occurs. Another significant issue within the library is <b>deathwatch</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation, of the textblock of books and wooden structural elements, especially at the North end of the library. This may be related to poor environmental conditions inside the library at this time, as well as past water ingress, such as flooding caused by failure of rainwater goods that was discovered in 1999. Water-soaked or decayed timber is vulnerable to insect attack [19 – 21]. Since these events, the National Trust has made considerable effort to prevent water ingress through repair and maintenance of the building fabric and rainwater goods. In the Long Gallery itself heating is used to prevent high humidity conditions that can encourage mould growth and insect infestation, aiming to keep indoor relative humidity level below about 60 %. The North East Turret is also subject to death watch beetle infestation, due to a long history of water ingress affecting its timbers. For all these reasons, with the aim of identifying and quantifying the environmental exposure, Blickling Hall was monitored between August 2012 and October 2014 using an extensive monitoring system, which is described in detail below. This paper summarizes the findings of this monitoring study and discusses the susceptibility of the building envelope to moisture-induced damage.|$|E
