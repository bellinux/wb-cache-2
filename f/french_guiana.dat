5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{native to}} {{tropical}} northern and central South America. It {{is present in the}} drainages of the Orinoco River, the São Francisco River and the Amazon River, and {{the upper reaches of the}} Paraná River and the Paraguay River. The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The range of this species is rather larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into Paraguay and includes a larger area of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, the cane toad had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela. It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} the wedge head caiman by the pet trade.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of membranophones used in the Caribbean music area, {{including}} the islands of the Caribbean Sea, as well as the musics of Guyana, Suriname, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> Belize, Garifuna music, and Bermuda. It only includes membranophones that are indigenous to the local music area or are a vital and long-standing part of local culture. It does not include membranophones that are, for example, a part of Western style orchestras, nor does it include trap sets and other common membranophones used in popular music recordings of many genres across the world. Almost all membranophones are drums and percussion instruments.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed by a ship about 835mi (1,345km) northeast of Cayenne, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> early on August6, according to historic weather maps. However, {{the scarcity of}} observations means that its genesis may have occurred earlier than this time and been undetected operationally. With initial winds of 60mph (95km/h), the system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale about 24hours later. The first indication of the storm {{to the east of}} Barbados was on August8 via telegraph reports. Early on August9, the cyclone struck Martinique as either a strong Category1 or a weak Category2 hurricane. The storm entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Around 12:00UTC, the cyclone intensified into a Category3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the second storm of 1900 and the first in the Caribbean Sea since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars were {{therefore}} ones in which Britain invested {{large amounts of}} capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy, which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, {{including those of the}} Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815. Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony. Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815).|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese Royal Family in Rio de Janeiro in 1808 changed {{the lives of the}} Lima family. King Dom João VI {{embarked}} upon a series of wars of conquest which resulted in the expansion of Brazil's territory with the annexation of Cisplatina to the south and of <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> to the north. By 1818, Luís Alves' relatives, who were military officers and had served in the wars, had been ennobled. His grandfather, José Joaquim, {{became a member of the}} Order of Christ and Fidalgo Cavaleiro da Casa Real (Knight Nobleman of the Royal House). His father, Francisco de Lima, and uncles were also granted honors. Within two generations, the Lima family had risen from mere commoners to the ranks of Portugal's untitled nobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded introductions were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados introductions {{were focused}} on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and mole cricket populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no {{significant effect on the}} rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on Antiguapossibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufrière Hills volcano eruption in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Troude's {{squadron}} {{to escape the}} British pursuit highlights {{the dominance of the}} Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies. Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had no alternative but to wait for the inevitable British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso {{style is}} an {{especially}} potent part of {{the music of the}} other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar {{has been}} an American cat since {{crossing}} the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene epoch; the immediate ancestor of modern animals is Panthera onca augusta, which was larger than the contemporary cat. Its present range extends from Mexico, through Central America and into South America, including much of Amazonian Brazil. The countries included in this range are Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica (particularly on the Osa Peninsula), Ecuador, <b>French</b> <b>Guiana,</b> Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, the United States and Venezuela. The jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. It occurs in the 400km² Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, the 5,300km² Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, the approximately 15,000km2 Manú National Park in Peru, the approximately 26,000km2 Xingu National Park in Brazil, and numerous other reserves throughout its range.|$|E
