40|$|Background: The virus-specific {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) induction is {{an important}} target {{for the development of}} a broadly protective <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine,</b> since most CTL epitopes are found on internal viral proteins and relatively conserved. In this study, the possibility of developing a strain/subtype-independent <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> was explored by taking a bioinformatics approach to establish an immunogenic HLA-A 24 restricted CTL epitope screening system in HLAtransgenic mice. Methodology/Principal Findings: HLA-A 24 restricted CTL epitope peptides derived from internal proteins of the H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus were predicted by CTL epitope peptide prediction programs. Of 35 predicted peptides, six peptides exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activity in vivo. More than half of the mice which were subcutaneously vaccinated with the three most immunogenic and highly conserved epitopes among three different influenza A virus subtypes (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2 and H 5 N 1) survived lethal influenza virus challenge during both effector and memory CTL phases. Furthermore, mice that were intranasally vaccinated with these peptides remained free of clinical signs after lethal virus challenge during the effector phase. Conclusions/Significance: This CTL epitope peptide selection system can be used as an effective tool {{for the development of a}} cross-protective <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Furthermore this vaccine strategy can be applicable to the development o...|$|R

40|$|Influenza {{infection}} {{is a wide}} spread disease of the respiratory tract. Strategies to control influenza outbreaks are mainly focused on prophylactic vaccination. Commonly available <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are trivalent blends. Therefore and due to annual adaptations, strain independent manufacturing processes are required for vaccine production. This study verifies the strain independency of a capturing method based on Euonymus europaeus lectin-affinity chromatography (EEL-AC) for downstream processing of influenza viruses propagated in MDCK cells under various culture conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive lectin binding screening was conducted for two influenza virus types from season 2007 / 2008 (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005, B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) including a comparison of virus lectin association by surface plasmon resonance technology. EEL-AC resulted in a reproducible high product recovery rate and {{a high degree of}} contaminant removal in the case of both MDCK cell-derived influenza virus types clearly demonstrating the general applicability of EEL-AC. In addition, differences in virus purification based on host cell selection were studied for MDCK and Vero cells, which are considered for industrial vaccine production. However, the choice of the host cell lines is known to lead to differences in product glycosylation profiles. Hence, altered lectin specificities have been observed between the two cell lines, requiring process adaptations between different influenza vaccine production systems. Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.

In this study, a seasonal trivalent VLP vaccine (TVV) formulation, composed of influenza A H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 and influenza B VLPs, was evaluated in mice and ferrets for the ability to elicit antigen-specific immune responses.

HAI titers elicited by the TVV were statistically similar to HAI titers elicited in animals vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent VLP. Mice vaccinated with the TVV had higher level of influenza specific CD 8 + T cell responses than a commercial trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV).

40|$|The highly {{abundant}} and strongly immunogenic influenza envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) represents {{the main component of}} influenza vaccines. <b>Human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are typically produced in embryonated chicken eggs. In addition, cell culture-derived vaccine production systems {{are currently being}} established. Since characteristics of glycoproteins such as the HA can be significantly influenced by N-glycosylation, the impact of host cells considered for vaccine manufacturing needs to be addressed. In this study MDCK cell-derived influenza A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) virus was adapted over four passages in AGE 1. CR. pIX-cells. HA N-glycosylation patterns (normalized capillary electropherograms) were determined and analyzed using capillary gel electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (each peak represents at least one distinct N-glycan structure). During the adaptation to AGE 1. CR. pIX-cells, virus titers 24 hours post infection improved. HA N-glycosylation patterns of MDCK and AGE 1. CR. pIX-derived virus particles differed significantly after the first adaptation step. This clearly suggests that the structure of the viral antigens is strongly influenced by the host cell. Furthermore, AGE 1. CR. pIX-derived antigens showed a tendency towards small glycans. Differences between glycan patterns of the four successive passages in AGE 1.

40|$|Abstract—Evidence from {{cohort studies}} and a {{randomized}} clinical trial indicates that annual vaccination against seasonal influenza prevents cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality {{in patients with}} cardiovascular conditions. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology recommend influenza immunization with inactivated vaccine (administered intramuscularly) as part of comprehensive secondary prevention in persons with coronary and other atherosclerotic vascular disease (Class I, Level B). Immunization with live, attenuated vaccine (administered intranasally) is contraindicated for persons with cardiovascular conditions. It {{is important to note}} that influenza vaccination coverage levels overall and in this population remain well below national goals and are marked by disparities across different age and ethnic groups.

40|$|State-of-the-art <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are {{manufactured}} by using mammalian host cells for virus propagation. During this process, the virus utilises the replication machinery {{of each individual}} cell to synthesise viral RNA and proteins. Each virus strain shows specific replication dynamics depending on its success to control the host cell machinery. However, the propagation of infection in the host cell population also determines the overall virus yield. Understanding this multiscale process to predict a strain's production performance and to optimise yields requires a coherent mathematical model emphasising both the individual cell level and the cell population level. Here, we present a quantitative model for the infection of individual Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which is validated against real-time RT-qPCR data. Analysing {{the time course of}} viral RNA synthesis reveals strain-specific replication dynamics and allows testing hypotheses concerning the influenza virus reproduction cycle. By extending this single cell approach to a heterogeneous population of cells, the impact of these strain-specific differences in virus replication can be investigated with respect to the process level. With the resulting multiscale model and flow cytometric measurements, infection status and apoptosis induction in a cell population are interpreted {{in the context of a}} strain's production performance. This approach elucidates an inherent trade-off between a rapid production of viral RNAs and proteins, and an early induction of apoptosis triggered by the accumulation of these components. Such knowledge can contribute significantly to our understanding of the quantitative aspects of virus-host cell interaction and to the development of new concepts for the optimization of vaccine production...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} current {{influenza}} vaccines being immunogenic, {{evolution of the}} influenza virus can reduce efficacy and so influenza remains {{a major threat to}} public health. One approach to improve influenza vaccines is to include adjuvants; substances that boost the immune response. Adjuvants are particularly beneficial for influenza vaccines administered during a pandemic when a rapid response is required or for use in patients with impaired immune responses, such as infants and the elderly. This review outlines the current use of adjuvants in <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> including what they are, why they are used and what is known of their mechanism of action. To date, six adjuvants have been used in licensed human vaccines: Alum, MF 59, AS 03, AF 03, virosomes and heat labile enterotoxin (LT). In general these adjuvants are safe and well tolerated, but there have been some rare adverse events when adjuvanted vaccines are used at a population level that may discourage the inclusion of adjuvants in influenza vaccines, for example the association of LT with Bell's Palsy. Improved understanding about the mechanisms of the immune response to vaccination and infection has led to advances in adjuvant technology and we describe the experimental adjuvants that have been tested in clinical trials for influenza but have not yet progressed to licensure. Adjuvants alone are not sufficient to improve influenza vaccine efficacy because they do not address the underlying problem of mismatches between circulating virus and the vaccine. However, they may contribute to improved efficacy of next-generation influenza vaccines and will most likely {{play a role in the}} development of effective universal influenza vaccines, though what that role will be remains to be seen...|$|E
30|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} systems vaccinology in humans was further extended by studies on immunity to <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) (Nakaya et al. 2011; Bucasas et al. 2011; Franco et al. 2013), and LAIV (FluMist) (Nakaya et al. 2011). TIV {{is the most}} common flu shot vaccine, which is a mixture of inactivated split H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, and influenza B vaccines. To determine whether molecular signatures after YF- 17 D vaccination would be similar to other vaccines such as influenza, a recent study carried out a systems analysis of responses to TIV and LAIV in young healthy adults during three consecutive influenza seasons (Nakaya et al. 2011). The group of people who received TIV showed higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts compared to the group who received nasal spray of LAIV. As expected from the fact that replicating LAIV infects mucosal tissues of respiratory tracts, humans with a nasal spray of LAIV showed a robust type I IFN antiviral transcriptomic signatures. TIV-vaccinated humans also expressed some gene encoding type I interferons and related proteins as well as gene encoding proinflammatory mediators (Nakaya et al. 2011). In this study, genes that are involved in innate sensing of viruses and antiviral responses were highly expressed within 1 to 3 days after vaccination of humans (Nakaya et al. 2011). After 3 to 7 days of vaccination, the up-regulated genes (TNRSF 17, XBP- 1) were found {{to be involved in the}} differentiation of plasmablasts, which is likely to be correlated with the magnitude of the later hemagglutin titers (Nakaya et al. 2011). Other studies also demonstrated a plausible correlation between this ‘plasmablast signature’ and its capacity to predict antibody titers (Obermoser et al. 2013; Furman et al. 2013; Tsang et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Influenza is {{a global}} disease causing several million infections in humans every year. One of the most {{effective}} methods in controlling seasonal influenza epidemics is prophylactic vaccination, which requires fast, effective and reliable processes to produce large amounts of vaccine doses every year.

However, several limitations are associated with this method including low efficiency, limited scalability and potential allergic reactions induced by egg proteins. Hence, mammalian cell culture based vaccine production has been developed requiring new downstream process strategies for virus purification. The presented study focused on the development of a pseudo-affinity capture step for Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture derived influenza viruses by sulphated cellulose membranes. Extensive purification studies were done using different influenza virus strains including two strains from the season 2007 / 2008 (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (subtype H 3 N 2), B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) and A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (subtype H 1 N 1). Viral recoveries based on hemagglutination activity (HA), as well as reduction of host cell dsDNA and total protein were directly compared to results obtained with commercially available cation exchange membrane adsorbers and cellufineTM sulphate. With the modified cellulose membranes a higher viral product recovery was achieved than with cellufineTM sulphate and the cation exchange membrane adsorbers, respectively. Due to the low back pressure and fast binding kinetics allowing significantly higher flow rates, sulfated cellulose membranes are economically favorable over column based media such as cellufineTM sulphate. Therefore, sulphated cellulose membranes seem to be an attractive tool for industrial downstream processing of influenza virus in vaccine production. They might even have the potential to replace column based matrix cellufineTM sulphate, which is commonly used for virus purification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pigs {{have been}} implicated as mixing {{reservoir}} for {{the generation of}} new pandemic influenza strains, control of swine influenza has both veterinary and public health significance. Unlike <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> strains used for commercially available swine influenza vaccines are not regularly replaced, making the vaccines provide limited protection against antigenically diverse viruses. It is therefore necessary to develop broadly protective swine influenza vaccines that are efficacious to both homologous and heterologous virus infections. In this study, two forms of DNA vaccines were constructed, one was made by fusing M 2 e to consensus H 3 HA (MHa), which represents {{the majority of the}} HA sequences of H 3 N 2 swine influenza viruses. Another was made by fusing M 2 e and a conserved CTL epitope (NP 147 - 155) to consensus H 3 HA (MNHa). Their protective efficacies against homologous and heterologous challenges were tested. Results BALB/c mice were immunized twice by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) with the two DNA vaccines. It was shown that the two vaccines elicited substantial antibody responses, and MNHa induced more significant T cell-mediated immune response than MHa did. Then two H 3 N 2 strains representative of different evolutional and antigenic clusters were used to challenge the vaccine-immunized mice (homosubtypic challenge). Results indicated that both of the DNA vaccines prevented homosubtypic virus infections completely. The vaccines’ heterologous protective efficacies were further tested by challenging with a H 1 N 1 swine influenza virus and a reassortant 2009 pandemic strain. It was found that MNHa reduced the lung viral titers significantly in both challenge groups, histopathological observation showed obvious reduction of lung pathogenesis as compared to MHa and control groups. Conclusions The combined utility of the consensus HA and the conserved M 2 e and CTL epitope can confer complete and partial protection against homologous and heterologous challenges, respectively, in mouse model.

After pooling of the supernatants cell debris was removed by a combination of depth and membrane filters with an intermediate inactivation step using β-propiolactone. The virus was then concentrated 20 -fold by cross-flow ultrafiltration resulting in a first reduction of impurities. Levels of host cell protein and genomic DNA were further depleted by two subsequent chromatography steps: size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography. Yields of the depth and membrane filtration were consistently high with average values of 85 % and 93 %, respectively. In contrast, the yield of the concentration step was very sensitive to the filtration flux. A high flux led to membrane fouling and partial loss of the product. Limiting the flux to 28 l m- 2 h- 1, however, resulted in an average yield of 97 %. The average yield of the size-exclusion chromatography was 85 %. In order to maximize productivity, the injection volume and the fractionation were optimized in a modeling study. Anion-exchange chromatography was run in negative mode (virus in flowthrough). The optimal ionic strength to separate virus from DNA was determined in microtiter plate experiments. The product yield depended on the amount of virus loaded. Satisfactory yields of 82 % were obtained for viral loads > 160 kHAU per ml of resin. An overall yield of 53 % based on hemagglutination activity could be achieved. The amount of total protein (including the virus) and host cell DNA could be reduced to 3. 5 % and 0. 19 %, respectively. The protein purity of the final product was at least 94 %.

However, strong efforts {{are put into}} the development of cell culture-based vaccine production systems to overcome limitations and drawbacks of this production system. In cell culture-based vaccine production cellular physiology during infection is of great importance for process characterization and subsequent optimization approaches. The use of flow cytometry offers a powerful tool to monitor and correlate several physiological parameters on a single-cell level. Here, we present flow cytometric data on the replication of human influenza A virus in adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in lab-scale stirred-tank bioreactors. Physiological parameters of interest are apoptosis, status of infection and viral nucleoprotein content per cell. For the quantification of cellular infection status and content of viral nucleoprotein in the host-cells we established a sensitive immunocytometric detection method. In contrast to virus titration methods, this single cell-based immunocytometry is independent of dilution series {{and the number of}} infected cells. This is of interest especially in case of vaccine production processes, which are typically initiated at low multiplicities of infection. Apoptotic cell death occurring during virus propagation was measured via DNA strand breaks and pancaspase activity. Results obtained from monitoring vaccine production processes confirm a close correlation of apoptosis and influenza virus infection. Separate analysis of adherent and detached cell populations showed strong differences regarding status of infection and degree of apoptosis. The extend of apoptosis induction was found to be strongly dependent on culture conditions during the virus propagation phase. Based on these results, options to influence cell physiology to increase overall virus yields are being investigated. Together with mathematical models using population balances a better understanding of infection dynamics and host-cell interaction should be obtained to support a quantitative prediction of process behaviour and systematic process optimization [1].

Thus the epitope reactivity of the escape mutants was represented as A(+) B(-) D(-), A(-) B(+) D(-) and A(-) B(-) D(+). The HI antibody response of all antisera was biased to the site B epitope. In 9 / 12 antisera, obtained from seven rabbits immunized with whole virions, the site B epitope was predominant, representing 65 - 82 % of the total HI antibody. The restriction of HI antibody was unaffected by strain of rabbit, route of inoculation (intravenous or subcutaneous), use of Freund's adjuvant, and up to four immunizing injections. In 3 / 7 rabbits immunized with whole virus, there was a HI antibody response to the HC 2 (site A) or HC 10 (site D) epitope, but not both, of equal magnitude to the site B epitope. The HI antibody response {{in one of the}} rabbits (# 40) became more biased to the site B epitope between the third and fourth immunizing doses. Two further rabbits were immunized with virions which had been partially digested with bromelain and then purified from free HA. Both of these made equal HI antibody responses to the site B epitope and the site D epitope, possibly because their remaining HA spikes were better exposed. Overall, these data demonstrate an unexpected degree of restriction in the production of biologically relevant antibody, such that some rabbits (e. g. # 45) mount an HI antibody response which is essentially epitope-specific. Implications for epitope specificity of HI antibody stimulated by <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and also for the generation of antigenic drift variants are discussed. The reason for the non-responsiveness of the immune system to the many other HI epitopes of the HA is not known...|$|E
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are {{traditionally}} produced in embryonated chicken eggs. However, due to several disadvantages of this method, mammalian cell culture based influenza vaccine production processes {{are currently being}} established demanding new virus purification methods. Our study provides comprehensive results from three different strategies to capture Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture-derived influenza virus particles (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005, A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34, B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004) based on affinity and pseudo-affinity adsorption. First, an affinity based capture step, lectin-affinity chromatography (LAC), was developed. This method was investigated concerning the selection of lectins and matrices, viral recoveries and contaminant depletion as well as process robustness. LAC showed {{a high degree of}} contaminant reduction, in particular host cell dsDNA depletion. The results from LAC represent a high potential of an affinity capture step {{at the beginning of a}} downstream process for production of viral vaccines. Influenza viruses have an affinity to sulfated carbohydrates, such as heparin or sulfated cellulose. Hence, column based Cellufine® sulfate is often used in industrial influenza virus purification. The main disadvantage of this method is the limited flow rate, due to high back pressure, leading to suboptimal process productivity. To overcome this drawback, we have developed a second capturing method for influenza viruses based on sulfated reinforced cellulose membranes (SCM). Compared to commercially available cation exchange membrane adsorbers and column based Cellufine® sulfate resin, these membrane adsorbers achieved high product recoveries and contaminant reduction. In addition, the SCM allow an increased flow rate during capturing leading to superior productivity compared to conventional bead chromatography. Hence, this method is an economic alternative for industrial influenza vaccine production. The third purification strategy was capturing of influenza viruses by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using zinc modified membrane adsorbers. This method shows valuable purification results for the influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34. However, IMAC depends highly on the primary structure of viral envelope proteins as well as the accessibility of certain amino acids. Hence, IMAC is an interesting capturing method of A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 in a laboratory scale, but is only of limited interest for industrial vaccine production processes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mandatory {{influenza}} vaccination {{of health care}} workers (HCWs) has generated significant controversy {{over the last several}} years. Many health care organizations have implemented mandatory policies in order to boost vaccination rates of health care workers due to failed attempts at voluntary strategies. The trivalent <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been proven to be a relatively safe and cost effective tool in mitigating influenza. However, it has also demonstrated a varied efficacy rate from season to season and person to person. There have been previous studies evaluating {{influenza vaccination}} for HCWs who work with the elderly, but little data is available on tertiary care hospitals. The object of this review is to determine if there is sufficient data behind the effectiveness of influenza vaccination of HCWs in preventing nosocomial infections in tertiary care hospitals to justify a mandate with negative associated consequences such as termination, relocation, or mask wearing for a non-compliant HCW. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, Medline-PubMed, NIH clinical trials website, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website, using the keywords: health personnel, cross infection, nosocomial, <b>influenza</b> <b>human,</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine,</b> and tertiary care hospital. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Two studies met the inclusion criteria and were featured in this systematic review. A prospective observational study demonstrated an inverse association between HCW vaccination rates and nosocomial influenza rates among patients. A nested case-control investigation indicated a protective effect on hospital-acquired influenza (HAI) when more than 35 % of healthcare workers were vaccinated. Conclusion: The two studies included in this review demonstrate a protective effect in preventing nosocomial infections in tertiary care hospitals. However, these studies have multiple limitations and biases. Based on these studies, the data is inconclusive and does not support a strong recommendation for mandatory influenza vaccination of HCWs for prevention of nosocomial infections in tertiary care hospitals.

40|$|Influenza {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{worldwide}} spread diseases. Besides antiviral medical treatments, prophylactic vaccinations are crucial to control seasonal influenza epidemics. Hence, every year large amounts of vaccine doses have to be produced. Conventionally, embryonated chicken eggs are used for <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production. This production process has only a limited scalability. In addition, these vaccines contain egg derived proteins which may cause allergic reactions. Hence, cell culture based vaccine production processes have been developed, which require an adapted downstream processing strategy. One unit operation, which is often used in influenza virus purification, is column chromatography based on cellufine® sulphate. The main disadvantage of this method for this application is the limited flow rate due to the high back pressure, leading to a suboptimal productivity rate of the process. The present study describes a capturing method for cell culture derived influenza viruses based on sulphated reinforced cellulose membranes. Purification studies have been done using different MDCK cell derived influenza virus strains: A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (H 3 N 2), A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) and B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004. Purification efficiency concerning viral yield as well as total protein and host cell dsDNA reduction using sulphated membranes was directly compared to commercially available cation exchange adsorbers and to column based cellufine® sulphate resin. The modified membranes achieved high product recoveries and contaminant reduction. Due to a fast binding kinetic and a low back pressure, membrane adsorbers enable to operate the capturing process at an increased flow rate. Hence, the productivity can be significantly enhanced making them to a valuable choice for industrial <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production processes. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers [accessed January 8, 2009...|$|R

40|$|Oral Abstract Session: Virology & Pathogenesis: Abstract #O- 109 Background: Influenza vaccine {{has been}} {{available}} for over 70 years, yet influenza still causes epidemics or pandemic with substantial morbidity and mortality. The protective responses induced by current <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> still primarily depend on vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the HA head. However, the continually evolving influenza virus evades herd immunity induced through natural infection and vaccination by means of antigenic drift and shift. These antigenic drift and shift events render vaccine stockpiling unviable {{in case of an}} outbreak or pandemic. In addition, a major shortcoming of current influenza vaccines is its long production time because of existing egg-based or cell-based vaccine manufactory pipelines. Thus, these factors combined necessitate the development of novel influenza vaccine with increased breadth of protection and potential for rapid production and deployment. Method: Recent studies indicated the conserved stem domain contains a greater proportion of vulnerable sites targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, anti-stem broadly neutralizing antibodies are detectable in some individuals at a low level, suggesting they can be induced naturally by infection and optimized by vaccination. Here, we reported the design of a bacterially expressed polypeptide that mimics a H 5 HA stem (i. e. group 1 HA) in the pre-fusion conformation by protein minimization. Results: The absent of HA head domain of this protein could focus host’s antibody responses toward the HA stem. The HA mini-stem folded as a trimer and it was resistant to thermal/chemical stress. It bound to various broadly neutralizing HA stem-specific antibodies with high affinity. Mice vaccinated with the group 1 HA mini-stems were protected from morbidity and mortality against lethal challenge by group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses, the first report of cross-group protection. Vaccine-induced antibodies showed broad HA reactivity and no antibody-dependent enhancement activity. Protection from lethal infection was attributed to a broadly reactive antibody response that was able to provide passive protection. Conclusion: The HA mini-stem vaccination can elicit cross-reactive antibody responses that confer robust protection against lethal heterologous influenza A virus challenge from both group 1 and 2 viruses. The recombinant protein is highly stable at room temperature and it can be readily produced in large scale. Our study provides a promising foundation for developing a HA stem-based ‘universal’ influenza vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Influenza {{remains a}} major public health concern. Every year several million people are getting infected. Strategies to control {{influenza}} outbreaks are mainly focused on prophylactic vaccinations in conjunction with antiviral medications. Hence, every year large amounts of vaccines have to be produced. In the case of pandemic outbreaks these production processes have to be shifted to the appropriate pandemic influenza strain, reducing the production capacity of seasonal vaccines. <b>Human</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are traditionally produced in embryonated chicken eggs. This method has only a reduced possibility to be scaled up. Furthermore it potentially causes allergic reactions induced by egg proteins. Hence cell culture based vaccine production has been developed requiring new downstream processing strategies for virus purification. Studies have shown that Euonymus europaeus lectin (EEL) is a suitable ligand for an affinity capture step to purify different human influenza virus strains derived from Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures [1] including two topical virus strains (A/Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005 (subtype H 3 N 2), B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004 : both from 33016 MDCK PF, Novartis Behring, Marburg, Germany; A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (subtype H 1 N 1)). The lectin EEL was immobilized on polymer beads and binds to terminal alpha-galactose of glycosylated viral envelope proteins such as the hemagglutinin. Characterization of the capturing potential demonstrated very good host cell DNA and protein reduction, {{while the majority of}} the virus (around 90 %) could be recovered as product. The method indicated excellent reproducibility between various tested influenza virus strains as well as different cultivation batches. In addition, the impact of the host cells on purification by EEL-affinity chromatography has been evaluated. Therefore, Influenza A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 virus was propagated in MDCK and Vero cells and screened for ligand binding. In a second part of the study different supports have been screened for EEL as ligand. This screening included stabilized reinforced cellulose membranes, polymer and porous glass particles, cellulose and agarose beads. Comparing virus binding abilities and product recoveries some of the tested materials indicated advantages for virus purification. The performance seems to be even superior to cellufine sulfate and heparin, two alternative affinity matrices currently used for influenza virus purification. Most virus binding was achieved by the cellulose membranes and the polymer based adsorbent. In addition, reinforced cellulose membranes have a far higher binding capacity than other tested adsorbents. With the tested virus strains our studies have shown that EEL-affinity chromatography is a valuable alternative to capture MDCK cell derived influenza viruses. Capturing studies will be completed using a reverse genetics derived reassortant H 5 N 1 virus. In addition, kinetic measurements are being currently performed to characterize the virus ligand binding in more detail by surface plasmon resonance technology. [1] Opitz,L. et al. 2007.

This heterosubtypic protection is neither detected, nor accurately predicted by in vitro immunogenicity assays.
