40|$|Under {{real option}} theory, {{property}} developers {{are able to}} determine the optimal timing of executing their investment projects on a risk-neutral basis. The writers adopted the Samuelson-McKean model to value the embedded option of the largest urban redevelopment project in Hong Kong-Kwun Tong Town Center-for its feasibility study. Then housing prices were simulated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. This paper has made {{a contribution to the}} real estate investment literature in tracing the plausible optima and adverse outcomes, particularly in situations in which perfect information is not available. The estimated mean value of the project is approximately $ 31. 14 billion, which is around 15 % lower than the required value, i. e., the <b>hurdle</b> <b>value</b> of $ 36. 65 billion. The finding has revealed that immediate implementation of the Kwun Tong redevelopment project is unfavorable from a financial standpoint because the expected return is insufficient to offset the cost of uncertainties.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the viability of rehabilitation from a financial standpoint and examine particularly whether a rehabilitation project is worth carrying out or not. Nowadays, rehabilitation has become all the more important in society. Theoretical option models may explain how to make an optimal decision, but in reality they seem to lack empirical evidence when it comes to some situation. This paper aims to use option models to gauge the likely gain/loss from rehabilitation in face of uncertainties. It seeks to bridge the gap in the rehabilitation field between theory and application for facilities managers and property owners alike. Design/methodology/approach: The binomial option model and Samuelson-McKean closed form model are utilised to evaluate the likely financial benefits of the two major rehabilitation schemes, exploring option premiums and hurdle values. The real option approaches provide a useful framework within which to gauge a likely gain (loss) and ascertain the viability of rehabilitation in the midst of uncertainties. Findings: The real option approaches produce two outcomes values, the option premium and the <b>hurdle</b> <b>value,</b> which are able to provide insight into the likelihood of rehabilitation for facilities managers/property owners in the intricate and dynamic markets. The higher the option premium, the more attractive a rehabilitation project will be. And the <b>hurdle</b> <b>value</b> usefully reveals a critical timing for exercising rehabilitation. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides a necessary support for sustaining the rehabilitation schemes. It presents an adequate alternative to examine the value of rehabilitation by taking into account uncertainties in real life. It is useful for facilities managers and property owners, who sometimes neglect potential benefit/loss in the uncertainties when making an investment decision. Practical implications: This paper has established the framework for evaluating the rehabilitation schemes that has practical implications for decision making. The facilities manager, property owner and government should make some adjustments in formulation of their rehabilitation policies and strategies. Originality/value: This paper provides facilities managers with a means in which the real option approaches are embedded to express benefit/costs of rehabilitation. With the aid of this information, facilities managers/property owners are able to evaluate rehabilitation more effectively and enhance the decision-making quality.

UNCERTAINTY AND THE RATE OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT This paper examines the relationship between uncertainty and investment in the context of the real options model. Specifically, we analyze the role of built property value volatility in determining the rate of commercial real estate construction. To focus on the uncertainty/investment relationship, we extend the standard model to determine the probability of investment over a particular time horizon. In doing so we find that an increase in asset volatility can either increase or decrease the probability of development, although the anticipated negative relationship is confirmed when the land is "ripe " for development (i. e., near the development <b>hurdle</b> <b>value).</b> The role of uncertainty in determining the rate of real investment is then tested using aggregate data. By developing two measures of property value volatility [...] an implied volatility estimate using commercial mortgage spreads and the volatility of quarterly REIT returns [...] we empirically confirm the expected strong relationship between uncertainty and development activity. We also find a relatively high degree of inertia in property value volatility, which suggests that uncertainty measures may be useful in predicting construction activity.

40|$|Measuring value {{creation}} {{by comparing the}} RAROC of an exposure (the return on risk capital) with a single institution-wide hurdle rate is inconsistent with the standard theory of financial valuation. We use asset pricing theory to determine the appropriate hurdle rate for such a RAROC performance measure. We find that this hurdle rate varies with the skewness of asset returns. Thus the RAROC hurdle rate should differ substantially between equity which has a right skew and debt which has a pronounced left skew and also between different qualities of debt exposure. We discuss implications for financial institution risk management and supervision. asset pricing; banking; capital allocation; capital budgeting; capital management; corporate finance; downside risk; economic capital; performance measurement; RAROC; risk management; <b>value</b> creation; <b>hurdle</b> rate; <b>value</b> at risk...|$|R
40|$|How do informational asymmetries between bidders {{affect the}} outcome of common value auctions? Should the seller accept bids from bidders with more precise information? If so, under what conditions? What effect do such asymmetries have on the seller’s {{expected}} revenue? We analyze these questions in a simple model in which an insider competes with an outsider. Both have some information {{about the value of}} the asset for sale, but the insider’s information is more precise. We derive the optimal mechanism and show that it must be biased against the insider. With an optimal mechanism, the seller’s expected revenue is higher if the bidders are more asymmetrically informed. We show how the optimal mechanism can be implemented as a second-price sealed bid auction that lets the insider win only if his bid is above a <b>hurdle</b> priceAuctions, Common <b>Value</b> Auctions, Asymmetric Bidders, Winner’s Curse...|$|R
40|$|The {{elimination}} of 2 ̆ 2 waste, fraud, and abuse 2 ̆ 2 from American medicine {{is not a}} quick or easy solution {{to the challenge of}} rising medical care costs. Although there are clearly some savings available, particularly in the area of administration, they likely amount to far less than many policymakers hope. Many of the policy options available for reducing excesses face significant political <b>hurdles</b> or involve <b>value</b> judgments about non-quantifiable issues involving quality of care. Other alternatives seem as likely to bar necessary medical care as to eliminate abuses. In some instances, particularly those involving consumer fraud, a crackdown may merely shift costs without saving any money. Finally, a number of the suggestions for trimming waste and abuse involve ethical and moral judgments that Americans have yet to acknowledge and, in any event, may not wish to sign over to the government or any other third party...|$|R

40|$|With the use {{of smart}} mobile devices, {{learning}} opportunities have been greatly increased in education. Especially, digital textbooks are the new primary digital instructional resource for elementary and middle schools. The use of electronic textbooks in a mobile learning environment assists collaborative learning and increases access to educational resources. Learners {{are now able to}} share their bookmarks, notes and highlights both on and off campus. These annotation features can lead to enhanced learning effect for students. Digital textbooks still face several <b>hurdles</b> as the <b>value</b> of using electronic textbooks for students remains unclear. Major reasons limiting the uptake of digital textbooks include usability and design issues. One of the most important features in education is interaction between resources and students such as annotating or highlighting. To enhance value of digital textbooks, we designed a prototype note-taking interface reflecting students learning pattern and selfdirected learning. The interface and functionality were defined in order to support touchbased annotation input and cooperative learning.

40|$|Abstract — With the {{increased}} competition in every business sector the term Co-Creation {{can play an}} important role for higher growth in business through customers. This research suggests platforms and implementation direction for using this tool in much better way. The research is conceptual in nature, which focuses on methodological engaging consumers. In previous researches co-creation is largely appreciated but systematic, practical approach and applicability have not been much focused. Research contributes a co-creation model which can be realistic to engage consumers effectively and efficiently. It also sheds light on the behavioural aspects of customers’ perception towards Co-Creation. The paper proposes constructs to providers for identifying the tendency to co-create and the level of customer’s participation. It can be helpful in designing policies and procedures to gain higher satisfaction, trust and loyalty from customer and develops it as strategic competitive advantage as well as help in enhancing Innovative ideas through customers. This research gives viewpoint on identifying and evaluating the <b>hurdles</b> in co-creating <b>value.</b> It proposes various perspectives for Co-Creation implementation and {{to use it as a}} Marketing Strategy and to develop competitive advantag...|$|R
40|$|Hopwood (2007) which {{questioned}} {{the direction and}} value added of non-AIS accounting research, we discuss the state of research in Accounting Information Systems. AIS researchers face a significant <b>hurdle</b> in undertaking <b>value</b> added research given that the financial and human resources that industry devotes to {{research and development of}} AIS technology dwarfs the capabilities of academic researchers. In these circumstances, we put forward a paradigm for AIS research based on the principle of comparative advantage, which is the powerful economic force that ensures that trade can take place even between parties where one has an absolute superiority over the other. It is our contention that if AIS academics are to succeed in creating value added research then they have to identify what they can do that the AIS industry, despite all its financial and human resource advantages, cannot or will not do. And what economic theory indicates is that such opportunities to add value always exist—if only academics are willing to seek them out. We illustrate our paradigm by analyzing three potential sources of comparative advantage for AIS researchers and discussing illustrative examples of research in each of these areas...|$|R
40|$|A Tragedy of the Commons (ToC) models many {{systems of}} human {{exploitation}} of natural resources. In a plant-systems application of ToC, multiple plants compete over shared nutrients and space. Tragically these resources become exhausted {{due to their}} open-access to multiple plants. Our study focuses on determining whether two competing plants pay a reproductive cost due to ToC. We predict that plants create a ToC and subsequently pay a reproductive cost. We quantify a ToC by measuring a plant’s reproductive mass {{as well as its}} total root mass. Typically, ToC lowers reproductive mass and raises total root mass. Our study uses barriers to manipulate interplant competition. One group is grown 1 cm apart to promote root competition and another group is split by impermeable barriers to prevent competition. We specifically used ultra-clear growth medium (Gellan Gum with Hoagland’s solution) in order to photograph roots as they grow in vivo. Root imaging allows for computational analysis of root architecture which we expect to respond to a ToC. Preliminary results of plant masses show no significant effects from competition. This is thought to be due to high soil nutrient <b>values.</b> <b>Hurdles</b> include proving validity of the photographic analysis. The projects future involves optimizing nutrient level and validating photographic analysis via multiple circumferential pictures...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Payments to farmers under federal farm programs have reached an historic high [...] over $ 20 billion in fiscal year 2000. Nearly half of U. S. farms are receiving payments for income or price support purposes and/or for engaging in activities such as land conservation. These payments, in total, made up almost one-half of net farm income in fiscal year 2000. Despite the annual influx of billions of federal dollars to the farm sector, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports {{that the number of}} farms has been declining about one percent per year, with the most notable declines in small family farms and young farmers. GAO reviewed USDA's annual surveys of U. S. farm operations [...] called the Agricultural Resource Management Study [...] and state and crop information from its Program Payments Reporting System to (1) determine the distribution of farm payments over the past decade by farm size, operators' age, state, and crop and (2) identify the major barriers that make it difficult for young people to enter farming. GAO found that in recent years, over 80 percent of farm payments have been made to large- and medium-sized farms, while small farms have received less than 20 percent of the payments. Even though small farms substantially outnumber medium and large farms, because payments are generally based on volume of production, the average payment to small farms was much less than the average payment to medium and large farms. The distribution pattern for 1999 was {{similar to that of the}} other years during the past decade, but the portion of the payments going to large farms has increased and the portion going to small farms has decreased since 1996. Farmers under age 35 received about 6 percent of farm payments while farmers ages 35 through 54 received 56 percent of the payments. Farm payments are principally directed at producers of eight major crops: wheat, corn, barley, oats, sorghum, rice, cotton, and oilseeds,. All states received a portion of payments, but six states [...] Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota [...] together received almost half of the payments in 1999. The major obstacle facing young people who wish to enter farming is the high cost of acquiring the needed assets, principally farmland and farm machinery. Although farm program payments can help beginning farmers once they have started farming, the payments can also present a <b>hurdle</b> because their <b>value</b> is reflected in a higher price to buy or lease the farmland. ...|$|R
