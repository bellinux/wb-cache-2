2500|$|Interpreting God's {{words in}} [...] "I will destroy {{them with the}} earth," [...] Rav Huna and Rabbi Jeremiah in Rav Kahana's name taught that the Flood washed away even the three handbreadths of the Earth's surface that a plough turns. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> prince had a tutor, and {{whenever}} the prince did wrong, the king punished the tutor. Or <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> young prince had a nurse, and whenever the prince did wrong, the king punished the nurse. Similarly, God said that God would destroy the generation of the Flood along with the earth that nurtured them.|$|E

[...] After Chen Yuanguang heard the news, he led a troop of light cavalry to defend against the rebels. [...] He fought the whole day long, but was killed by the sword of the enemy general, whose name was Lan Fenggao (...) [...] [...] The people of Zhangzhou were devastated. [...] To them, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> parent had died. [...] Chen Yuanguang was buried at Daqiyuan. [...] Later on, his remains were moved to Zhangzhou.|$|E
2500|$|Howie Morenz {{was one of}} the NHL's superstars of the 1930s. However, his career, and {{eventually}} life, ended in a game between his Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks on January 28, 1937, at the Montreal Forum. In that game, Morenz was checked by Chicago player Earl Seibert into the boards in what seemed like a normal hit. However, as the boards were made of wood at the time, Morenz's leg shattered in five separate locations above the ankle. He was carried off the ice on a stretcher to a hospital, where he would stay for four and a half weeks until his death from a heart attack. At one time, one visitor noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> party was being held inside of Morenz's hospital room, complete with whiskey and beer. Morenz died on March 8 the same year, from, as teammate Aurele Joliat put it, [...] "a broken heart" [...] (Morenz suffered a heart attack the night before). Morenz's #7 sweater, which had been hanging in its usual stall while he was in hospital, was finally retired for good.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Judah contrasted God's {{words to}} Abraham, [...] "walk before Me," [...] in [...] with the words, [...] "Noah walked with God," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah {{compared}} it to a king who had two sons, one grown up {{and the other a}} child. The king asked the child to walk with him. But the king asked the adult to walk before him. Similarly, to Abraham, whose moral strength was great, God said, [...] "Walk before Me." [...] But of Noah, who was feeble, [...] says, [...] "Noah walked with God." [...] Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a king's friend who was plunging about in dark alleys, and when the king saw him sinking in the mud, the king urged his friend to walk with him instead of plunging about. Abraham's case, however, was compared to that of a king who was sinking in dark alleys, and when his friend saw him, the friend shined a light for him through the window. The king then asked his friend to come and shine a light before the king on his way. Thus, God told Abraham that instead of showing a light for God from Mesopotamia, he should come and show one before God in the Land of Israel. Similarly, [...] says, [...] "And he blessed Joseph, and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk .... Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Johanan's name and Resh Lakish gave two illustrations of this. Rabbi Johanan said: <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> shepherd stood and watched his flocks. (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God and under Gods protection.) Resh Lakish said: <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> prince walked along while the elders preceded him (as an escort, to make known his coming). (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God, spreading word of God.) The Midrash taught that in Rabbi Johanan's view: We need God's proximity, while in Resh Lakish's view, God needs us to glorify God (by propagating the knowledge of God's greatness). Similarly, a Midrash read the words [...] "Noah walked with God" [...] in [...] to mean that God supported Noah, so that Noah should not be overwhelmed by the evil behavior of the generation of the Flood. The Midrash compared this to a king whose son went on a mission for his father. The road ahead of him was sunken in mire, and the king supported him so that he would not sink in the mire. However, in the case of Abraham, God said in [...] "walk before Me," [...] and regarding the Patriarchs, Jacob said in [...] "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked." [...] For the Patriarchs would try to anticipate the Divine Presence, and would go ahead to do God's will.|$|E
