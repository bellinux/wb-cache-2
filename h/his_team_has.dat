Occasionally a longer penalty may be assessed for more severe infractions. Players penalised for 6 personal fouls must leave the game.

[...] During a typical game, each team will have three to five extra man offence opportunities.|$|E
500|$|According to Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon, [...] "since the beginning, one of {{the things}} that's {{separated}} us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak." [...] When asked if Capcom's Street Fighter series would ever do a crossover game with Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono called Mortal Kombat a very different game from Street Fighter. Capcom's senior director of communications compared Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat by asking if the interviewer preferred the [...] "precision and depth" [...] of Street Fighter or the [...] "gore and comedy" [...] of Mortal Kombat; he also stated that the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat rivalry was considered similar to the Coke and Pepsi rivalry in the 1990s. Senior producer of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Hans Lo, himself also called Street Fighter [...] "a little more cartoonic fantasy" [...] in comparison to Mortal Kombat. In 2013, Boon named the hypothetical [...] "MKvsSF" [...] as his dream crossover game. In 2014, Boon said <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>has</b> remained in touch with Capcom, but no one could resolve the incompatibility problem of Mortal Kombat being much more brutal than Street Fighter.|$|E

[...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor.
