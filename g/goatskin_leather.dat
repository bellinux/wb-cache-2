50|$|Other key {{features}} include horsehide or <b>goatskin</b> <b>leather</b> for the shell, dual-knit waist and wrist cuffs, full-length brass zipper, two brass grommets under each armpit for ventilation, a metal hook under the collar to fasten {{the top of}} the opening, and snap-down collar so the tips won't blow around from propwash and jetwash. Seams on the arms of the jacket run along the backside of the pattern, so as not to interfere with movement of the arms along the sides of the torso in confined spaces. Military specifications did not provide for insulation of the A-2 model.|$|E
5000|$|In 1899 Thomas Sturge Moore was {{introduced}} to her family and she developed a close life-long friendship. After Moore introduced her to Charles Ricketts, the artist and book designer, she grew an interest in bookbinding. [...] She taught herself, learning from Douglas Cockerell's classic, Bookbinding and the Care of Books, but also used Moore and Ricketts as advisors and critics throughout her career. By 1906 she had produced her first binding after establishing a workshop in her father's house at Priest Hill in Limpsfield, Surrey. Early bindings were in white or natural pigskin but she increasingly used colored <b>goatskin</b> <b>leather</b> inlays and by 1934 bound a book with 6 different colored inlays.|$|E
50|$|Goatskin {{refers to}} {{the skin of a}} goat, which by long term usage, is denoted by the term Morocco leather. Kidskin, used for gloves, shoes and other accessories, is {{traditionally}} <b>goatskin,</b> although other <b>leathers</b> such as sheep and kangaroo {{can be used to make}} kid.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} is to determine mutual converted value between unfinished leather to finished leather as commercial commodity. The raw materials are wet chrome tanned goatskins which are converted into jacket leather and chrome tanned <b>goatskins</b> into glace <b>leather.</b> Weight, wide, thickness is measured during this process, and the last is carried out in accordance with Indonesia Industrial Standard, for each step of the process. The sample taken in accordance with ISO. 2588 1973 is n = 0, 5 √N, where N is the number of cattle slaughtered. The sheeps taken were 148 sheets (197 sheets available) and the goats taken were 130 sheets (195 sheets available). The conclusion {{of this research}} are the conversion value of some sheepskins and goatskins from chrome tanned, sheepskins into glace and goatskins into jacket. ...|$|R
50|$|Folio {{publications}} {{are printed}} {{in a range}} of standard sizes (in 1951, for example, these included Royal Octavo, Medium Octavo, Crown Octavo and Demy Octavo), and custom sizes are also employed. The most common material for bindings is buckram or a similar bookcloth, but there are many exceptions: aluminium foil was used in binding Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in 1971, and vegetable parchment in binding Voltaire's The Calas Affair in 1994; more commonly, marbled papers (often produced by Ann Muir Marbling Ltd.) have been used for several volumes in recent years, either as endpapers or as board-papers of quarter bindings; moiré silk (usually artificial) has been used sporadically over the years as a binding material, and <b>leather</b> (vellum and <b>goatskin)</b> and bonded <b>leather</b> are sometimes used, chiefly for the more expensive editions. Most bindings for works of fiction are designed by the illustrator. Non-fiction binding designers include David Eccles, Jeff Clements, and Neil Gower.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} or artisanal {{method of}} making kefir {{is to add}} 2-10% kefir grains directly to milk in a sealed <b>goatskin</b> <b>leather</b> bag, which is traditionally agitated one or more times a day. Today the leather bag is replaced with a corrosion-resistant container such as a glass jar. It is not filled to capacity, allowing room for some expansion as the carbon dioxide gas produced causes the liquid level to rise. Non-lightproof containers are stored in the dark to prevent degradation of light-sensitive vitamins. After a period of fermentation lasting around 24 hours, ideally at 20-25 °C (68-77 °F), the grains are strained from the liquid using a corrosion-resistant (stainless steel or plastic) utensil, and kept as the starter for another batch.|$|E

40|$|A 5 % aqueous {{solution}} of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (m. wt. 125, 000), nitrocellulose and PVA/nitrocellulose blend were applied as a topcoat on dyed <b>goatskin</b> <b>leather.</b> The FT-IR spectroscopy {{of the cast}} polymer films indicated {{that each of the}} films in dry state consist of only pure polymer. The microscopic and physical characteristics of the coatings were also determined. The PVA coatings were found to have a glossy appearance, smooth handle and good extensibility, with excellent rubbing fastness and light fastness properties. However, the coatings have only a moderate adhesion of finish and have poor heat fastness and flexing endurance properties. The properties were found to improve when PVA was used in blend with nitrocellulose emulsion. The nitrocellulose coatings were, however, found to exhibit an almost all round superior coating property...|$|E
50|$|The best of Sandgren's {{bindings}} are in {{a simple}} and timeless design. On his famous full leather bindings, of which he made around 100, the decoration {{is limited to a}} gilt frame near the edges of the sides - e.g. a gilt line, pattern or geometric design - and the large central area of the sides are free from decoration, so the quality and colour of the leather is in focus. Sandgren only used the very best in <b>goatskin</b> or Morocco <b>leather</b> with a beautiful, natural structure, and his bindings are in subdued, darker colours, for example brown or red. His principle is not unlike the Danish furniture designers, like Hans Wegner, where the natural colors, textures and flexibility of the wood are highlighted in their furniture.August Sandgren only used a small number of stamps to decorate the spines of the bindings, but he used them with great variety. He used marbled sidepaper, handmade by himself, and they were kept in darker colors - brown, black, dark green and blue, and the most beautiful paper has vertical, dense stripes.|$|R

Binding: Pasteboards covered in dark brown <b>leather</b> (<b>goatskin)</b> with red <b>leather</b> (<b>goatskin)</b> repairs; Type II (with flap) though flap is now missing; may be original, given the contemporaneous dating of the similar cover on Chester Beaty Library Moritz Collection 60 (see Bosch, Carswell, & Petherbridge no. 77, p. 201); upper and lower cover bear a design blind-tooled with gold paint, consisting of of frame, central scalloped mandorla, and accents; frame has a central motif made with interlocking S-shaped stamps, two fillets on either side, and an innermost fifth fillet painted gold; corners of the frame are marked with diagonal lines of small crosses, {{similar to the ones}} on the titlepiece; at center is 10 -lobed mandorla, the scallops of which have a double gold painted outline, as well as small circles at the apex of each scallop and small crosses where the ends of each scallop meet; ogival points have simple, three-pointed calyxes atop slightly arched crossbars; interior of the mandorla bears another calyx with additional ogival calyxes, which are also painted gold on the upper cover; within the mandorla an elaborate filled pattern is present, but difficult to see; doublures are of a slightly lighter brown leather, have four-fillet frames and bear small, hand-tooled, sixteen-lobed shamsas with clearly visible centering lines that extend to the edges of the innermost fillet of the frames; in poor condition. Support: non-European laid paper, at least three types are used; one paper is rather thick with chainlines running horizontally in alternating groups of 2 and 3, individual chainlines spaced 11 mm. apart and groups spaced roughly 40 mm. apart; another paper seems quite similar except for having been tinted a brownish-ochre; third paper is of a similar color to the second, but smaller, thinner, more highly burnished, and rather ragged at the edges; the tinted papers appear to have been laid into the quires to embellish the copy. Decoration: Titlepiece on fol. 1 a consists of a rectangular panel bearing the title in red tawqīʻ above a central panel bearing a circular medallion (shamsah) with 'pendants' (Weisweiler class. 57 - 60) bordered in gold-painted black double-lines filled with a central pattern of small crosses and carrying an ex libris in red tawqīʻ; piece is framed with an outermost red fillet, a gold-filled double black line, a central series of equilateral crosses that seem to recall blind-tooling techniques, another gold-filled double black line, and final, innermost red fillet; text is polychrome with the main text in black {{and a variety of other}} colors used in various combinations for the headings and the dots separating the hemistitches, often with some sort of scheme of alternating colors; in the opening quires, both the chapter headings and the dots are in red, but in subsequent quires the dots may be red while the titles are in lime green;a slate-blue color also often appears; often the dots will be outlined in either black or yellowish-white ink; obviously executed with careful attention.

Support: non-European laid paper (Possibly post- 1350 14 th century Syro-Egyptian, see Loveday p. 83), somewhat thick and soft almost to the point of flocculence; laid and chain lines are very difficult to discern; laid lines run horizontally and are set closely together; chain lines are occasionally visible, in once case what appears to be a set of 3 chainlines 11 - 12 mm. apart and a set of 2 chainlines 14 - 15 mm. apart, with the two sets roughly 22 mm. apart; a European paper is used for the replaced leaves and for the added ternion at the beginning of the codex (carrying the table of contents) with vertical chain lines roughly 26 - 27 mm. apart and bearing a watermark of paschal lamb enclosed in a four-lobed circle, approx. 50 x 50 mm., similar but far from identical to Heawood 2840 (Verona, 1678), Piccard inv.

Decoration: Text rubricated with overlining referring to the glosses in red; an iron-gall ink, now significantly browned, was used until fol. 145 a (p. 289), where the scribe switched to a carbon-based ink which is still quite black; figure accompanying the text appears in the margin of fol. 125 b (p. 250). Script: Naskh; same Syro-Egyptian hand throughout (including the vast majority of the gloss and with the exception of the replaced leaves) with tapering, non-serifed alifs and a mix of open and closed counters (tending towards open); both the lām alif al-mukhaffafah and al-warrāqīyah are used and kāf mabsūṭah is sometimes used; fully pointed and occasionally vocallized.
