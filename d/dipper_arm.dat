50|$|Attached {{to the end}} of {{the boom}} is the stick (or <b>dipper</b> <b>arm).</b> The stick {{provides}} the digging force needed to pull the bucket through the ground. The stick length is optional depending whether reach (longer stick) or break-out power (shorter stick) is required.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "backhoe" [...] {{refers to}} {{the action of the}} shovel, not its {{location}} on the vehicle : a backhoe digs by drawing earth backwards, rather than lifting it with a forward motion like a man shovelling, a steam shovel or a bulldozer. Confusingly, the buckets on some backhoes may be reconfigured facing forward, making them [...] "hoes". However they are not as effective in that orientation, since the dimensions of the various components are optimized for back-hoeing. Most backhoes are at their strongest curling the bucket, with the <b>dipper</b> <b>arm</b> next most powerful, and boom movements the least powerful.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{recently}} more used {{method of}} improving weld quality at the weld {{transition to the}} plate called HFMI (High Frequency Mechanical Impact) has been investigated and tried on two demonstrators, a bogie beam in an articulated hauler and a <b>dipper</b> <b>arm</b> in an excavator, see fig. 1. The designs of the beams have been made so that thinner plates can be used and higher material strength can be utilized. Such an approach needs {{to make use of}} local based analysis methods and in this case the effective notch method was used. Recently made research has suggested SN-curves where the use of HFMI in combination with different material yield strengths are described and these FAT values have been used to develop allowed stress levels in the beams to fulfill the life requirements. All this resulted in components which were 24 % and 18 % lighter using plate thicknesses of 8 - 12 mm in material yield 700 MPa. They were then produced and tested in a rig to verify the designs. The results imply that the HFMI treatment is a very promising method to build lighter welded structures, however, the design needs to take some new considerations into account to succeed...|$|E

She came into the house, and Mary Erskine, raking open the ashes in the fire-place, took out two large coals with the tongs, and dropped them into the dipper. Mary Bell held the <b>dipper</b> at <b>arm's</b> length before her, and began to walk along.|$|R
50|$|The {{workgroup}} of {{a compact}} hydraulic excavator {{consists of the}} boom, <b>dipper</b> or <b>arm,</b> and attachment (e.g. auger, bucket or breaker). It {{is connected to the}} front of the excavator's house structure via a swing frame that allows the workgroup to be hydraulically pivoted left or right to achieve offset digging for trenching parallel with the tracks. Certain manufacturers including Terex and Caterpillar (CAT) offer an extendable boom option, much like the extendable boom of a backhoe loader.|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} note describes the conceiving and planning phase, the licence and EU funding procedure {{and the first}} results of a demanding habitat improvement program for Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix), {{carried out in the}} territories of ‘Telve - Telve di sopra - Carzano’ hunting communal Reserve, in eastern Trentino. Through the years 2006 - 2007, activities will affect a surface of about 25. 5 ha of underutilized pastures, by now invaded by shrubs and arboreal species regeneration, for a total amount of 64. 250 €, whose funding will be provided thanks to the 2000 - 2006 Rural Development Plan by the Autonomous Province of Trento. Plan’s 9. 2. 3 c) provision sets in fact “activities aimed at preserving and enhancing biodiversity of an area, including what wildlife regards [...] . ” within investments eligible for public contribution. Central Valsugana Forest Association - constituted in 2005 by Telve, Carzano and Telve di sopra and other villages - thus submitted the adherence application to the Plan for the year 2005, giving a program of the investments relevant to the 9. 2. 3 c) provision, for a total amount of 93. 300 €. Seven are the Reserve’s areas object of the established habitat improvement activities, which have already been carried out in 3 of these in the period July, 31 st - October 30 th 2006. Activities involved shrub mulching in shrub invaded areas: these were performed with an excavator Euromach 6500 equipped with a Seppi M. BMS-L head - and a rotor with swinging hammer - on its <b>dipper</b> <b>arm.</b> In the end, perspectives consistent with coordinating actions of habitat improvement activities and test of their actual effectiveness are described. Without doubt, in the last years the specific Rural Development Plan’s 9. 2. 3 c) provision has made it possible - also in other situations of the Provincial territory - to realize important habitat improvement activities devoted particularly to wildlife...|$|E
