50|$|Hot short iron is brittle when hot. This was {{a serious}} problem as most iron used during the 17th and 18th century was bar or wrought iron. Wrought iron is shaped by {{repeated}} blows with a hammer while hot. A piece of hot short iron will crack if worked with a hammer. When a piece of hot iron or steel cracks the exposed surface immediately oxidizes. This layer of oxide prevents the mending of the crack by welding. Large cracks cause the iron or steel to break up. Smaller cracks can cause the object to fail during use. The degree of <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> is {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of sulfur present. Today iron with over 0.03% sulfur is avoided.|$|E

The current study aims to determine a window of Si contents with a given Ni content needed to counteract {{the negative effects of}} Sn and Cu to reduce <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> and to determine the mechanism. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), SEM-EDS, XRD, and TEM were used to study the <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> behavior of Fe containing 0. 2 pct Cu, 0. 05 pct Ni, 0. 01 pct Sn and with varying Si-content (0. 02 pct, 0. 1 pct, 0. 15 pct, and 0. 2 pct Si). It was found that the fayalite formation resulting in a reduction of oxidation and consequently liquid Cu formation occurred for all Si contents examined. The range of Si contents between 0. 1 and 0. 2 wt pct Si exhibited a mechanism that was a combination of fayalite formation impeding oxidation as well as occlusion of the Cu-rich liquid. This range was acceptable to alleviate <b>hot</b> <b>shortness...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} the {{temperature}} on the growth of the shortness cracks and consequently on the mechanical properties of a 20 Mn 4 steel was studied. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out on thermo-mechanical simulator Gleeble 3800 TM in a range of temperatures between 1000 ° and 1280 °C. Heat treatments at different temperatures and holding times were carried out in a tubular furnace. After tensile test and heat treatments, the samples were characterised by SEM in order to evaluate the effect of microstructural evolution on the <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> behaviour.

40|$|Material {{formability}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} research topics in metal forming, but it is usually regarded as a secondary concern in processes carried out at high temperature. Though usually entailing higher material ductility, the high temperature used in hot forging can lead to the phenomenon of <b>hot</b> <b>shortness,</b> with fall of material formability due to the microstructural changes during the deformation. Hot metal formability modelling can imply three main issues: (i) the lack of models expressly developed for high temperatures, (ii) the exponential increase of the experimental effort which is needed for the model calibration, since different thermo-mechanical conditions need to be tested, according to the process window parameters, and consequently (iii) the more complex model calibration, especially if inverse analysis techniques are used. In this work the formability of the AA 6082 -T 6 aluminum alloy is investigated by means of tensile tests carried out at different temperatures and strain rates. The <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> onset is identified as well as the negative strain rate influence on the material maximum strain at fracture. A linear dependency of the material formability on the Zener-Hollomon parameter is established for temperatures below the <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> point, allowing a significant simplification of the experiments needed for the calibration. A new formability model is proposed to overcome the limits of the linear correlation thanks to the introduction of a critical value of the Zener-Hollomon parameter. The Oyane-Sato damage criterion is then extended to hot conditions using the afore mentioned Zener-Hollomon dependency. Finally, the approach is validated on the reference industrial case: the cross wedge rolling of AA 6082 -T 6 round bars carried out at elevated temperature showing axial cracking due to Mannesmann effect...|$|E
40|$|Residual Cu in {{recycled}} {{steel scrap}} can cause <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> when the iron matrix is oxidized. <b>Hot</b> <b>shortness</b> can occur directly after the solid steel is formed from continuous casting as the steel undergoes a cooling {{process known as}} secondary cooling where water is first sprayed on the surface to promote cooling. This {{is followed by a}} radiant cooling stage where the steel is cooled in air to room temperature. This investigation examines the roles of water vapor, Si content, temperature, and the presence of Sn in a Fe- 0. 2 wt pct Cu- 0. 05 wt pct Ni alloy on oxidation, separated Cu and Cu induced-hot shortness during simulations of the secondary cooling process. The secondary cooling from 1473 K (1200 °C) resulted in a slight increase in liquid quantity and grain boundary penetration as compared to the isothermal heating cycles at 1423 K (1150 °C) due to the higher temperatures experienced in the non-isothermal cycle. The addition of water vapor increased the sample oxidation as compared to samples processed in dry atmospheres due to increased scale adherence, scale plasticity, and inward transport of oxygen. The increase in weight gain of the wet atmosphere increased the liquid formation at the interface in the non-Si containing alloys. The secondary cooling cycle with water vapor and the effect of Sn lead to the formation of many small pools of Cu-rich liquid embedded within the surface of the metal due to the Sn allowing for increased grain boundary decohesion and the water vapor allowing for oxidation within liquid-penetrated grain boundaries. The presence of Si increased the amount of occlusion of Cu and Fe, significantly decreasing the quantity of liquid at the interface and the amount of grain boundary penetration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Copper {{and nickel}} are {{accumulated}} in steels when steel scrap {{is used as}} steel sources. It {{is well known that}} copper causes <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> problem and nickel suppresses the effect of copper. In this paper, the behaviour of copper and nickel during oxidation is investigated. Steels containing copper and nickel were oxidized and the distribution of copper and nickel in the scale was examined. It was found that copper is not only enriched at the scale/metal interface but also exists in upper magnetite layer as a state of solid solution and along grain boundaries of the wustite layer as metal phase. From these results an assumption has been proposed that the liquid copper migrates from the scale/metal interface to the magnetite layer along the grain boundaries. On the other hand, nickel enriched in steel side near the scale/metal interface with copper. The metal particles containing nickel and copper remain inside the scale. Nickel also has an effect of the uneven scale/metal interface formation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{beneficial}} effect of B {{on the hot}} ductility of 20 CrMnTi steel with 0. 05 % Sn was investigated. The results {{show that there is}} a trough in the hot ductility-temperature curve. With the increase in the B content, the trough shifts to a lower temperature and becomes shallow, and the hot brittle range becomes narrow. In addition, B greatly enhanc-ing the hot ductility was due mainly to its suppressing the Sn segregation, retarding the austenite/ferrite deformation, accelerating the onset of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and promoting the intragranular nucleation of ferrite. Moreover, in the present case, adding 92 ppm B can nucleation of ferrite. Moreover, in the present case, adding 92 ppm B can obtain the best effect in improving the hot ductility of 20 CrMnTi steel with 0. 05 % Sn.

40|$|Scrap {{iron and}} steel has long been {{considered}} a resource in the steel-making industry, and its value is largely determined by its impurity content. As the mini-mills, the major consumers of scrap {{iron and steel}}, expand into producing flat-rolled sheet, the demand for high-quality scrap will increase. Of the impurities present in scrap, copper is particularly troublesome because of its role in causing <b>hot</b> <b>shortness.</b> Therefore, the copper content of scrap should be kept below {approx} 0. 1 wt%. A method for removing copper from steel {{could be used to}} improve the quality of scrap and make it more available for use by mini-mills. To determine the effectiveness of a binary slag consisting of aluminum sulfide and iron sulfide on the removal of copper from steel and iron, the distribution coefficient of copper between the slag and a carbon-saturated iron melt was investigated at 1, 365 C. The composition of the slag was varied from nearly pure aluminum sulfide to pure iron sulfide. A maximum distribution coefficient of 30 was found, and the copper level in the iron melt was reduced to as low as 0. 07 wt. % with a 4 : 1 ratio of iron to slag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Application of {{a systems}} {{approach}} to computational materials design {{led to the}} theoretical design of a transformation toughened ultratough high-strength plate steel for blast-resistant naval hull applications.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that sulfur segregates to grain {{boundaries}} in nickel and causes <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> [1 - 3]. At lower sulfnr levels (2 - 20 ppm), the concentration of sulfur at grain boundaries is sufficient to cause high temperature embrittlement while at higher concentrations, embrittlement occurs even at lower temperatures [2, 3]. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of sulfur impurity on the processing map for hot working of nickel. For this purpose, processing maps have been developed on pure nickel with no trace of sulfur and on commercial purity nickel with 20 ppm sulfiar. Since a separate study has revealed that the processing map is also influenced by the presence of carbon impurity, the carbon content in the two different nickel materials is kept nearly the same (0. 02 wt%). The processing maps are developed using the approach of the Dynamic Materials Model [4, 5] which considers the workpiece under hot working conditions as a dissipator of power. The variation of the efficiency of power dissipation given by [2 m/(m+l) ], where m is the strain rate senstivity of flow stress with temperature and strain rate, constitutes the power dissipation map. In addition, a continuum criterion for the onset of instabilities is used in combination with the power dissipation map for avoiding an unstable flow regime during hot deformation [5, 6]...|$|E
40|$|Crack-free {{magnesium}} joints of AZ 31 {{magnesium alloy}} strips were produced using laser assisted self-piercing riveting (LSPR).

Thus, cracking was prevented not only in the bottom ply, but also in the top ply, and crack-free AZ 31 joints as thick as 6. 6 mm could be produced within 5 s cycle time. It was found that cracks during joining initiated in shear zones which formed due to limited dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) and strain localisation in regions of large and variable grain size. Since DRX is enhanced at higher temperatures, cracking was prevented by preheating to higher temperatures, up to a maximum temperature to avoid incipient melting and <b>hot</b> <b>shortness.</b> The strength of the joints was affected by the rivet length and hardness, which influenced the characteristics of the joints such as the interlock of the rivet leg into the bottom ply.

Salt spray testing showed there was no corrosion issue for the various coated steel rivets, and little or no corrosion around the rivet head in either the steel or the magnesium, but significant corrosion occurred some distance from the coated rivet.

40|$|The {{continuous}} heating {{to fracture}} test (CHF) developed at McGill {{was used to}} study the effect of decarburization on the incipient melting temperature. In the CHF test, a sample was deformed at a constant true strain rate, while its temperature is increased at a constant rate. This test allows the incipient melting temperature to be determined using a single test, instead of the several required by isothermal tensile testing. An isothermal decarburization step, to create a decarburized layer at {{the surface of the}} sample, was added prior to the CHF test. Analysis of the true stress vs temperature curves obtained by CHF testing allows the incipient melting temperature to be determined. Optical metallography was used to determine the effect of decarburization time on the observed depth of decarburization. The heat transfer characteristics of induction heating were studied, since this heating technique is known to create a significant temperature gradient at the surface of the piece being heated. Since the decarburized layer is in the high temperature zone, and also has a higher melting point due to its lower carbon content, it {{plays an important role in}} the melting process. A phenomenological model was derived to describe the melting process. It allows for both the temperature gradient due to induction heating and the melting point gradient due to decarburization. The hypothesis is advanced that melting takes place at the position, within the sample, where the temperature profile crosses the incipient melting temperature gradient. From this study, it appears that decarburization acts so as to limit the risk of <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> on a workpiece being forged at high temperatures. This is because decarburization raises the IMT, and in this way widens the temperature window of optimum workability...|$|E

OAl- 0. 7 Zn- 0. 13 Mn) die cast {{specimens}} {{were subjected to}} torsion testing at 150, 180, 240, 300, 420 and 450 C̕ at 0. 05 0. 5 and 5. 0 s - 1 The as-cast specimens exhibited <b>hot</b> <b>shortness</b> at 360 C̕ and above; however in that domain, after prior thermomechanical processing (TMP) at 300 C̕, they showed much improved properties (which were reported along with as-cast properties at 300 C̕ and below). For AZ 31 -Mn (Mg- 3. 2 Al- 1 - 1 Zn- 0. 34 Mn), AZ 31 (Mg- 2 - 8 Al- 0 - 88 Zn- 0. 01 Mn), AZ 63 (Mg- 5 - 5 Al- 2. 7 Zn- 0. 34 Mn) and ZK 60 (Mg- 5. 7 Zn- 0. 65 Zr-O-O 1 A]), the specimens were subjected to hot torsion testing in the range 180 to 450 C̕ and 0. 01, 0. 1, and 1. 0 s - 1. In the temperature range below 300 C̕ flow curves rise to a peak with failure occurring immediately thereafter. Above 300 C̕ the flow curves exhibited a peak and a gradual decline towards steady state. The temperature and strain rate dependence of the strength is described by a sinh-Arrhenius equation with Q HW between 125 and 144 kJ/mol; this indicates control by climb in comparison with creep in the range 200 - 400 C̕. The alloy strength and activation energy declined in the order AZ 63, AZ 31 -Mn AZ 91, AZ 31 and ZK 60, while ductility increased with decreasing strength. In working of Mg alloys from 150 to 450 C̕, the flow curves harden to a peak and work soften to a steady state regime above 300 C̕. At temperatures below 300 C̕, twinning is observed initially to bring grains into more suitable slip orientations. At high T a substructure develops due to basal and prismatic slip, Forming cells of augmented misorientation first near the grain boundaries and later towards the grain cores. Near the peak, new grains appear along the old boundaries (mantle) {{as a result of}} dynamic recrystallization DRX but not in the core of the initial grains. As T rises, the new grains are larger and the mantle broader, enhanced DRX results in higher ductility. At intermediate T, shear bands form through alignment of mantle zones resulting in reduced grain sizes and higher misorientation. Dynamic recrystallization does not become general as in Cu or Ni, thus it does not markedly raise the ductility. Retention of the hot worked substructure, or the refined grains, improves the strength and ductility of the product...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays a vast {{majority}} of the steel produced worldwide is via the continuous casting process route because this is the most low-cost, efficient and high quality method to mass produce metal products in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most of the continuous casters are the initial manufacturing step of a product which is very close to the final shape, reducing the need for further finishing. During continuous casting the liquid steel is solidified under controlled conditions of heat extraction to a semi-finished product that can subsequently be processed until final shape is reached. However, there is no perfect process and cracking during solidification of continuously cast steel slabs {{has been one of the}} main problems in casting for many years. In literature many terms are used for the phenomenon of crack formation at temperatures close to the solidus temperature, e. g. hot tearing, <b>hot</b> <b>shortness,</b> hot cracking or solidification cracking. Regardless of the name, hot tears represent a failure that occurs during casting in the regions of a solidifying slab that are at temperatures between solidus (TS) and liquidus (TL) and are subjected to simultaneously acting tensile and compressive stresses. The three steel grades considered in this study are a Low carbon aluminium killed (LCAK) steel grade, a high strength low alloyed (HSLA) steel grade, micro-alloyed with extra additions of vanadium, nitrogen and niobium, and a low-range HSLA (LR-HSLA), with the same concentration of niobium but a lower concentration of vanadium and nitrogen. The purpose of this study has been to investigate the differences between these three steel grades, with respect to hot tearing sensitivity upon solidifying in a thin slab caster. This research originates from the industrial demand for defect-free high-speed casting of steels and this thesis focuses on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of steel grades in relation to the solidification conditions in the continuous casting mould. Although these steel grades are not very different in chemical composition, thermodynamic calculations showed that the two HSLA steel grades have different propensity to the peritectic reaction upon solidification due to the combination of elements in the chemical composition that are either ferrite or austenite stabilisers. In order to better understand the special behaviour of the HSLA grade, compared with the LR-HSLA and the potential precipitation of TiN, phase field microstructure simulations have been performed, showing that TiN can form already during the latest stage of solidification, even when very low amounts of this element are present. If TiN particles trigger the coalescence of dendrite trunks, then it is possible to understand why, for a given Ti content an increased N content present in the HSLA grade can help to reduce the risk of hot tearing. Segregating elements in steel can influence the hot tearing susceptibility as they can widen the brittle temperature range (?TB), displacing its lower limit to lower temperatures. Unique hot tensile tests were carried out in the temperature range involving solidification, where the results suggest that among the studied steel grades, the LCAK steel grade has the lowest strength during solidification and a broader ?TB. Fractographic studies of the samples fractures above the non-equilibrium solidus revealed low melting phases even at temperatures as low as 1360 ºC. These low-melting films do have an effect on the hot tearing behaviour of commercial steel grades. The LCAK is particularly prone to develop non-metallic particles at the last stages of solidification. Whilst the study with the Mould Cracking Simulator did not confirm the increased hot tearing susceptibility of the LCAK and LR-HSLA, it did partially substantiate that the modifications on its design are novel in the way that no other physical model of cracking during continuous casting is able to simulate the process in such a way that it resembles the industrial process. Despite the alloys tested during the first few experiments were not the same alloy compositions studied in this thesis, the results of the Mould Cracking Simulator are very promising. It is expected that this new physical model will help in the study of the thermomechanical properties of commercial steels motivated by the continuous trend towards improved casting productivity by increasing casting speed and higher quality, as well as for the development of new steel grades.
