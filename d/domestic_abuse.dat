40|$|This study {{investigated}} the Moravian Church’s response to <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> among couples in Mbeya Municipality. The aim was {{to find out the}} nature, causes and reasons of <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> and the measures taken. The study utilized ecological systems, systematic theology and anthropological theories. The methodology employed included: field work research in collecting and analysing data through quantitative and qualitative methods; SPSS was partially used as a processing, classifying and one of the presentation techniques; sample size was around 600 respondents randomly selected from the eligible adults men and women; those married, divorced, widowed or about to get married including church ministers. The study has revealed that since the Moravian theological teachings, theoretically, do not condone <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> and Moravian members worldwide share the ‘same’ background of Moravian traditions and teachings that encourage respect and dignity for every individual person. Then the Moravian Church in local settings and Mbeya Municipality has not significantly been able to contextualise from the original teachings of the Church and is in need of adjustments. Hence, diversity of cultures and traditions has a direct influence on the Moravian Church traditions and teachings in the local settings; as such condoning <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> systematically. Essentially, the Ndali and Nyakyusa traditions and other ethnic groups have a direct impact on how the Church operates in the study area, basically, on the principle that the husband {{is the head of the}} family. Literary, the Church is a more likely to be a patriarchal institution as long as males are more privileged than women in <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> are. Therefore, the study suggests that through redefining, redesigning and reformulating its teaching and practice by discussion with African cultural values the church will elucidate their views on <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> and identify unhealthy cultural values that condone ill-treatment to women and discourage them. Through the above initiatives, it is likely that the good African values will be taken on board for a better Church and a better world to live. The study further recommends that more women practitioners and researchers should be involved to examine cultural influences on <b>domestic</b> <b>abuses</b> in African families and Tanzania in order to acquire a balanced picture. Finally, it is high time for both men and women to work together to make a difference in the Moravian Church by involving more women in decision-making and authority organs...|$|R

The data were gathered by the 49 -item,Iranian <b>Domestic</b> Elder <b>Abuse</b> Questionnaire which was filled out through private interviews with the participants. Results: Mean score of elder abuse was 11. 84 (SD: 12. 70) of total 100. Of the participants, 79. 6 % (95 % CI: 74. 5 - 84. 6) experienced at least one type of abuse. Emotional neglect was the most reported abuse and physical abuse was the least reported. Abuse score was associated with age, education level, living status, and insurance status of elders. Further, those who reported history of gastrointestinal problems, dyslipidemia, respiratory diseases, sleep disorders,audiovisual problems, joints pain, hypertension, dental/oral problems, cardiovascular disease,urinary incontinence and disability, reported a statistically significant higher abuse score. Conclusion: Despite overall low rate of <b>domestic</b> elder <b>abuse,</b> its high prevalence indicates that some interventions are necessary to decrease <b>domestic</b> elder <b>abuse.</b> Emotional neglect of elders should be addressed more than other abuse types...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from <b>domestic</b> <b>abuse,</b> it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters.

On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the risk, need and responsivity (RNR) model in offending behaviour work in the 1990 ’s in the UK saw risk assessment aligned with the allocation and intensity of the supervision and resources applied in the Criminal Justice System and Allied Fields. Although perhaps not known {{at the time the}} implications of this for the <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse</b> sector would be significant. This paper takes a gendered analysis of <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse.</b> The introduction and {{adoption of}} the ‘risk model’ into <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse</b> ‘work’ with victims/survivors in the specialist support sector has been a matter of mixed fortune. On the one hand a stronger connection with the statutory sector via the development of multi-agency partnership working on high risk cases and mobilising resources promptly at identified points of crisis has been enabled. On the other, <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse</b> victims/survivors have been poorly served by a system which allocates resources based on risk levels rather than need, and by an approach which fails to appreciate the fluid nature of <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse</b> and the importance of early intervention. The Change that Lasts programme (Women’s Aid 2016) is a strengths-based, needs-led model that supports survivors and their children to build resilience, leading to independence, which purports to respond to needs and risk, whilst advocating the importance of empowering women by responding to their self-defined needs. The model is currently being piloted in the UK and some early observational practice findings are explored in this paper. The paper concludes by asking whether the ‘needs led’ model ‘Change that Lasts’ is the Chance for Change for a Change that Lasts in addressing victims/survivors of <b>Domestic</b> Violence and <b>Abuse</b> ‘needs’ in the UK...|$|R
