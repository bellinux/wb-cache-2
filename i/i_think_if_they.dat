60|$|I {{jumped out}} and said I would bring the child to her, and I went up between the hedges with two lackeys behind me, till I came to a farmyard, where three or four children, muddy up to the very eyes, were quarrelling and playing with the water of a {{stagnant}} pool. I made my way through animals, dogs, and children, to the farm kitchen, where an old grandmother and a beggar sat on two chairs opposite to one another, {{on each side of}} the fire, and a young woman was busy over some raw joints of an animal. They stared at me with open mouths, and when I said that Madame la Comtesse d'Aubepine was come to see her child, and was waiting in the carriage, they looked as if such a thing had never been heard of before. The young woman began to cry--the old woman to grumble. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had dared, they would have flown into a passion, and I was really alarmed lest the child might be sick or even dead. I told them impressively who I was, and demanded that they would instantly show me the little one.|$|E
5000|$|Few {{confirmed}} {{details are}} {{known about the}} life of Maria Quitéria. She is briefly mentioned by English travel author Maria Graham (later Lady Callcott) in her book Journal of a Voyage to Brazil: [...] "Maria de Jesus is illiterate, but lively.

One observes nothing masculine in her conduct, rather she is of gentle and friendly manners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} {{misunderstood}} your arrangement, captain," [...] he said; [...] "for somehow, though how I do not exactly know--but somehow the alarm of the Arabs was no sooner given than I {{felt as if}} I {{ought to be in}} the launch to be at my post; but I suppose it was because I knew that the sails and spars that brought us here are mostly there, and that this was the spot to be most resolutely defended. <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had waded off to us, I should have fought like a tiger!" ...|$|R

"They may," [...] quoth <b>I,</b> [...] "well <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> {{anything}} that is true, that he liveth well where he is; for he now lives at and in the Fountain of Life, and has what he has without labor and sorrow; for there is no grief mixed therewith. But, pray, what talk have the people about him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I now {{began to}} wish I had not locked down the cover; I {{could have got}} out and walked ashore. But it was childish {{to give way to}} foolish regrets; so I lay {{perfectly}} quiet, and yelled. Presently I thought of my jack-knife. By this time the ship was so water-logged as {{to be a little more}} stable. This enabled me to get the knife from my pocket without upsetting more than six or eight times, and inspired hope. Taking the whittle between my teeth, I turned over upon my stomach, and cut a hole through the bottom near the bow. Turning back again, I awaited the result. Most men would have awaited the result, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could not have got out. For some time there was no result. The ship was too deeply laden astern, where my feet were, and water will not run up hill unless it is paid to do it. But when I called in all my faculties for a good earnest think, the weight of my intellect turned the scale. It was like a cargo of pig-lead in the forecastle. The water, which for nearly an hour I had kept down by drinking it as it rose about my lips, began to run out at the hole I had scuttled, faster than it could be admitted at the one in the stern; and in a few moments the bottom was so dry you might have lighted a match upon it, if you had been there, and obtained the captain's permission.|$|E
60|$|On the {{opposite}} side of this scale, ascending from the color pattern, I would place the various forms of painting which may be associated with architecture: primarily, and as most fit for such purpose, the mosaic, highly abstract in treatment, and introducing brilliant color in masses; the Madonna of Torcello being, as I think, the noblest type of the manner, and the Baptistery of Parma the richest: next, the purely decorative fresco, like that of the Arena Chapel; finally, the fresco becoming principal, as in the Vatican and Sistine. But I cannot, with any safety, follow the principles of abstraction in this pictorial ornament; since the noblest examples of it appear to me to owe their architectural applicability to their archaic manner; and I think that the abstraction and admirable simplicity which render them fit media of the most splendid coloring, cannot be recovered by a voluntary condescension. The Byzantines themselves would not, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could have drawn the figure better, have used it for a color decoration; and that use, as peculiar to a condition of childhood, however noble and full of promise, cannot be included among those modes of adornment which are now legitimate or even possible. There is a difficulty in the management of the painted window for the same reason, which has not yet been met, and we must conquer that first, before we can venture to consider the wall as a painted window on a large scale. Pictorial subject, without such abstraction, becomes necessarily principal, or, at all events, ceases to be the architect's concern; its plan must be left to the painter after the completion of the building, as in the works of Veronese and Giorgione on the palaces of Venice.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} is no more than justice to him to say that the knowledge, where it has come to him, has come to him slowly; and I think it came (as most things of common sense come) rather vaguely and as in a vision--that is, by the mere look of things. The old Cobdenite {{employer}} was quite within his rights in arguing that earth is not heaven, that the best obtainable arrangement might contain many necessary evils; and that Liverpool and Belfast might be growing more prosperous as a whole in spite of pathetic things that might be seen there. But I simply do not believe {{he has been able to}} look at Liverpool and Belfast and continue to think this: that is why he has turned himself into a sham country gentleman. Earth is not heaven, but the nearest we can get to heaven ought not to look like hell; and Liverpool and Belfast look like hell, whether they are or not. Such cities might be growing prosperous as a whole, though a few citizens were more miserable. But it was more and more broadly apparent that it was exactly and precisely as a whole that they were not growing more prosperous, but only the few citizens who were growing more prosperous by their increasing misery. You could not say a country was becoming a white man's country when there were more and more black men in it every day. You could not say a community was more and more masculine when it was producing more and more women. Nor can you say that a city is growing richer and richer when more and more of its inhabitants are very poor men. There might be a false agitation founded on the pathos of individual cases in a community pretty normal in bulk. But the fact is that no one can take a cab across Liverpool without having a quite complete and unified impression that the pathos is not a pathos of individual cases, but a pathos in bulk. People talk of the Celtic sadness; but there are very few things in Ireland that look so sad as the Irishman in Liverpool. The desolation of Tara is cheery compared with the desolation of Belfast. I recommend Mr. Yeats and his mournful friends to turn their attention to the pathos of Belfast. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> hung up the harp that once in Lord Furness's factory, there would be a chance of another string breaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Could anyone {{feel much}} sympathy," [...] she asked, [...] "with those men? Red Gallagher, {{as they all}} called him, {{is more like a}} great brute animal than a human being. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had sentenced him to death I should have felt that it was quite the proper thing to have done." ...|$|R
5000|$|They're not musicians, and don't {{claim to}} be—which {{makes it easier}} to be around them. Like, the song's in A minor or something, then it goes to D7, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> remember, <b>they</b> put some of the A minor solo on the D7, or some of the D7 stuff on the A minor chord at the end. So it sounds really different. And the more {{unconventional}} it sounds, the more they like it.|$|R

I mind Mr. Dishart admonishin' him for no attendin' {{a special}} weather service i' the kirk, when Finny an' Lintool, the twa adjoinin' farmers, baith attendit. 'Ou,' says Little Rathie, 'I thocht to mysel, <b>thinks</b> <b>I,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> get rain for prayin' for't on Finny an' Lintool, we're bound {{to get the}} benefit o't on Little Rathie.'" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{statement}} looks unamiable, {{and what}} probably {{happened was that}} I felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by an experiment that had brought me only chagrin. I {{was out in the}} cold while, by the evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase for which I myself had sounded the horn. They did as I had done, only more deliberately and sociably--they went over their author from the beginning. There was no hurry, Corvick said the future was before them and the fascination could only grow; they would take him page by page, as they would take one of the classics, inhale him in slow draughts and let him sink all the way in. They would scarce have got so wound up, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> hadn't been in love: poor Vereker's inner meaning gave them endless occasion to put and to keep their young heads together. None the less it represented the kind of problem for which Corvick had a special aptitude, drew out the particular pointed patience of which, had he lived, he would have given more striking and, it is to be hoped, more fruitful examples. He at least was, in Vereker's words, a little demon of subtlety. We had begun by disputing, but I soon saw that without my stirring a finger his infatuation would have its bad hours. He would bound off on false scents as I had done-- he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown out by the wind of the turned page. He was like nothing, I told him, but the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic character of Shakespeare. To this he replied that if we had had Shakespeare's own word for his being cryptic he would at once have accepted it. The case there was altogether different--we had nothing but the word of Mr. Snooks. I returned that I was stupefied to see him attach such importance even to the word of Mr. Vereker. He wanted thereupon to know if I treated Mr. Vereker's word as a lie. I wasn't perhaps prepared, in my unhappy rebound, to go so far as that, but I insisted that till the contrary was proved I should view it as too fond an imagination. I didn't, I confess, say--I didn't at that time quite know--all I felt. Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant. At the core of my disconcerted state--for my wonted curiosity lived in its ashes--was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at last probably come out somewhere. He made, in defence of his credulity, a great point of the fact that from of old, in his study of this genius, he had caught whiffs and hints of he didn't know what, faint wandering notes of a hidden music. That was just the rarity, that was the charm: it fitted so perfectly into what I reported.|$|E

60|$|I am {{well aware}} that some benevolent persons, to whom {{humanity}} owes much, regard Coolie immigration to the West Indies with some jealousy, fearing, and not unnaturally, that it may degenerate {{into a sort of}} slave-trade. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> will study the last immigration ordinance enacted by the Governor of Trinidad, June 24, 1870, and the report of the Agent-General of Immigrants for the year ending September 30, 1869, their fears will be set at rest as far as this colony is concerned. Of other colonies I say nothing, simply because I know nothing: save that, if there are defects and abuses elsewhere, the remedy is simple: namely, to adopt the system of Trinidad, and work it as it is worked there.|$|R

The other two methods would certainly have done Mr. Shaw more justice: the reporter should either have taken down verbatim what the speaker really said about Capital, or have given an outline {{of the way in which}} this idea was connected with the idea about patriotic songs.|$|R
