25|$|Eventually, <b>Estragon</b> dozes off and Vladimir rouses him {{but then}} stops {{him before he}} can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. <b>Estragon</b> wants to hear an old joke, which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded <b>Estragon</b> suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When <b>Estragon</b> declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which <b>Estragon</b> idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E
25|$|It is daytime {{again and}} Vladimir begins singing a {{recursive}} round {{about the death}} of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings. Again, <b>Estragon</b> claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury. Vladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections of yesterday against Estragon's extremely vague, unreliable memory. Vladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day's events by showing <b>Estragon</b> the wound from when Lucky kicked him. Noticing Estragon's barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which <b>Estragon</b> insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly. With no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering <b>Estragon</b> a turnip or a radish. He then sings <b>Estragon</b> to sleep with a lullaby before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky's hat still lies on the ground. This leads to his waking <b>Estragon</b> and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene. The two then wait again for Godot, while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routinesall of which fail miserably and end quickly.|$|E

25|$|A new {{production}} directed by Sean Mathias began previews at the Cort Theatre on Broadway in late October 2013, with Ian McKellen as <b>Estragon,</b> Patrick Stewart as Vladimir, Billy Crudup as Lucky and Shuler Hensley as Pozzo.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, a {{production}} was staged by Walter Asmus at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City with Sam Waterston as Vladimir, Austin Pendleton as <b>Estragon,</b> Milo O'Shea as Lucky and Michael Egan as Pozzo.|$|E
25|$|For Ontario's Stratford Festival's 61st {{season in}} 2013, Jennifer Tarver {{directed}} a new {{production at the}} Tom Patterson Theatre starring Brian Dennehy as Pozzo, Stephen Ouimette as <b>Estragon,</b> Tom Rooney as Vladimir and Randy Hughson as Lucky.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Pontedera Theatre Foundation won {{a similar}} claim in 2006 when it cast two actresses in {{the roles of}} Vladimir and <b>Estragon,</b> albeit in the characters' {{traditional}} roles as men. At the 1995 Acco Festival, director Nola Chilton staged a production with Daniella Michaeli {{in the role of}} Lucky.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, Pozzo and Lucky reappear, but {{the rope}} is much shorter than during their last visit, and Lucky now guides Pozzo, {{rather than being}} {{controlled}} by him. As they arrive, Pozzo trips over Lucky and they together fall into a motionless heap. <b>Estragon</b> sees an opportunity to exact revenge on Lucky for kicking him earlier. The issue is debated lengthily until Pozzo shocks the pair by revealing {{that he is now}} blind and Lucky is now mute. Pozzo further claims to have lost all sense of time, and assures the others that he cannot remember meeting them before, but also does not expect to recall today's events tomorrow. His commanding arrogance from yesterday appears to have been replaced by humility and insight. His parting wordswhich Vladimir expands upon laterare ones of utter despair. Lucky and Pozzo depart; meanwhile <b>Estragon</b> has again fallen asleep.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 2009, a {{production}} with Sir Ian McKellen as <b>Estragon</b> and Sir Patrick Stewart as Vladimir, {{opened at the}} Haymarket Theatre in London's West End. Their performances received critical acclaim, and were {{the subject of an}} eight-part documentary series called Theatreland, which was produced by Sky Arts. The production was revived at the same theatre in January 2010 for 11 weeks and, in 2010 toured internationally, with Roger Rees replacing Stewart as Vladimir.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} of the play in the United States was at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Coconut Grove, Florida on 3 January 1956. It starred Tom Ewell as Vladimir and Bert Lahr as <b>Estragon.</b> It bombed, but a Broadway version with Lahr, a new director (Herbert Berghof), and E. G. Marshall as Vladimir met with much more favour. The production and its problems are described in Notes on a Cowardly Lion, John Lahr's book about his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} revived in London's West End at the Queen's Theatre in a {{production}} directed by Les Blair, which opened on 30 September 1991. This {{was the first}} West End revival since the play's British premi√®re. Rik Mayall played Vladimir and Adrian Edmondson played <b>Estragon,</b> with Philip Jackson as Pozzo and Christopher Ryan as Lucky; the boy was played by Dean Gaffney and Duncan Thornley. Derek Jarman provided the scenic design, in collaboration with Madeleine Morris.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Edmondson and Mayall co-starred in the West End {{production}} of Beckett's Waiting for Godot at the Queen's Theatre, with Mayall playing Vladimir, Edmondson as <b>Estragon</b> and Christopher Ryan as Lucky. Here {{they came up}} with the idea for Bottom, which they said was a cruder cousin to Waiting for Godot. Bottom was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall appeared in Bottom as Richard 'Richie' Richard alongside Edmondson's Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured slapstick violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Stewart {{appeared}} alongside Ian McKellen as {{the lead}} duo of Vladimir (Didi) and <b>Estragon</b> (Gogo), in Waiting for Godot. Stewart had previously appeared only once alongside McKellen on stage, but the pair had developed a close friendship while waiting around on set filming the X-Men films. Stewart stated that performing in this play was the fulfilment of a 50-year ambition, having seen Peter O'Toole appear in it at the Bristol Old Vic while Stewart was just 17. Reviewers stated that his interpretation captured well the balance between humour and despair that characterises the work.|$|E
25|$|Gibson {{studied at}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney. The {{students}} at NIDA were classically trained in the British-theater tradition rather than in preparation for screen acting. As students, Gibson and actress Judy Davis played the leads in Romeo and Juliet, and Gibson {{played the role of}} Queen Titania in an experimental production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. After graduation in 1977, Gibson immediately began work on the filming of Mad Max, but continued to work as a stage actor, and joined the State Theatre Company of South Australia in Adelaide. Gibson's theatrical credits include the character <b>Estragon</b> (opposite Geoffrey Rush) in Waiting for Godot, and the role of Biff Loman in a 1982 production of Death of a Salesman in Sydney. Gibson's most recent theatrical performance, opposite Sissy Spacek, was the 1993 production of Love Letters by A. R. Gurney, in Telluride, Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. <b>Estragon</b> awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
500|$|Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett, (as <b>Estragon),</b> Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 2009 and 2010; Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, Australia, 2010 and Fugard Theatre, Cape Town, South Africa, 2010 ...|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{turned down}} the role of <b>Estragon</b> in Peter Hall's premiere of the English {{language}} version of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1955 and later reproached himself for missing {{the chance to be}} in [...] "the greatest play of my generation". He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson's Timon of Athens in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in The Waltz of the Toreadors for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957. [...] He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, Robert Bolt's Flowering Cherry, and Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover. The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957‚Äì58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene's comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film Our Man in Havana. Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted [...] "the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and No√´l Coward", faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{opens on}} an outdoor scene of two bedraggled companions: the {{philosophical}} Vladimir and the weary <b>Estragon</b> who, at the moment, cannot remove his boots from his aching feet, finally muttering, [...] "Nothing to be done." [...] Vladimir {{takes up the}} thought loftily, while <b>Estragon</b> vaguely recalls having been beaten the night before. Finally, his boots come off, while the pair ramble and bicker pointlessly. When <b>Estragon</b> suddenly decides to leave, Vladimir reminds him that they must stay and wait for an unspecified person called Godota segment of dialogue that repeats often. Unfortunately, the pair cannot agree on where or when {{they are expected to}} meet with this Godot. They only know to wait at a tree, and there is indeed a leafless one nearby.|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir and <b>Estragon</b> {{are often}} played with Irish accents, {{as in the}} Beckett on Film project. This, some feel, is an {{inevitable}} consequence of Beckett's rhythms and phraseology, {{but it is not}} stipulated in the text. At any rate, they are not of English stock: at one point early in the play, <b>Estragon</b> mocks the English pronunciation of [...] "calm" [...] and has fun with [...] "the story of the Englishman in the brothel".|$|E
2500|$|When Beckett {{started writing}} {{he did not}} have a visual image of Vladimir and <b>Estragon.</b> They are never {{referred}} to as tramps in the text, though are often performed in such costumes on stage. Roger Blin advises: [...] "Beckett heard their voices, but he couldn't describe his characters to me. : 'The only thing I'm sure of is that they're wearing bowlers.'" [...] "The bowler hat was of course de rigueur for male persons in many social contexts when Beckett was growing up in Foxrock, and [...] commonly wore one." [...] That said, the play does indicate that the clothes worn at least by <b>Estragon</b> are shabby. When told by Vladimir that he should have been a poet, <b>Estragon</b> says he was, gestures to his rags, and asks if it were not obvious.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reading is}} given further weight {{early in the}} first act when <b>Estragon</b> asks Vladimir {{what it is that}} he has {{requested}} from Godot: ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{clues about}} the {{location}} {{can be found in}} the dialogue. In Act I, Vladimir turns toward the auditorium and describes it as a bog. In Act II, Vladimir again motions to the auditorium and notes that there is [...] "Not a soul in sight." [...] When <b>Estragon</b> rushes toward the back of the stage in Act II, Vladimir scolds him, saying that [...] "There's no way out there." [...] Also in Act II, Vladimir comments that their surroundings look nothing like the Macon country, and <b>Estragon</b> states that he's lived his whole life [...] "Here! In the Cackon country!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir stands {{through most}} of the play whereas <b>Estragon</b> sits down {{numerous}} times and even dozes off. [...] "Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless." [...] Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. <b>Estragon</b> [...] "belongs to the stone", preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: [...] "Do you remember the Gospels?" [...] <b>Estragon</b> tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points {{to the fact that he}} may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Al Alvarez writes: [...] "But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time." [...] They have been together for fifty years but when asked‚Äìby Pozzo‚Äìthey do not reveal their actual ages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} spoofed as [...] "Waiting for Godot's Obamacare Replacement" [...] on a March 2017 showing of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert with the host playing {{the part of}} Vladimir while Sir Patrick Stewart played <b>Estragon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sydney Theatre staged Godot in November 2013 with Richard Roxburgh as <b>Estragon</b> and Hugo Weaving as Vladimir, Philip Quast as Pozzo. The {{production}} was originally {{to be directed}} by [...] who had to withdraw and Andrew Upton stepped in.|$|E
2500|$|... "A terrible cry" [...] heralds the {{entrance}} of Lucky, a silent, baggage-burdened slave with a rope tied around his neck, and Pozzo, his arrogant and imperious master, who holds the other end and stops now to rest. Pozzo barks abusive orders at Lucky, which are always quietly followed, while acting civilly though tersely towards the other two. Pozzo enjoys a selfish snack of chicken and wine, before casting the bones to the ground, which <b>Estragon</b> gleefully claims. Having been in a dumbfounded state of silence ever since the arrival of Pozzo and Lucky, Vladimir finally finds his voice to shout criticisms at Pozzo for his mistreatment of Lucky. Pozzo ignores this and explains his intention to sell Lucky, who begins to cry. <b>Estragon</b> takes pity and tries to wipe away Lucky's tears, but, as he approaches, Lucky violently kicks him in the shin. Pozzo then rambles nostalgically but vaguely {{about his relationship with}} Lucky over the years, before offering Vladimir and <b>Estragon</b> some compensation for their company. <b>Estragon</b> begins to beg for money when Pozzo instead suggests that Lucky can [...] "dance" [...] and [...] "think" [...] for their entertainment. Lucky's dance, [...] "the Net", is clumsy and shuffling; Lucky's [...] "thinking" [...] is a long-winded and disjointed monologueit is the first and only time that Lucky speaks. The soliloquy begins as a relatively coherent and academic lecture on theology but quickly dissolves into mindless verbosity, escalating in both volume and speed, that agonises the others until Vladimir finally pulls off Lucky's hat, stopping him in mid-sentence. Pozzo then has Lucky pack up his bags, and they hastily leave.|$|E
2500|$|Their mutual need is ‚Äúclear and the {{advantages}} of a symbiotic relationship seem obvious, in theory at least ‚Ä¶ [...] the same juxtaposition of contradictory impulses and striking ambivalence of behaviour that was present in the relationship of <b>Estragon</b> and Vladimir and of Hamm and Clov.‚Äù ...|$|E
2500|$|... ‚ÄúA (Bertrand) is more practical, better {{organised}} {{and more}} knowledgeable; B is more nervous, hot-tempered {{and prone to}} use oaths and four-letter words and, although less sensitive than A, {{he is capable of}} graphic turns of phrase ‚Ä¶ A and B are bound together by mutual needs but ‚Ä¶ this symbiotic relationship is as subject to irritability and impatience as that of <b>Estragon</b> and Vladimir had been.‚Äù ...|$|E
2500|$|Vivian Mercier {{described}} Waiting for Godot as a play which [...] "has {{achieved a}} theoretical impossibility‚Äîa play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, {{since the second}} act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.". Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: [...] "It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound {{as if they had}} earned PhDs. 'How do you know they hadn't?' was his reply." [...] They clearly have known better times, a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rh√¥ne; it is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon's claim to have been a poet, an explanation <b>Estragon</b> provides to Vladimir for his destitution. In the first stage production, which Beckett oversaw, both are [...] "more shabby-genteel than ragged...Vladimir at least is capable of being scandalised...on a matter of etiquette when <b>Estragon</b> begs for chicken bones or money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas {{began to}} study Beckett's works and his next video work Panoramic Rotunda (1985) came from misremembering a line from Beckett's FIzzle No. 7. The {{repetition}} and seemingly endless loops of the same narrative in Win, Place or Show recalls Beckett's use of repetition to point to but also undermine the [...] "sameness" [...] of reality. The absurdity of the forever repeating narrative, of the two protagonists in an endless loop, always the same words but from different points of reference is an allusion to Vladimir and <b>Estragon</b> in Waiting for Godot.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the play}} the couple refer {{to each other}} by the pet names [...] "Didi" [...] and [...] "Gogo", {{although}} the boy addresses Vladimir as [...] "Mister Albert". Beckett originally intended to call <b>Estragon</b> [...] "L√©vy" [...] but when Pozzo questions him he gives his name as [...] "Magr√©gor, Andr√©" [...] and also responds to [...] "Catulle" [...] in French or [...] "Catullus" [...] in the first Faber edition. This became [...] "Adam" [...] in the American edition. Beckett's only explanation {{was that he was}} [...] "fed up with Catullus".|$|E
