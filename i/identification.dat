40|$|This article {{examines}} the cultural dilemmas proceeding from the multiple <b>identifications</b> of Kurdish migrants working in the multicultural environment of Istanbul's tourist industry. Since <b>identifications</b> invariably multiply when migrants enter multicultural environments, the question emerges how migrants cope with increasing <b>identifications?</b> How are multiple <b>identifications</b> related within the self? In this article, these questions are addressed, first, by analysing how Kurds explain ethnic stereotypes of themselves with reference to migration from the region of origin. Furthermore, conflicts and ambiguities between <b>identifications</b> as individual migrant and <b>identifications</b> as family member are investigated. Third, <b>identifications</b> of the 'villager' versus the 'urbanite' are reviewed, while, finally, the role of 'learning' in the migration process for Kurdish <b>identifications</b> will be highlighted. Dialogical self theory is used to situate the analysis of cultural dilemmas and contradictions of Kurdish migrants in Istanbul within the broader study of multiple <b>identifications</b> of migrants in multicultural societies...|$|R

40|$|PRIDE, the ‘PRoteomics <b>IDEntifications</b> {{database}}’ () is {{a database}} of protein and peptide <b>identifications</b> that have been described in the scientific literature. These <b>identifications</b> will typically be from specific species, tissues and sub-cellular locations, perhaps under specific disease conditions. Any post-translational modifications that have been identified on individual peptides can be described. These <b>identifications</b> may be annotated with supporting mass spectra. At the time of writing, PRIDE includes the full set of <b>identifications</b> as submitted by individual laboratories participating in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project and {{a profile of the}} human platelet proteome submitted by the University of Ghent in Belgium. By late 2005 PRIDE is expected to contain the <b>identifications</b> and spectra generated by the HUPO Brain Proteome Project.

Data can be submitted in PRIDE XML format if <b>identifications</b> are included or mzData format if the submitter is depositing mass spectra without <b>identifications.</b> PRIDE is a web application, so submission, searching and data retrieval can all be performed using an internet browser. PRIDE can be searched by experiment accession number, protein accession number, literature reference and sample parameters including species, tissue, sub-cellular location and disease state.

40|$|Most {{proteomics}} studies {{attempt to}} maximize the number of peptide <b>identifications</b> and subsequently infer proteins containing two or more peptides as reliable protein <b>identifications.</b> In this study, we evaluate {{the effect of this}} “two-peptide ” rule on protein <b>identifications,</b> using multiple search tools and data sets. Contrary to the intuition, the “two-peptide ” rule reduces the number of protein <b>identifications</b> in the target database more significantly than in the decoy database and results in increased false discovery rates, compared to the case when single-hit proteins are not discarded. We therefore recommend that the “two-peptide ” rule should be abandoned, and instead, protein <b>identifications</b> should be subject to the estimation of error rates, {{as is the case with}} peptide <b>identifications.</b> We further extend the generating function approach (originally proposed for evaluating matches between a peptide and a single spectrum) to evaluating matches between a protein and an entire spectral data set...|$|R

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{computational}} proteomics is distinguishing between correct and false peptide <b>identifications.</b> We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide <b>identifications</b> {{is not unlike}} computing generating functions in combinatorics.

We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide <b>identifications</b> in MS/MS searches...|$|R
40|$|Staged crime {{research}} has demonstrated the utility of controlling the conduct of lineups {{as a means of}} reducing false <b>identifications</b> with little or no apparent decline in the rate of correct <b>identifications</b> by eyewitnesses (e. g., Lindsay & Wells, 1980; Malpass & Devine, 1981 a; Wells, 1984). A recent variation in lineup procedure shows that a blank lineup, which includes no suspects, can reduce the rate of false <b>identifications</b> if it precedes the actual lineup. However, there are several practical problems that make it unlikely that police will accept this procedure. Sequential lineup presentation is proposed as a means of accomplishing the same goals of reducing false <b>identifications</b> with little or no loss in accurate <b>identifications.</b> A crime was staged for 240 unsuspecting eyewitnesses either individually or in pairs. One quarter of the eyewitnesses attempted <b>identifications</b> in each of four lineup conditions: Six pictures were presented either simultaneously, as used in traditional procedures, or sequentially, in which yes/no judgments were made for each picture; each procedure either contained the photograph of the criminal-confederate or a picture of a similar looking replacement.

5|$|The Egyptian <b>identification</b> card {{controversy}} {{began in}} the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government <b>identification</b> documents (such as national <b>identification</b> cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain <b>identification</b> documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.

40|$|While {{collective}} <b>identifications</b> of diasporic Kurds {{have attracted}} considerable scholarly interest, their possible role in familial processes of post-trauma reconstruction has hardly been studied. The {{aim of this}} article is therefore to develop an explorative understanding of the deployment and meaning of collective <b>identifications</b> in intimate family contexts by examining the interconnectedness between the transmission of cultural and political belonging and post-trauma meaning-making and coping in Kurdish refugee families. After contextualising diasporic Kurds’ collective <b>identifications</b> through an ethnographic depiction of the Kurdish diasporic community in Belgium, this article reports on findings from a small-scale, exploratory study with five Kurdish refugee families in Belgium. Thematic analysis of family and parent interviews indicates how cultural and political <b>identifications</b> may operate as sources of (1) dealing with cultural bereavement and loss; (2) commemorating trauma; and (3) reversing versus reiterating trauma.
