25|$|MDPE {{is defined}} by a <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of 0.926–0.940nbsp&g/cm3. MDPE can be {{produced}} by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, or metallocene catalysts. MDPE has good shock and drop resistance properties. It also is less notch-sensitive than HDPE; stress-cracking resistance is better than HDPE. MDPE is typically used in gas pipes and fittings, sacks, shrink film, packaging film, carrier bags, and screw closures.|$|E
25|$|VLDPE {{is defined}} by a <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of 0.880–0.915nbsp&g/cm3. VLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer {{with high levels of}} short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.|$|E

25|$|LDPE {{is defined}} by a <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of 0.910–0.940nbsp&g/cm3. LDPE has {{a high degree of}} short- and {{long-chain}} branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the crystal structure as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction is less. This results in a lower tensile strength and increased ductility. LDPE is created by free-radical polymerization. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable flow properties. LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film wrap. In 2013, the global LDPE market had a volume of almost US$33 billion.|$|E
25|$|LLDPE {{is defined}} by a <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|E

Surveys have shown it {{to be limited to}} highly {{fragmented}} forests surrounding the town of Daraina in an area encircled by the Loky and Manambato rivers in northeastern Madagascar. [...] The golden-crowned sifaka has one of the smallest geographic ranges of all indriid lemur species. Out of 75forest fragments studied by researchers, its presence could be definitively reported in only 44, totaling [...] This study, published in 2002, also estimated the total species population and observed population densities.

However, a study published in 2010 using line transect data from 2006 and 2008 in five major forest fragments yielded an estimated population of 18,000 individuals.|$|E

500|$|Kepler-11b is {{estimated}} to be ≤3.3 Earth masses and 1.8 Earth radii, making it around three times (or less) as massive and nearly twice as large as Earth. While the radius of Kepler-11b is fairly well known (with a range of likely radii between 1.75 and 1.83 Earth radii), the mass is not as well constrained, with a range between 0.9 and 3.3 Earth masses. The mass is determined using transit timing variations of Kepler-11c, and is limited by the quality of the data. [...] Kepler-11b is the closest planet to its host star in the Kepler-11 planetary system. With an estimated density of 1.7 g/cm3, comparable to Neptune's, Kepler-11b is denser than the solar system's gas giants but significantly less dense than the terrestrial planets. The estimated <b>density</b> <b>range</b> suggests that it is not of Earth-like composition, yet it is nonetheless composed mostly of elements heavier than helium. The planet's effective temperature is 900 K, and is thus the hottest of the planets discovered in the Kepler-11 system. Kepler-11b orbits its host star every 10.30375 days at a distance of [...]091 AU. Planet Mercury, in comparison, orbits the Sun every 87.97 days from a distance of [...]387 AU. Kepler-11b's inclination of 88.5° means that it deviates slightly from the orbital plane, but it does so more than the other five planets with which Kepler-11b was discovered. [...] Its close proximity to the star implies a strong insolation, which caused the planet to lose all of light-element envelope acquired during formation. [...] The observed low density does require the presence of a gaseous envelope though, which was most likely produced via outgassing of hydrogen or evaporation of H2O from the condensed core.|$|E
2500|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{the method}} of choice {{for the analysis of}} fecal coliforms in water. [...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface. [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a selective medium, growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{important}} parameter for {{a scanner}} is its <b>density</b> <b>range</b> (Dynamic Range) or Drange (see Densitometry). A high <b>density</b> <b>range</b> {{means that the}} scanner is able to record shadow details and brightness details in one scan. Density of film is measured on a base 10 log scale and varies between 0.0 (transparent) and 5.0, about 16 stops. [...] <b>Density</b> <b>range</b> is the space taken up in the 0 to 5 scale, and Dmin and Dmax denote where the least dense and most dense measurements on a negative or positive film. The <b>density</b> <b>range</b> of negative film is up to 3.6d, while slide film dynamic range is 2.4d. [...] Color negative <b>density</b> <b>range</b> after processing is 2.0d thanks to compression of the 12 stops into a small <b>density</b> <b>range.</b> Dmax will be the densest on slide film for shadows, and densest on negative film for highlights. Some slide films can have a Dmax close to 4.0d with proper exposure, and so can black-and-white negative film.|$|E
