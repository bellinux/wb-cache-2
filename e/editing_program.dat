A similar site, Something Awful, sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically pleasing image or to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill, which is then voted on by others in the forum.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Adobe {{introduced}} {{what was}} to become its flagship product, a graphics <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.|$|E
25|$|The IBM Selectric {{typewriter}} was {{a highly}} successful model line of electric typewriters introduced in 1961. Expensive Typewriter, written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a text <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> that ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first word processing program, but the term word processing itself was only introduced, by IBM's Böblingen Laboratory in the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|After {{principal}} photography was finished, {{the film}} was transferred to QuickTime for an 18-month animation process: interpolated rotoscoping. A Scanner Darkly was filmed digitally using the Panasonic AG-DVX100 and then animated with Rotoshop, a proprietary graphics <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> created by Bob Sabiston. Rotoshop uses an animation technique called interpolated rotoscope, which was previously used in Linklater's film Waking Life. Linklater discussed the ideas and inspiration behind his use of rotoscoping in Ashraf's documentary, linking it to his personal experiences of lucid dreaming. Rotoscoping in traditional cel animation originally involved tracing over film frame-by-frame. This is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of filmmaker Ralph Bakshi. Rotoshop animation makes use of vector keyframes and interpolates the in-between frames automatically.|$|E
500|$|A feature called [...] "Perfect Head", which {{appeared}} in previews of the game but {{was not included in}} the final product, was intended to take customisation of multiplayer profiles further. This feature allowed the player to place a photograph of their choice onto their in-game character's face, via a Game Boy Camera combined with the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. The images taken could be manipulated with a simple image <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> to adjust their brightness and position. They could then be saved to either the Nintendo 64 cartridge or a Controller Pak and then loaded onto a player's character in multiplayer, thus creating a virtual representation of the player. Although Rare officially said the feature was dropped due to [...] "technical difficulties", the actual reason was revealed to be [...] "sensitive issues" [...] surrounding the ability to attack images of real people. Rare's decision came after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} {{movements of}} the mouse on the surface are applied {{to the position of}} the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so hand movements are replicated by the pointer. Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called [...] "icons" [...] and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> to open the file in a window.|$|E

2500|$|Chocolate Castles core {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} a combination of mazes and sliding puzzles. The object of the game is to clear all blocks of chocolate in each room of a castle by getting anthropomorphic animals to eat them. Rooms are classed as easy, medium or hard. There are 120 rooms to complete in the full version of Chocolate Castle, with each difficulty level containing 40 puzzles. The trial version features 12 rooms. [...] Rooms can be skipped if the player finds them too difficult, any moves made during play can be undone should the puzzle become unsolvable due to error. The full version contains a room <b>editing</b> <b>program</b> allowing players to create their own puzzles. Further rooms created by other players can be obtained from Lexaloffle's bulletin board system online.|$|E
