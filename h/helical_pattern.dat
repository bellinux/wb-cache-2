Later developments would use balanced arrangements of ribs in a chevron or herringbone layout. The more common arrangement for the later low-speed military bar grip was to use straight bars, but relying on the centre rib to avoid their vibration problems on tarmac.|$|E

40|$|An {{indirect}} exciton is a bound pair of {{an electron}} and a hole confined in spatially separated semiconductor layers. Long lifetimes of indirect excitons {{allow them to}} cool down to low temperatures below the temperature of quantum degeneracy. In coherent exciton gases the spin relaxation mechanisms linked with the scattering of particles are strongly suppressed. Recent experiments evidenced spontaneous coherence and condensation, phase singularities, spatial ordering, and polarization textures in a cold excitons gas. We develop a theoretical model accounting for the spin-orbit interaction of electrons and holes, exchange splitting of exciton states and Zeeman effect. This model describes the polarization patterns observed experimentally, including <b>helical</b> <b>patterns,</b> four-leaf patterns, spiral patterns, and bell patterns, and confirms that the polarization textures at low temperature manifest ballistic propagation of cold excitons over the distances exceeding the exciton Bohr radius by 3 orders of magnitude and the exciton thermal De Broglie wavelength by more than an order of magnitude.

This theory shows that DNA braiding may be affected, stabilized, or even driven by chiral electrostatic interactions. For example, electrostatically driven braiding may explain the surprising recent observation of stable pairing of homologous double-stranded DNA in solutions containing only monovalent salt.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{years of}} {{intensive}} research, {{much remains to}} be discovered to understand the regulatory networks coordinating bacterial cell growth and division. The mechanisms by which Streptococcus pneumoniae achieves its characteristic ellipsoid-cell shape remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the interplay of the cell division paralogs DivIVA and GpsB with the ser/thr kinase StkP. We observed that the deletion of divIVA hindered cell elongation and resulted in cell shortening and rounding. By contrast, the absence of GpsB resulted in hampered cell division and triggered cell elongation. Remarkably, ΔgpsB elongated cells exhibited a <b>helical</b> FtsZ <b>pattern</b> instead of a Z-ring, accompanied by <b>helical</b> <b>patterns</b> for DivIVA and peptidoglycan synthesis. Strikingly, divIVA deletion suppressed the elongated phenotype of ΔgpsB cells. These data suggest that DivIVA promotes cell elongation and that GpsB counteracts it. Analysis of protein-protein interactions revealed that GpsB and DivIVA do not interact with FtsZ but with the cell division protein EzrA, which itself interacts with FtsZ. In addition, GpsB interacts directly with DivIVA. These results are consistent with DivIVA and GpsB acting as a molecular switch to orchestrate peripheral and septal PG synthesis and connecting them with the Z-ring via EzrA. The cellular co-localization of the transpeptidases PBP 2 x and PBP 2 b as well as the lipid-flippases FtsW and RodA in ΔgpsB cells further suggest the existence of a single large PG assembly complex. Finally, we show that GpsB is required for septal localization and kinase activity of StkP, and therefore for StkP-dependent phosphorylation of DivIVA. Altogether, we propose that the StkP/DivIVA/GpsB triad finely tunes the two modes of peptidoglycan (peripheral and septal) synthesis responsible for the pneumococcal ellipsoid cell shape...|$|R
