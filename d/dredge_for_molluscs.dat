2500|$|Dredgers – use a <b>dredge</b> <b>for</b> {{collecting}} <b>molluscs</b> {{from the}} seafloor. There are {{three types of}} dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the shellfish from the ground. These dredges are towed {{in a manner similar}} to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side. [...] (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.|$|R
50|$|The Chards {{used the}} Hope, so christened {{because of the}} failing oyster harvests, to <b>dredge</b> <b>for</b> oysters for more than 10 years until the oyster beds were {{decimated}} by starfish. Then, Clarence Chard used Hope to <b>dredge</b> <b>for</b> clams until his retirement several years later.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1820 and 1865, {{the state}} of Maryland banned the {{practice}} of <b>dredging</b> <b>for</b> oysters. In the latter year, the law was relaxed; the use of steam power remained banned, however, and remained entirely prohibited until 1965, in which year powered dredging was allowed two days of the week. As long as <b>dredging</b> <b>for</b> oysters in the Chesapeake was prohibited, oystermen working from log canoes tonged for oysters. In 1854 the Maryland legislature permitted the use of dredges {{in the waters of}} Somerset County, Maryland, expanding the use of dredges {{to the rest of the}} Bay following the Civil War. Opening the Chesapeake to oyster dredging after the Civil War created a need for larger, more powerful boats to haul dredges across the oyster beds.|$|R
40|$|Snails of the Chotěbuzka stream basin were {{surveyed}} in 2005 by analysis flood debris. In total, 50 snail species were found. Comparisons with records {{elsewhere in the}} Těšín region show that this stream basin is very important <b>for</b> <b>molluscs.</b> The abandoned quarry of "Jeruzalém" in Stanislavice is the most favourable site <b>for</b> <b>molluscs,</b> since many stenotopic and endangered woodland species occur there (e. g. Oxychilus depressus, Daudebardia rufa). The presence of the snail Sphyradium doliolum (listed as "near threatened" in the Czech Red list) in the Czech part of the Těšín region is notable. The area of the abandoned quarry is not nowadays administered as a protected area, although it is very significant not only from a malacological viewpoint, but also geologically and floristically...|$|R

50|$|Toxicity <b>for</b> <b>molluscs</b> varies widely, with 48-hour LD50 {{found between}} 5 mg/l {{for the common}} limpet and 100 mg/l for the common periwinkle.

40|$|During {{the last}} 100 years four major types of {{dredging}} have impacted the bay: channel deepening, maintenance dredging, shell <b>dredging,</b> and <b>dredging</b> <b>for</b> landfill construction.

50|$|The {{skipjack}} arose {{near the}} end of the 19th century. <b>Dredging</b> <b>for</b> oysters, prohibited in 1820, was again made legal in 1865. Boats of the time were unsuitable, and the bugeye developed out of the log canoe in order to provide a boat with more power adapted to the shallow waters of the oyster beds.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of a shell in molluscs appears {{to be related to}} the secretion of ammonia, which originates from urea. The presence of an ammonium ion raises the pH of the extrapallial fluid, favouring the deposition of calcium carbonate. This mechanism has been proposed not only <b>for</b> <b>molluscs,</b> but also <b>for</b> other unrelated mineralizing lineages.|$|R
