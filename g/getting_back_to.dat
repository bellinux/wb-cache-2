5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E

Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao {{who happens to be}} around, recognizes Siddhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Hasini realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their face, Siddhu admonishes Hasini for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Aravind on Siddhu's choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart, leaving Aravind to repent on his over-protectiveness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the marriage. While they relent, Aravind manages to convince Kanaka Rao about Siddhu and Hasini's love. When Kanaka Rao disagrees to get the two lovers married, Aravid suggests letting Siddhu stay with them for a week and the story returns to the pre-credits scene.

25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E

25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of her album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna intended {{to embark on}} a new concert tour in 1999, but due to the delay of her film The Next Best Thing, it was cancelled. By 2000, Madonna was dating director Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant with their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, Music, instead of embarking on a tour. Buoyed up by the commercial success of her previous album, she was keen on <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the studio to record new music. Madonna was well disposed towards William Orbit, producer of Ray of Light, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Also, the music scene was being dominated by a younger generation of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, prompting Madonna to look for a more distinctive sound. It was then that she was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï through some common friends. Madonna instantly liked the pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and acid bass in his songs.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying}} to expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and stop worrying about getting played [...] and just make a good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E
