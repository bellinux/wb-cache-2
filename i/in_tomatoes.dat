5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin <b>in</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly <b>in</b> <b>tomatoes</b> and other crops.|$|E

40|$|The avrPto gene of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato {{triggers}} {{race-specific resistance}} <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> plants carrying Pto, a resistance gene encoding a protein kinase. When introduced into P. s. tabaci, avrPto triggers resistance in tobacco W 38 plants that carry the corresponding R gene. The AvrPto protein {{is believed to}} be secreted into host cells through the bacterial type III secretion pathway, where it activates disease resistance <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> by interacting with Pto. We report here the identification of two distinct regions in AvrPto that determine the recognition specificity of this protein <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> and tobacco. Point mutations in the central region disrupted the avirulence activity <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> but not <b>in</b> tobacco. Conversely, point mutations in the C-terminal region abolished the avirulence in tobacco but not <b>in</b> <b>tomato.</b> We further report that AvrPto was localized to the plasma membrane of plant cells. Disrupting the membrane association by mutating a putative myristoylation motif of AvrPto abolished the avirulence activity <b>in</b> both <b>tomato</b> and tobacco. These findings demonstrate that AvrPto is recognized differently by the R genes <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> and tobacco and that the recognition of AvrPto probably is associated with the plasma membrane...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{salicylic}} acid (SA) {{was investigated in}} basal defence and induced resistance to powdery mildew (Oidium neolycopersici) and grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> (Lycopersicon esculentum) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). A comparison of NahG transgenic tomato and tobacco (unable to accumulate SA) to their respective wild types revealed that <b>in</b> <b>tomato,</b> SA {{was not involved in}} basal defence against O. neolycopersici but NahG tobacco showed an enhanced susceptibility to O. neolycopersici infection, the effect becoming more obvious as the plants grew older. In contrast, SA played no role in the basal defence of tobacco against B. cinerea, but seemed to contribute to basal defence of tomato against B. cinerea. Activation of the SA-dependent defence pathway via benzothiadiazole (BTH) resulted in induced resistance against O. neolycopersici in tobacco but not <b>in</b> <b>tomato.</b> Microscopic analysis revealed that BTH treatment could prevent penetration of the Oidium germ tube through tobacco leaves, whereas penetration was successful on tomato leaves irrespective of BTH treatment. In contrast, soil or leaf treatment with BTH induced resistance against B. cinerea <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> but not <b>in</b> tobacco.

Residues of 2 -allylphenol were extracted from tomato matrix with acetone, purified by liquid-liquid extraction and Florisil cartrieges, and then determined by HPLC with UV-detector. The minimum detectable amount of 2 -allylphenol was 3 x 10 (- 9) g, the minimum detectable concentration of 2 -allylphenol in the samples of tomato were 0. 01 mg/kg. The ranges of average recoveries and coefficient variation of the method were 87. 7 %- 90. 2 % and 1. 25 %- 2. 06 %, respectively.

40|$|Main conclusion: The {{transcripts}} of transgenic prosystemin (PS) gene are mobile and the PS mRNA {{can be translated}} into protein <b>in</b> <b>tomato</b> and tobacco plants. Systemin (SYS) and its precursor protein, prosystemin (PS), are upstream components of the wound-induced signaling pathway <b>in</b> <b>tomato.</b> Although the mobile signal(s) for wound responses {{has been the subject}} of considerable research, its identity remains controversial. Intensive studies have revealed the essential role of mRNA on plant systemic signaling. We hypothesize that PS mRNA can act as a transmissible signal <b>in</b> <b>tomato.</b> Herein, we demonstrated that transgenic PS mRNA occurs in leaves located at considerable distances from the initial site of its generation by a transient Agrobacterium-infiltration assay system. We also showed that PS protein is present in the vascular bundle of the distant leaves.
