50|$|Radial shaft seals, {{also known}} as lip seals, are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem seals. Early radial shaft seals utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> which helps the sealing lip compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> is a coiled steel {{spring that}} is {{connected}} {{at each end}} to create a circular shape, and is used in oil seals, shaft seals, belt-driven motors, and electrical connectors. Compression garter springs exert outward radial forces, while extension garter springs exert inward radial forces. The manufacturing process is {{not much different from}} the creation of regular coiled springs, with the addition of joining the ends together. Like most other springs, garter springs are typically manufactured with either carbon steel or stainless steel wire.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} {{tool assembly}} is run on an appropriate running tool {{complete with a}} running prong. The running prong {{is connected to the}} top of the internal seal prong with a shear pin, and the running tool is attached to the lock in the normal manner. After locating the sliding sleeve, the operator jars downward to set the lock, then pulls upward to close the isolation plug in the separation tool. As this happens, a <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> in the isolation plug moves a steel shear pin into a groove on the sealing prong, and an O-ring on the internal prong seals to isolate the tubing below the sliding sleeve. The running prong that is pinned {{to the top of the}} internal prong is then sheared, and the slickline toolstring may be withdrawn from the well.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> {{are used}} for oil seals and shaft seals. Since {{they are able to}} {{withstand}} forces from all directions, <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> are effective at handling changes in volume, pressure, temperature, and viscosity.|$|R
50|$|Extension <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> {{are on the}} {{opposite}} side of the spring spectrum. Although they are also a type of coiled <b>spring,</b> extension <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> exert inward radial forces that move toward the center. Extension springs store potential energy in their extended form and want to contract. Thinner wire and a greater number of coils allow extension springs to be able to contract quickly, which is essential when dealing with pressurized fluids and gases. Extension <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> act against forces from the center, so they may be placed on the outside of a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. They act similar to a bracelet, which is extended to fit around the hand and then snaps back into shape on the wrist. Extension <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> are more common than compression <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> because they use less material (smaller circumference and thinner wire) and they respond to changes quicker and more efficiently.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} main stages for the {{production}} of steel <b>garter</b> <b>springs.</b> The first step is to cut and coil reels of steel wire to produce normal coiled springs. The strength of the spring is proportional to the thickness of the wire. Compression springs are coiled {{in such a way that}} the coils are more spaced apart, while extension springs have no space between the coils. The second step is to join each end of the spring to form the <b>garter</b> <b>spring's</b> unique circular shape. This can be accomplished through a few different ways: ...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} circumferential {{segmented ring}} seal {{was designed for}} direct replacement of a helicopter transmission elastomeric lip seal operating on a shaft diameter of 13. 91 centimeters (5. 481 in.) at sliding velocities to 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min). The modifications involved the <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> tension, shaft roundness, seal housing flatness, and pumping grooves to inhibit leakage. Operation of the seals in bench tests under simulated helicopter transmission conditions revealed that the seal leakage rate was within acceptable limits and that the wear rate was negligible. The low leakage and wear rates were confirmed in flight tests of 600 and 175 hours (sliding speed, 48. 11 m/sec (9470 ft/min)). An additional 200 hours of air worthiness qualification testing (aircraft tie down) demonstrated that the seal can operate at the advanced sliding conditions of 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{tubes of}} pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) operate under high temperature high pressure aqueous environment and {{are subjected to}} fast neutron irradiation. In order to assure the structural integrity of pressure tube during service, it is periodically examined by non-destructive examination (NDE) techniques. A typical Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) consists of few hundred horizontally placed coolant channels. The coolant channel comprises of a Zr- 2. 5 % Nb pressure tube encircled by a Zircaloy- 4 calandria tube and four <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> spacers (Zr- 2. 5 Nb- 0. 5 Cu), which prevents these two tubes to come in contact during their service life. The pressure tube carries the nuclear fuel, high temperature high pressure heavy water coolant and is subjected to fast neutron irradiation. The integrity of pressure tube {{is central to the}} safety of PHWRs. To ensure this, they are periodically subjected to in-service inspection by nondestructive examination (NDE) techniques. In this paper detailed study has been done on the operating conditions which lead to degradations in the pressure tube with respect to dimensional changes as a result of irradiation creep and growth, deterioration in mechanical properties due to irradiation embitterment, initiation and growth of new flaws like fretting damage due to debris and fuel element bearing pads. The absorbed hydrogen can also limit the life of a pressure tube due to the degradation mechanisms such as delayed hydride cracking (DHC), hydride blister formation and cracking and hydride embitterment. It is...|$|E
40|$|Present day {{accelerator}} development requires {{new technologies}} for their diverse needs. Accelerator & Pulse Power Division of BARC {{is working on}} the development of ‘Electromagnetic Forming (EMF) technique ’ for various industrial applications. This technique utilizes the Lorentz force to achieve the required formation/movement of the job piece. The force is generated when a charged capacitor bank discharges through a forming/displacement coil placed in near proximity of the job piece. The force is developed on account of interaction of induced currents in the job piece with the magnetic field produced by the coil. The technology is a non-contact forming method and has variety of applications in the industry including the nuclear industry. It has distinct advantages like precision, repeatability, automation, no preparatory procedures, etc., over the conventional techniques. Energy storage capacitors are used as primary source of energy. The technique has been used for many of our in-house activities. It was successfully employed for <b>Garter</b> <b>Spring</b> repositioning in Pressurised Heavy Water reactors [1]. The technique stands as a viable alternative for the conventional methods of Fuel Pin fabrication of nuclear reactor. This project at present is in the development stage. Presently, the development of ‘Detachment of Rolled Joints ’ employing EMF implosion has been taken up for Advanced Heavy Water Reactor. This technique has tremendous potential in Accelerators, as well. Presently, we are working on an extremely important development of Metal-Ceramicjoints using EMF. Trials on 15 mm diameter, ceramic rods and 0. 4 mm thick copper tubes have qualified Helium leak rate of 10 - 10 Std cc/s and vacuum of 10 - 6 Torr. Further trials for improving the performance are being taken up. This paper highlights the salient features of EMF and suggests some specific areas where it could benefit the accelerator technology...|$|E
50|$|Compression <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> are {{a type of}} {{coiled spring}} that exerts outward radial forces away from the center. They are {{typically}} {{made up of a}} thick steel wire with large coils; compression springs {{need to be able to}} handle very large loads while being able to return to their natural extended position. Compression springs store potential energy when they are compressed (length of spring decreases), and exert kinetic energy when released. Compression <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> use this principle to withstand forces acting on it from outside. They may be placed inside a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. This is similar to squeezing a rubber ball; the ball will contract when squeezed but will return to its natural state once the external pressure is released.|$|R

5000|$|Carbon steel [...] wire is {{typically}} used for <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> {{due to its}} affordable price and usability, in comparison to stainless steel. Carbon steel springs tend to have very high yield strengths, {{and are able to}} return to their original shape when temporarily deformed. The carbon content in carbon steel wires range from 0.50 to 0.95 percent. This relatively small amount of carbon is enough to improve the toughness of the spring. The close proximity to oil and high-pressure engines mean heat treated <b>garter</b> <b>springs</b> are essential for enduring temperatures over 100°C (212°F). However, carbon steel is not suitable for highly corrosive environments; stainless steel would be a more viable option. Stainless steel differs from carbon steel in the amount of chromium present; stainless steel has between 10.5% to 11% chromium by mass, while carbon steel has about 1%.|$|R
40|$|Packer {{elements}} are traditionally rubber seals that can operate under specified downhole conditions {{and provide a}} seal for either a short-term, retrievable, or a long-term, permanent, completion. In this case a retrievable 19. 7 cm (7 - 3 / 4 ") packer element for a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) environment was designed and tested. The element created a seal between the mandrel, or tubing, and the casing. At high temperature and pressure rubber needs to be contained {{so that it will}} create and maintain an energized seal. In this study only Aflas rubber was tested. Various backup systems were examined; some more traditional designs such as the carbon steel foldback ring were compared to more experimental ideas. Results of theoretical simulations were compared to actual test results in order to gain a greater understanding of element behavior. Experiments were also performed to study the process of element setting, which is difficult to observe due to the high pressures and temperatures required. In a related study alternative materials to rubber such as annealed high-conductivity oxygen-free copper were tested to determine if the properties could be applied for packer element applications. The most successful design was the foldback ring with an anti-extrusion PEEK ring under the gage ring. This design passed a liquid test at 134 MPa (19. 5 k psi) differential pressure and a gas test at 87. 6 MPa (12. 7 k psi) differential pressure. New designs such as the split ring with mesh and the <b>garter</b> <b>spring</b> with mesh did not pass fixture tests but could be successful with further modifications. FEA was used as an analytical tool to create simulations of the element after a setting force is applied. The modeling was shown to correlate to the actual test results and therefore {{it would be a good}} tool to use in future studies. by Stephanie Berger. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|For nickel-containing alloys {{irradiated}} in thermalized neutron fluxes, {{the formation}} and reaction of 59 Ni with thermal neutrons can lead to time-varying changes in displacement damage rate, expressed as displacements per atom per second (dpa. s- 1), gas formation and nuclear heating. Ni-rich alloys are used in PWR and BWR reactors as spacers within fuel assemblies but also as tensioning springs for these same assemblies. Flux thimbles have also been made from Ni-rich alloys {{in the past but}} are gradually being replaced by thimbles made from other alloys containing substantially less Ni. In a CANDU reactor, Ni-alloys are used as tensioning springs, fuel channel spacers (in the form of <b>garter</b> <b>springs)</b> and as cable sheathing and core wires in flux-detector assemblies. Prediction of the irradiationprocesses that affect the functionality of these CANDU internals, such as irradiation embrittlement and irradiation creep, especially under conditions of extended operation, necessitates a consideration of the effect of the transmutation of Ni. Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable increase in the understanding of the effects of irradiation on the properties of components made from Ni-rich alloys. The nuclear processes and the effects of irradiation damage on the performance of components made from these alloys will be described...|$|R
40|$|The Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) {{are made}} from a {{cylindrical}} horizontal vessel, named calandria vessel, and is filled with heavy water which serves as moderator. The vessel is penetrated {{by a number of}} horizontally assemblies named fuel channels. Each fuel channel is made form two concentrically tubes: the interior one, named pressure tube, is the seat for nuclear fuel bundles and through them, heavy water circulates as coolant fluid, and the exterior one named calandria tube. The annular gap between the two tubes is filled with CO 2 or N 2 dried, under pressure and represents a thermal barrier between coolant fluids which is “hot ” and the moderator which is “cold”. The pressure tubes are made form Zr- 2. 5 %Nb, and have 103 mm inner diameter and 4. 2 mm wall thickness. The concentricity of the two tubes is assured by four <b>garter</b> <b>springs.</b> During the outage a series of pressure tubes, statistically selected, are nondestructive controlled [1]. Inside the examined pressure tube, a complex measuring head is inserted, allowing visual examination with video camera, ultrasound through different techniques and eddy current. The examination techniques should allow the detection of discontinuities appeared during exploitation, so on internal as well as on external surface of pressure tubes and their distinguishing from scratche...|$|R

5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern <b>garter</b> snake, and <b>spring</b> peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|R
