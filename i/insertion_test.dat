40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a new {{real-time}} disk scheduling algorithm called BFI (best-fit-insertion) is proposed. Notably, {{different from}} the conventional real-time problem, the service time of a disk request depends on its schedule result. As the service time is not a constant value, it is time-consuming to verify the feasi-bility of a schedule. In this paper, we introduce a temporal parameter called maximum tardiness. With the help of maximum tardiness, we can verify the im-provement of an <b>insertion</b> <b>test</b> within a constant time. We have evaluated and im-plemented our proposed algorithm on operating systems. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can support more requests and can achieve higher disk throughput {{than that of the}} conventional approach. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{commercial}} wedge hot-film probe is {{studied to}} determine its heat transfer response in transonic to low supersonic flows of high unit Reynolds number. The {{results of this study}} show that its response in this flow regime differs from the response of cylindrical type sensors. Whereas the cylindrical sensor has the same sensitivity to velocity as to density for free-stream Mach numbers exceeding 1. 3, the wedge probe sensitivity to velocity is always greater than its sensitivity to density over the entire flow regime. This property requires determination of three fluctuation components due to density, velocity, and temperature, in a transonic or supersonic turbulent flow. Sensitivity equations are derived based on the observed behavior of the wedge probe. Both the durability and the frequency response of the probe are excellent, the square wave <b>insertion</b> <b>test</b> indicating frequency response near 130 kHz.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and document the potential of applying ceramics in two specific drug delivery applications: tamper-resistant opioid formulations and transdermal enhancement protrusions. Geopolymers were developed into the matrix for a tamper-resistant formulation, aiming to protect drug substances from non-medical abuse. The synthesis conditions and excipients composition of the geopolymer-based formulation were modified in this work to facilitate a stable and extended drug delivery. Results showed that 37 ºC 100 % humidity for 48 hours were applicable conditions to obtain geopolymer with suitable mechanical strength and porosity. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the integration of poly(methyl acrylate) into the geopolymer-based formulation could reduce the drug release at low pH and, meanwhile, maintain the mechanical strength. Therefore, the geopolymer-based drug formulations concluded from these studies were applied in oral and transdermal delivery systems. Evidence of the tamper-resistance of geopolymer-based oral and transdermal formulations was documented and compared to the corresponding commercial opioid formulations. The results provided experimental support for the positive effects of geopolymers as drug carriers for the tamper-resistance of oral and transdermal delivery systems. Self-setting bioceramics, calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate were fabricated into transdermal enhancement protrusions in this work for the first time. Results showed that, under mild conditions, both bioceramics could form pyramid-shaped needles in the micron size. The drug release from these needles could be controlled by the bulk surface area, porosity and degradation of the bioceramics. An in vitro <b>insertion</b> <b>test</b> showed that the bioceramic microneedles had enough mechanical strength to insert into skin. Further optimization on the geometry of needles and the substrate material was also performed. The higher aspect-ratio needles with a flexible and self-swellable substrate could release most of the drug content within 4 hours and could penetrate through the stratum corneum by manual insertion. This study explored the potential application of bioceramics in transdermal enhancement protrusions and showed promising indication of their future developments...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy {{involves}} {{delivery of}} a photosensitising drug that is activated by light of a specific wavelength, resulting in generation of highly reactive radicals. This activated species can cause destruction of targeted cells. Application of this process for treatment of microbial infections has been termed “photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy” (PACT). In the treatment of chronic wounds, the delivery of photosensitising agents is often impeded {{by the presence of}} a thick hyperkeratotic/necrotic tissue layer, reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Microneedles (MNs) are an emerging drug delivery technology that have been demonstrated to successfully penetrate the outer layers of the skin, whilst minimising damage to skin barrier function. Delivering photosensitising drugs using this platform has been demonstrated to have several advantages over conventional photodynamic therapy, such as, painless application, reduced erythema, enhanced cosmetic results and improved intradermal delivery. The aim {{of this study was to}} physically characterise dissolving MNs loaded with the photosensitising agent, methylene blue and assess their photodynamic antimicrobial activity. Dissolving MNs were fabricated from aqueous blends of Gantrez® AN- 139 co-polymer containing varying loadings of methylene blue. A height reduction of 29. 8 % was observed for MNs prepared from blends containing 0. 5 % w/w methylene blue following application of a total force of 70. 56 N/array. A previously validated <b>insertion</b> <b>test</b> was used to assess the effect of drug loading on MN insertion into a wound model.

Microbial susceptibility to PACT was determined by assessing the total viable count. Kill rates of > 96 %, were achieved for S. aureus and > 99 % for E. coli and C. albicans with the combination of PACT and methylene blue concentrations between 0. 1 and 2. 5 mg/mL.

In our institute, we used combo modality as HRCT and high-field MRI rather to use single modality for complete workup {{and for the}} selection of proper size electrode array. The aim {{of the study is}} to correlate the cochlear dimensions using CT/MRI with- (1) Intraoperative surgical findings/difficulties. (2) Preoperative electrode array option selection. MATERIALS AND METHODS MDCT and 1. 5 Tesla MRI machine was used to scan the patients. Patients screened and operated at B. J. Medical College and Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. 30 patients were taken within period of 2 years from March 2009 to April 2011. All the patients underwent CT and MRI study. Cochlear implant (MED-EL, Austria) was used for this study. Each scan was obtained on a 16 -section spiral CT (GE, bright speed). The studies were performed with the following parameters- 0. 75 -mm collimation, 0. 625 -mm section thickness, 140 kVp, 120 mAs, pitch of 0. 8, a 15 -cm field of view and a 512 x 512 matrix. The initial data sets were then reconstructed at 0. 1 mm intervals. All 15 patients also underwent MRI (GE Signa HDx 1. 5 T series) examination for internal auditory canal in whom FIESTA sequence was taken with flip angle 65 degrees, slice thickness 0. 8 mm, matrix 256 x 320. RESULTS Thirty cases were taken for the study. Twenty patients were completely suitable for standard electrode. Six patients needed the use of <b>insertion</b> <b>test</b> device before the actual insertion of active electrode. In 3 patients, split electrode was kept as backup implant, but was finally not needed. One patient had common cavity cochlea who refused surgery because of variable outcome. Three patients had high jugular bulb. Six patients had rotated cochlea. One patient had dehiscent facial nerve at 2 nd genu. CONCLUSION Multidetector volumetric CT scanner with 3 D reconstruction and higher strength MRI provide soft tissue and bony detail with very high resolution for cochlea and also helps in minimise the intraoperative difficulties and overcoming it and also help in assessing the involvement of adjacent critical structures like internal carotid artery, jugular bulb and facial nerve. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of an electrically active microneedle array that can deliver biomolecules such as DNA and drugs to epidermal cells by means of electroporation. Properly metallized microneedles could serve as microelectrodes essential for electroporation. Furthermore, the close needle-to-needle spacing of microneedle electrodes provides the advantage of utilizing reduced voltage, which is essential for safety as well as portable applications, while maintaining the large electric fields required for electroporation. Therefore, microneedle arrays can potentially be used as part of a minimally invasive, highly-localized electroporation system for cells in the epidermis layer of the skin. This research consists of three parts: development of the 3 -D microfabrication technology to create the microneedle array, fabrication and characterization of the microneedle array, and the electroporation studies performed with the microneedle array. A 3 -D fabrication process was developed to produce a microneedle array using an inclined UV exposure technique combined with micromolding technology, potentially enabling low cost mass-manufacture. The developed technology is also capable of fabricating 3 -D microstructures of various heights using a single mask. The fabricated microneedle array was then tested to demonstrate its feasibility for through-skin electrical and mechanical functionality using a skin <b>insertion</b> <b>test.</b> It was found that the microneedles were able to penetrate skin without breakage. To study the electrical properties of the array, a finite element simulation was performed to examine the electric field distribution. From these simulation results, a predictive model was constructed to estimate the effective volume for electroporation. Finally, studies to determine hemoglobin release from bovine red blood cells (RBC) and the delivery of molecules such as calcein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) into human prostate cancer cells were used to verify the electrical functionality of this device. This work established that this device can be used to lyse RBC and to deliver molecules, e. g. calcein, into cells, thus supporting our contention that this metallized microneedle array can be used to perform electroporation at reduced voltage. Further studies to show efficacy in skin should now be performed. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Mark G. Allen; Committee Member: Mark R.

The duty of educators is to be aware of the significance of physical activity on the child’s overall development process and health, as well as to raise awareness of the more and more common problem amongst children – physical inactivity. Due to development of technology, the public has become more static and therefore increasingly inactive, which is why it is everyone’s task to motivate children to engage in physical activities, which are suited to their abilities, correctly structured and easily accessible to the child. The effects of living an active childhood develop physical abilities as well as overall development, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and establishing a positive self-image. There is a high probability that a physically active adolescent will make the transition into a physically active adult. The aim of this master’s degree is to analyze physical abilities of children between the ages of 6 to 9 and compare them by gender, quantity and intensity of physical activity. In order to collect the data, we monitored children’s results in various activities, such as standing broad jump, cube insertion, backward polygon, Flamingo test, hand clapping and 300 meters run. A Research has been carried out on 951 children, who have had their physical abilities analyzed. On the subsample of 56 participants we have also measured the quantity and intensity of physical activity with the help of an accelerometer. We decided to go with the advanced approach, using an accelerometer, in order to get a more accurate perspective on the topic than if we were to use the obsolete, self-assessing methods, used in the past. We have checked the data using set hypotheses, which were processed with OriginPro 8 and Microsoft Excel 2010 and verified using a t-test and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. We have determined that the quantity of physical activity does not ascend as children become older. Apart from the high intensity physical activities, there have been no instances of distinctions in results between genders. Boys tend to rank higher on the physical fitness tests, with the exception of cube <b>insertion</b> <b>test.</b> The results have also shown that boys in all age groups do not pursue medium to high intensity physical activities for longer periods of time. The intensity of physical activity does not decline with the increase in children’s age.

Inclined rotational UV exposure using SU- 8 {{has been exploited}} to simultaneously generate gradually varying 3 -D structures with different heights in a single mask. For 3 -D metal patterning, a metal transfer micromolding process has been utilized, where pre-patterned metal electrodes are formed on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold prior to transfer, and these patterned metal structures are transferred to the molded 3 -D microstructures during the micromolding process.

40|$|Conservation {{is often}} used to define {{essential}} sequences within RNA sites. However, conservation finds only invariant sequence elements that are necessary for function, rather than finding a set of sequence elements sufficient for function. Biochemical studies in several systems—including the hammerhead ribozyme and the purine riboswitch—find additional elements, such as loop–loop interactions, required for function yet not phylogenetically conserved. Here we define a critical test of sufficiency: We embed a minimal, apparently sufficient motif for binding the amino acid tryptophan in a random-sequence background and ask whether we obtain functional molecules. After a negative result, we use a combination of three-dimensional structural modeling, selection, designed mutations, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics to explore functional insufficiency. This reveals an essential unpaired G in a diverse structural context, varied sequence, and flexible distance from the invariant internal loop binding site identified previously. Addition of the new element yields a sufficient binding site by the insertion criterion, binding tryptophan in 22 out of 23 tries.

For instance, this value may be set equal to the system's excess energy per particle, in such way that the inserted particles are energetically indistinguishable from the other particles present. During {{the search for the}} insertion site, the USHER algorithm uses a steepest descent iterator with a displacement whose magnitude is adapted to the local features of the energy landscape.

The goals of this project are to quantify the sound attenuation properties of fiberglass duct liner and to perform a regression analysis to develop equations to predict insertion loss values for both rectangular and round duct liners. The first goal was accomplished via <b>insertion</b> loss <b>testing.</b> The tests performed conformed to the ASTM E 477 standard. Using the <b>insertion</b> loss <b>test</b> data, regression equations were developed to predict insertion loss values for rectangular ducts ranging in size from 12 -in x 18 -in to 48 -in x 48 -in in lengths ranging from 3 ft to 30 ft. Regression equations were also developed to predict insertion loss values for round ducts ranging in diameters from 12 -in to 48 -in in lengths ranging from 3 ft to 30 ft...|$|R
