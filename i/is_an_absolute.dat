5|$|Saudi Arabia <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> monarchy, {{and has no}} {{legally binding}} written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. The Basic Law {{outlines}} the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the Fahrenheit {{scale is}} widely used. On this scale the {{freezing}} point of water corresponds to 32°F and {{the boiling point}} to 212°F.

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> {{limit on}} an individual's speed of walking (without special {{techniques}} such as those employed in speed walking) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride – if it's greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground. Typically however, animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} {{and evaluation of}} art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby {{it is also an}} absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.|$|E
25|$|Absolute or {{anhydrous}} alcohol refers to ethanol {{with a low}} water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, even granted the above, {{it does not}} follow that {{identity}} theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word [...] "green" [...] contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter e along with one each of the others.|$|E
500|$|Bleacher Reports' Andrew Nuschler observed: [...] "Maddon {{spent his}} tenure as the AL All Star manager finding new and inventive ways to give Ian Kinsler the middle finger." [...] And Sports Illustrateds Jacob Osterhout took note, writing: It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> travesty that Ian Kinsler is not the {{starting}} second baseman for the American League. Dustin Pedroia, who IS the starting second baseman, has hit only three home runs and has 36 RBIs. Kinsler, on the other hand, has hit 20 home runs and has 63 RBIs. The fact that Kinsler isn't even a reserve {{makes it hard to}} take the All Star Game seriously.|$|E

500|$|Another way to {{interpret}} the clause is {{through the lens of}} textualism, that is, giving primary consideration to what the law says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem. Because to textualism believers the language of the rule <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a [...] "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls." [...] Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's [...] "spirit" [...] overrides its text.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{a positive response}} from critics. Sommer Swindell of the Observer-Reporter commented that [...] "after listening to [...] once, no one will forget 'Deep, Deep Trouble' [...] It would be hard not to crack a smile while listening closely to the lyrics, as they are very creative and humorous." [...] Thor Christensen of The Milwaukee Journal wrote that Bart [...] "gets in a few good yuks" [...] in the song, and Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune reported that Bart [...] "raps out an amusing story about his misadventures while mowing the lawn". The Orange County Registers Cary Darling noted that [...] "Bart turning his life into a hip-hop autobiography on 'Deep, Deep Trouble' <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> joy." [...] Cartwright's rapping was praised by Tom Hopkins of the Dayton Daily News.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church [...] {{states that}} the death penalty is {{permissible}} in cases of extreme gravity. It is allowed if the [...] "guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined" [...] and if the death penalty {{is the only way to}} defend others against the guilty party. However, if there are other means available to defend people from the [...] "unjust aggressor", these are preferred because they are considered to be more respectful of the dignity of the person and in keeping with the common good. Because modern societies have effective means for preventing crime without execution, the Catechism declares, [...] "the cases in which execution of the offender <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> necessity 'are very rare, if practically nonexistent. Pope John Paul II discussed and affirmed this in Evangelium Vitae, published in 1995.|$|E
