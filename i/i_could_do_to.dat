500|$|Biggs {{played in}} two more internationals for Wales, {{both in the}} 1894 Championship and both {{resulted}} in losses. The {{first game of the}} 1894 Championship was against England, and Wales suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24–3. In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded [...] "Tackle him? It was as much as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get out of his way!". In his final game against Ireland, Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three-quarters, along with Tom Pearson, Dai Fitzgerald and Jack Elliott. The very next international saw Biggs' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time, the brothers missing each other by just one match.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{trained as}} a {{navigator}} and bomb aimer, before serving with No. 13 Squadron RAAF, based mainly on the Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory, flying Lockheed Ventura bombers. He reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant. While in the service, he began his political activities, distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging {{the passage of the}} [...] "Fourteen Powers" [...] referendum of 1944, which would have expanded the powers of the federal government. [...] Although the party was victorious, the referendum it advocated was defeated. In 1961, Whitlam said of the referendum defeat, [...] "My hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment I determined to do all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> modernise the Australian Constitution." [...] While still in uniform, Whitlam joined the ALP in Sydney in 1945. He was discharged from the RAAF on 17 October 1945, and continued to use Air Force log books to record all of the flights he took until 2007. Whitlam completed his studies after the war, obtained his Bachelor of Laws, and was admitted to the federal and New South Wales bars in 1947.|$|E
500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left right now is my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E
60|$|And before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> prevent it, the shopman had clapped the big drum over him.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> much <b>to</b> {{help him}} he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck me}} {{that the best thing}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> shake hands with the wrathful foreman, and I did it very heartily.|$|R
2500|$|During {{talks with}} Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the {{negotiations}} set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that [...] "I could {{walk in and}} take the whole lot this afternoon", to which she replied that [...] "there is nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stop you, but {{the eyes of the}} world would now know what China is like".|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{had been}} asked to become honorary {{director}} of a prospective Royal Hibernian General Railroad Company but as he wrote to Lord Grey on 20 January 1825: [...] "...my answer has been that whatever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent the establishment of such a company, I would do—think of placing at the mercy of a set of London capitalists all the landed property of Ireland. ... traffickers in money—a very useful class, I grant—but are we quite sure, that setting afloat such projects, putting them in newspapers, may not be converted into swindling means?" ...|$|E
2500|$|McCloy [...] "became very {{dizzy and}} lightheaded. Some drifted off into what {{appeared}} to be a deep sleep, and one person sitting near me collapsed and fell off his bucket, not moving. It was clear that there was nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help him. The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God’s will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else. I have no idea how much time went by before I also passed out from the gas and smoke, awaiting rescue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I--came {{to see if}} you rested well," [...] {{answered}} the old man; [...] "and--if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>to</b> serve you, on any consideration." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Sweet Guy" [...] was {{directed}} by Claudia Castle, who had earlier directed Kelly's [...] "To Her Door", which won 'Best Video' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1988. The video is shot {{in black and white}} and switches between Kelly and his band, and a couple fighting and making up. Kelly later wrote that he was disappointed in the video, [...] "this one looked like an ad for coffee or sheets... had worked with us on a couple of videos previously ... that had turned out really well. We'd talked this one through and made a plan ... but when I saw the rough cut my heart sank. And there wasn't much <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> change it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks {{as if we}} were snowed in {{good and}} proper," [...] {{returned}} another man. [...] "I wanted to get to one of those stores across the way, and I had about all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make it. In one place I got into snow up to my waist, and it was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|I muttered {{something}} about being an outsider--wondered {{if there was anything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help.|$|E
6000|$|... "The others {{told me you}} had a headache. I'm {{very sorry}} to hear that. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> make you feel better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see." [...] The {{former teacher}} of Oak Hall gritted his teeth. [...] "Oh, how <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> punish Porter and those others!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} you again, Ronald, before {{they take you}} south. I would that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more <b>to</b> help you besides just coming to see you." ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded my head again. It was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (willing {{to embrace}} her). I wish, Tweeny, there was {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make you happy also.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} that she had gone out, and begged leave to try what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> supply her place.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, {{and it was all}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> not <b>to</b> break the magician's commands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} can say {{anything}} you choose to me," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> show you how grateful I am to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the only}} way in which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> justice <b>to</b> his memory," [...] she said, simply. [...] "I hope you don't object to my going on the stage?" ...|$|R
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; {{and it was all}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep from crying.|$|E
60|$|My {{heart was}} thudding with the guns, {{and it was}} all that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> answer her for the catch of my breath.|$|E
60|$|It was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep a {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good}} idea where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{on their}} way out West, and I suppose they ran up here to see the sights. I--I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> 'em!" [...] added Nat, bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|... (Shaking {{hands with}} Knox.) Forgive me, but I {{had to see}} you. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not get you on the telephone. I called and called, and the best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> get the wrong number.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> {{help you}} to the year at C---—. Mother has always said that she will {{let me try to}} publish 'Hart's- tongue Well' when I am twenty-one!" ...|$|R

60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E

60|$|I {{felt the}} only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> ask her to marry me. And when I saw the joy that came into her poor, tear-stained face I knew I'd done the right thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did what}} I could," [...] Karl growled, [...] "but {{it was not}} much. The colonel has always looked well after me, and the least <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> look after him, when he wanted it.|$|R
6000|$|... "So all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> {{go back to}} {{the other}} room, and tell him that I wanted her to go to sleep, and that he must not call out to her until I told him.|$|R
