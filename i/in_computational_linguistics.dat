25|$|Within lexical semantics, {{especially}} {{as applied to}} computers, modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is {{understood in terms of}} related words; semantic networks are therefore important <b>in</b> <b>computational</b> <b>linguistics.</b> Still, other methods in phonology (e.g. optimality theory, which uses lattice graphs) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using finite-state transducers) are common in the analysis of language as a graph. Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as , as well as various 'Net' projects, such as WordNet, VerbNet, and others.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue when}} using n-gram {{language}} models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered <b>in</b> <b>computational</b> <b>linguistics</b> and {{natural language processing}} when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, {{it may be necessary}} to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over all the words in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.|$|E

2500|$|However, Sproat {{claimed that}} there existed {{a number of}} misunderstandings in Rao et al., {{including}} a lack of discriminative power in their model, and argued that applying their model to known non-linguistic systems such as Mesopotamian deity symbols produced similar results to the Indus script. [...] Rao et al.'s argument against Sproat's claims, and Sproat's reply, were published <b>in</b> <b>Computational</b> <b>Linguistics</b> in December 2010. The June 2014 issue of Language carries a paper by Sproat that provides further evidence that the methodology of Rao et al. is flawed.

2500|$|While {{the study}} of {{necessity}} and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include deontic logic and epistemic logic. [...] The seminal work of Arthur Prior applied the same formal language to treat temporal logic and {{paved the way for}} the marriage of the two subjects. Saul Kripke discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of frame semantics, which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new graph-theoretic way of looking at modality that has driven many applications <b>in</b> <b>computational</b> <b>linguistics</b> and computer science, such as dynamic logic.|$|E
