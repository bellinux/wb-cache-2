25|$|DNA {{methylation}} marks, are genomic {{regions with}} specific methylation pattern {{in a specific}} biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks {{are associated with the}} cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> of cell type-specific hypomethylation.|$|E

2500|$|Under Deng, {{the concept}} was further expanded. Believing that purer {{communist}} concepts such as class struggle and the like could not bring people together as they had done under Mao, his regime gave patriotism a larger role. In early 1982, the CPC initiated the [...] "Three Loves" [...] campaign under the slogan [...] "Love the party, love socialism, and love the motherland". A year later, the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Research Office formulated a comprehensive plan to exploit nationalist feelings by making films and television programs out of China's [...] "heroic struggle against Western and Japanese imperialism". [...] "Patriotic activities" [...] {{were added to the}} school system's extracurricular activities; the national flag was to be raised daily and pupils were to sing and learn the national anthem. By 1983, the party had concluded that [...] "among patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and communism, patriotism has peculiar <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions.</b> [...] Patriotism is the banner of greatest appeal." [...] Despite its broadened role, patriotism remained secondary to socialism. As Deng put it, [...] "Some have said that not loving Socialism {{is not the same as}} not loving one's motherland. Is the motherland something abstract? If you do not love socialist New China led by the Communist Party, what motherland do you love?" [...] According to official pronouncements, the CPC was the best representative of the nation, communists were the most devoted patriots, and socialism the only viable road for China to become [...] "a great nation". Deng Liqun, in a similar vein, said, [...] "One cannot demonstrate that one loves the motherland if one shows no deep love for the socialist system and the Communist Party. In short, in our times, loving the Chinese Communist Party is the highest expression of Chinese patriotism." ...|$|E

40|$|Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 {{is a model}} {{organism}} used {{to study}} the circadian rhythm, {{a process that is}} driven by an endogenous biological clock that can be modulated by external cues such as light and temperature. Some proteins have been identified that are involved in circadian signal transduction in S. elongatus. Of them, KaiA, KaiB and KaiC comprise the central oscillator components, which are essential for internal timekeeping. SasA is an important protein in the output pathway, which passes the information from central oscillator to downstream components, and thus controls metabolic and behavioral processes. CikA is a major component in the input pathway, which maintains synchrony of the oscillator with the environment. CikA is an unusual phytochrome-like histidine protein kinase. It has a pseudo receiver domain which can not accept a phosphoryl group. CikA is thought to be located at the poles of the cell through interaction between PsR and some protein or protein complex that is also localized at the poles. One of the potential CikA-interacting proteins identified through a yeast two hybrid screen is called hypothetical protein 1. It specifically recognizes a PsR bait in a yeast two hybrid assay. A bioinformatics analysis showed that there are predicted signal peptide and transmembrane domains at the N-terminal and a cytochrome C homolog domain at the C-terminal of Hyp 1. Elucidating the <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of Hyp 1 will provide us with useful information to understand the <b>function</b> <b>and</b> working mechanism of CikA, and therefore will help us to clarify the signal transduction in the clock. In this research, I used genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to study the <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of this newly identified clock component Hyp 1. To confirm the interaction between PsR and Hyp 1 and complement the yeast two hybrid data, I truncated Hyp 1 (Thyp 1) and purified soluble Thyp 1. At the same time, I obtained purified PsR. I tried to copurify the PsR and 6 -histidine-tagged Hyp 1 on a nickel affinity column. However, PsR non-specifically bound to the column, which eliminated the utility of this approach to study their interaction. In addition to using a biochemical approach to study Hyp 1, I constructed three hyp 1 overexpression alleles for genetic analysis and two hyp 1 -yfp overexpression fusion alleles for subcellular localization studies. All of them will help us to understand the <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of Hyp 1...|$|R
