5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute final {{cut of the}} film in July 1939. Jay hated it and demanded that Renoir make cuts, including the <b>excision</b> <b>of</b> Renoir's entire performance as Octave. Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 minutes from the film.|$|E
5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete <b>excision</b> <b>of</b> exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
5|$|Surgical <b>excision</b> <b>of</b> aphthous ulcers {{has been}} described, {{but it is}} an {{ineffective}} and inappropriate treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above, there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness, ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments, including aloe vera, myrtus communis, Rosa damascena, potassium alum, zinc sulfate, nicotine, polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin E2.|$|E

The significance of the reaction in foreseeing the prognosis was conjectured simultaneously. After subcutaneous transplantations, the reaction became positive within 3 days, while Shichijo's and Botelho's reaction did not, even within 9 days. On the other hand, the wave-heights of the reaction began to fall in the second week after <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> the subcutaneous tumors.

40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} with lesions of upper eyelids {{were treated with}} simple surgical excision under local anaesthesia as day cases. Three other {{patients with}} eyelid injuries had full-thickness margin-inclusive lacerations of upper eyelids. In all these 29 patients the upper eyelid wounds were allowed to heal solely by spontaneous repair. The cautious study began with small extramarginal skin excisions and progressed gradually via moderate sized juxtamarginal <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> skin and orbicularis lamella to full-thickness margin-inclusive excisions. The wounds healed satisfactorily in all the 29 patients without ocular or palpebral complications. The functional results were normal. Cosmetic results were excellent in 27 patients and acceptable in 2, one of whom subsequently underwent a secondary oculoplastic repair. This study demonstrates that, for upper eyelids, full-thickness margin-inclusive <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> up to 10 mm in horizontal extent and 5 - 6 mm in height, and moderate sized 13 X 10 mm juxtamarginal <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> the skin and orbicularis lamella, yield near normal results with solely spontaneous repair. Immediate surgical reconstruction of such wounds {{is assumed to be}} mandatory by current tenets of oculoplastic surgery...|$|R

25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy - that is, surgical <b>excision</b> <b>of</b> the entire testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord).

25|$|Confirmation of the {{clinical}} diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider <b>excision</b> <b>of</b> the scar or tumor.

Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.|$|E
40|$|In general {{practice}} 15 - 18 per 1000 patients per year present themselves {{with questions about}} a skin lesion or a pigmented spot on the skin. The general practitioner can choose to remove the lesion himself or send the patient to the hospital. Over {{the past few years}} the interest in skin lesions has risen. In January 2006 a new contract called the Vogelaarakkoord was introduced in the Netherlands. It planned {{to increase the amount of}} small surgical procedures in {{general practice}} by increasing the financial reward received for a small surgical procedure. This study looked at the changes in the number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> skin lesions send by GP’s to a large pathological laboratory in the north of the Netherlands during 2004 - 2009. The possible influence of the Vogelaarakkoord on the number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> was judged. Also calculated was the diagnostic accuracy of a GP and the percentage of unexpected (pre-) malignancies. And whether GP’s who performed a lot <b>of</b> skin <b>excisions</b> had a significant better diagnostic accuracy than the GP’s who didn’t. The data was gathered from PALGA, which registers all <b>excisions</b> <b>of</b> skin lesions send in to the Martini Ziekenhuis by GP’s in the north of the Netherlands. The number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> sent in rose from 3568 in 2004 to 6341 in 2009. In 2007 the number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> increased with 24. 5 %, this is believed to be a late effect of the Vogelaarakkoord. The number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> each GP performed per year rose significantly in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Diagnostic accuracy varied between 38. 8 % and 44. 4 %. None of the changes seen here were significant. The diagnostic accuracy of much excising GP’s was comparable to their colleagues. 3. 2 % to 5. 4 % of the excised skin lesions which were clinically diagnosed as benign were in fact pathologically (pre-) malignant. So the number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> has risen steadily since 2004, just as the number <b>of</b> <b>excisions</b> performed by each GP alone. The Vogelaarakkoord caused a rise in the number <b>of</b> sent in <b>excisions</b> in 2007. Diagnostic accuracy didn’t change significantly during the study period...|$|R

25|$|The {{objective}} in the surgical management of aortic dissection is to resect (remove) the most severely damaged {{segments of the}} aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and any secondary tears along the vessel).

25|$|Insertions add {{one or more}} extra {{nucleotides}} {{into the}} DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mRNA (splice site mutation), or cause {{a shift in the}} reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product.

The magazine's editor feared {{the story was}} indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality.
