For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a <b>given</b> <b>situation</b> statistically favors a certain batter, {{the manager of the}} fielding team {{may be more likely to}} change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly's kernel is a hybrid, {{containing}} {{features of}} both monolithic and microkernels, {{such as the}} message passing capability of microkernels enabling larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for certain critical tasks. The messaging subsystem being developed is {{similar to those found}} in microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly's messaging subsystem has the ability to act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any <b>given</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any <b>given</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E

5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a <b>given</b> <b>situation.</b> One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any <b>given</b> <b>situation,</b> teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

Oral DCT is the typical instrument used in pragmatics and was originally developed for comparing the speech act realization patterns of native speakers and learners (Blum-Kulka, 1982). Each of the eight controlled scenarios in the Oral DCT used in this study varies according to power and social distance. The results of this research show: first, that the subjects utilized certain strategies which contained politeness values. Some of the nine strategies were found in their requests. The students exhibited their preference for the use of Query Preparatory that falls under conventionally indirect request to depict politeness and to avoid imposition of requests. Second, both the Indonesian and Libyan students mostly used query preparatory strategy. The strategy of query preparatory was used fourty-three times in the study more than other request strategies, followed by direct and non conventional indirect request strategies. Query preparatory is one of the request strategies identified by the Cross-Cultural Speech Act Research Project (CCSARP) (Blum-Kulka, House, & Kasper, 1989) ...|$|R

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members {{may not have a}} common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a <b>given</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
25|$|When it is dark, {{they use}} {{echolocation}} calls to forage. During daylight hours, they {{can rely on}} vision to look for prey and intruders. The echolocation in T. mauritianus is unique in that their frequency pulses are emitted in patterns of twos and threes separated by long intervals of silence. This helps observers distinguish the species from other kinds of bats. The bats can adjust the frequency they emit to fit a <b>given</b> <b>situation.</b> For example, the bat can decrease the frequency to less than 20 Hertz to hunt insects that are attuned to bat echolocation, which gives them an advantage and increases their number of potential food sources. They are capable of emitting frequencies more than 25 Hertz, which allows them to hunt in less open habitats. This increases their range of habitats, and allows them to be flexible in their choice of environments.|$|E
