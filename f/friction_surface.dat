5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high <b>friction,</b> <b>surface</b> behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E
25|$|New {{models are}} {{beginning}} to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road <b>friction.</b> <b>Surface</b> roughness and contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} rod is required when constructing a compass. This {{can be created}} by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low <b>friction</b> <b>surface</b> {{to allow it to}} freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.|$|E

The experimental {{results indicate that}} the varying content of zircon affects the friction performance as well as plays crucial role in the iron film formation on the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>friction</b> layers, formed during friction process, were carefully characterized using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction methods. The phenomenon of two different types of iron film formation (film I and film II) on the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> is proposed and their formation and destruction mechanism is described. Despite the compositions of both iron films being similar, film I is formed by steel wool itself and film II by the debris from either disc or steel wool.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{modification}} {{is essential}} for improving the service properties of components. Cladding {{is one of the}} most widely employed methods of <b>surface</b> modification. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> is a candidate process for depositing the corrosion resistant coatings. Being a solid state process, it offers several advantages over conventional fusion based surfacing process. The aim of this work is to identify the relationship between the input variables and the process response and develop the predictive models that can be used in the design of new <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> applications. In the current work, austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 was <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> on high strength low alloy steel substrate. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> parameters, such as mechtrode rotational speed, feed rate of substrate and axial force on mechtrode, play a major role in determining the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength of <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> coatings. <b>Friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> coating and base metal were tested for pitting corrosion by potentio-dynamic polarization technique. Coating microstructure was characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Coatings in the as deposited condition exhibited strain-induced martensite in austenitic matrix. Pitting resistance of surfaced coatings was found to be much lower than that of mechtrode material and superior to that of substrate. A central composite design with three factors (mechtrode rotational speed, substrate traverse speed, axial load on mechtrode) and five levels was chosen to minimize the number of experimental conditions. Response surface methodology was used to develop the model. In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop a mathematical model to predict the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength by incorporating the <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> process parameters...|$|R

25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a <b>friction</b> <b>surface</b> for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E

2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.

40|$|Two {{different}} aspects of the role of oxide wear debris in fretting wear are studied by allowing them to escape from the interface during sliding. This is accomplished by laser surface texturing that forms regular micro-pores topography on the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> which enables this escape.

Their presence in the interface protects the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> when the dominant wear mechanism is adhesive and harms the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> when this mechanism is abrasive.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> is an {{advanced}} process of great potential and an enhanced technology in surface modification. It {{is a solid}} state process, which allows deposition welding at temperatures below the melting range. The present study is on the coating of stain-less steel on Spheroidal Graphite Iron {{through the process of}} <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing.</b> This work explains the perfection obtained through various combination of the parameters used in <b>friction</b> <b>surfacing</b> namely traverse speed, rotational speed and the applied load. Series of test was performed on the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaced</b> work piece. Fine bonding has been accomplished between the selected materials out of the process done with variable combination of process parameters. Mechanical tests like bending test, micro-hardness test and corrosion test were conducted. Appreciable hardness values (200 HRC) have been obtained in micro-hardness test. Bend test performed on the surface revealed good strength and reliability of the bonding. The Corrosion test was conducted to find the suitability of these deposits for chemical pumps, pressure vessels and joints of dissimilar metals. The presence of pearlite and ferrite matrix in the microstructure exemplifies the strength of the bond. These results are expected to find great use for important applications in defence, aerospace, electrical, automobile and many other industrial sectors in the engineering fields...|$|R

Measurements of acoustic emission in manufacturing machines in production lines shows that different events such as, galling, tool wear, lubricating failure, different viscosity of lubricants, stick-slip, necking and cracking of the sheet metal can be separated in time- and frequency domain. Laboratory tests show that proportionality exists between the effective output of the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the measured effective output of the AE-sensor in drawing a sheet metal between flat dies. The measured acoustic emission has been influenced by the smoothness, lubricants, relative speeds between the <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the contact pressure between the surfaces, galling, changed geometry's of <b>friction</b> <b>surfaces</b> and different types of material in contact.

50|$|Because the ratchet {{can only}} stop {{backward}} motion at discrete points (i.e., at tooth boundaries), a ratchet does allow {{a limited amount}} of backward motion. This backward motion—which is limited to a maximum distance equal to the spacing between the teeth—is called backlash. In cases where backlash must be minimized, a smooth, toothless ratchet with a high <b>friction</b> <b>surface</b> such as rubber is sometimes used. The pawl bears against the surface at an angle so that any backward motion will cause the pawl to jam against the surface and thus prevent any further backward motion. Since the backward travel distance is primarily a function of the compressibility of the high <b>friction</b> <b>surface,</b> this mechanism can result in significantly reduced backlash.|$|E
