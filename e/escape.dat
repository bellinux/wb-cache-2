5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} to <b>escape</b> from the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for <b>escape</b> attempts was death by starvation; {{the families of}} successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to <b>escape,</b> the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E

5|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are <b>Escape</b> sections, which {{occur when}} the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of <b>escape.</b> These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different pre-determined positions in each room. To <b>escape,</b> the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects {{with each other to}} create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as baccarat and magic squares. An in-game calculator is provided for math-related problems, and the player can ask characters for hints if they find an <b>Escape</b> room too difficult. All <b>Escape</b> sections are self-contained, with all items required to solve the puzzles being available within that section; items are not carried over between <b>Escape</b> sections. After finishing an <b>Escape</b> section, it becomes available to replay from the game's main menu.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her <b>escape,</b> and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's <b>escape,</b> including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the <b>escape</b> plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her <b>escape,</b> and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her <b>escape.</b> A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her <b>escape</b> and then killed her.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>escape</b> {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other <b>escape</b> {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making <b>escape</b> attempts.|$|E

40|$|We {{partition}} {{the fast}} <b>escaping</b> set of a transcendental entire function into two subsets, the maximally fast <b>escaping</b> {{set and the}} non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> set. These sets are shown to have strong dynamical properties. We show that {{the intersection of the}} Julia set with the non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> set is never empty. The proof uses a new covering result for annuli, which is of wider interest. It was shown by Rippon and Stallard that the fast <b>escaping</b> set has no bounded components. In contrast, by studying a function considered by Hardy, we give an example of a transcendental entire function for which the maximally and non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> sets each have uncountably many singleton components...|$|R
30|$|In Fig. 1, our {{result is}} plotted with {{numerical}} result reported in Newman et al. (1999). From Fig. 1 {{we can see}} that their computation time is not enough for the <b>escaping</b> mass to level off. It is possible that these researchers calculated the flow at the very early stage, during which the shock wave plays a dominant role in atmospheric acceleration. In such an early stage, a larger portion of the vapor cloud, which has most of the momentum, remains near the planetary surface. Also, our calculation shows that the <b>escaping</b> vapor cloud accounts for a large fraction of the total <b>escaping</b> mass. Though they did not distinguish the <b>escaping</b> vapor from the <b>escaping</b> atmosphere, it is speculated that the total <b>escaping</b> mass in Newman et al. (1999) mainly represents the <b>escaping</b> mass not of the atmosphere, but of the vapor cloud.|$|R

More than 75,000people– an average of more than seven people a day– were imprisoned for attempting to <b>escape</b> across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. Border guards who attempted to <b>escape</b> were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.|$|E

5|$|The Maze Prison <b>escape</b> (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great <b>Escape)</b> {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison <b>escape</b> in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the <b>escape</b> and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The <b>escape</b> was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign.
