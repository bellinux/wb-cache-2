The port of Los Cristianos (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.|$|E
25|$|Besides air transport, Tenerife has two {{principal}} maritime ports: the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Puerto de Santa Cruz), which serves the various capitals of the Canary Islands, {{especially those in}} the west; and the Port of Los Cristianos (Puerto de Los Cristianos), which serves the various island capitals of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The first port also has passenger services, which connect with the mainland port of Cádiz (and vice versa). There are plans to build a new port in the south of the island, in Granadilla de Abona, and in another in the west, at Fonsalía. The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port in the Canary Islands with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Statistical Yearbook of the State Ports 2006 (the latest of which is changing).

40|$|The {{present report}} aims to {{determine}} the currency of the present system for healthrelated control of frozen fishery products at border <b>inspection</b> <b>posts,</b> {{with regard to the}} pathogenic species of the genus Vibrio and more specifically, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. In view of the current scientific knowledge and risk assessment, the application of microbiological criteria at border <b>inspection</b> <b>posts</b> is justified as an additional and complementary control measure. With regard to V. cholerae specifically, it is recommended to apply a zero-tolerance criterion without distinguishing between serotypes. In case of serotypes other than O: 1 and O: 139, it is recommended to identify the products with the greatest risk for consumers and to adopt effective surveillance measures. With respect to V. parahaemolyticus, the application of a maximum limit of 102 cfu/g is considered adequate and the microbiological criterion and sampling plan established at border <b>inspection</b> <b>posts</b> for this species are adequate and sufficient. In catches from areas at risk, a special surveillance plan should be established as a preliminary step for the adoption of another kind of criterion. Similarly, it is recommended to extend the surveillance over fish and shellfish from areas at risk to V. vulnificus. In addition, it is recommended to keep certain caution with respect to the same areas (at risk) for any other species of Vibrio, particularly those considered here. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that the temperature at which fish and fish products are maintained is of critical importance in the control of potential outbreaks due to these micro-organisms. In Spain, in light of available data, the risk of suffering illness due to the ingestion of contaminated fishery products can be generally classified as very low...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} the requirements for veterinary border checks and procedures as a key pillar for preventing the introduction of any risks to human and animal health into a country originating from imports or transits of live animals and products thereof. To a certain extent also rules on animal welfare during transport of live animals have been taken into account considering the possibility of bottlenecks at the veterinary border <b>inspection</b> <b>posts.</b> Specific criteria and conditions for efficient and effective veterinary border checks are already laid down in specific chapters of the OIE Codes. Veterinary border checks need an all-inclusive legal framework and require a competent and credible Veterinary Service both at central and border post level. In addition, an adequate infrastructure for carrying out the veterinary border checks is required, which {{should be based on}} a long-term strategy and be properly resourced. Furthermore, harmonised procedures for performing the veterinary border checks should be in place, be transparent and based on scientific evidence.

This issue shows its importance when railway transportation comes to competition with other modes of transportation. In this competition, lower total cost means more demands and more benefits for optimum systems. Using preventive maintenance methods for rolling stock are among appropriate solutions in order to lower the costs.
