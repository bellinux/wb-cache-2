40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} simultaneous surgery for correcting senile blepharoptosis combined with upper eyelid entropion. METHODS: From June 2010 to June 2013, 30 cases(60 eyes) patients with senile blepharoptosis combined with upper eyelid entropion, received simultaneous surgery. The simultaneous surgery was upper eyelid <b>entropion</b> <b>correction</b> with levator palpebrae superioris muscle shortening and advancement. RESULTS: All cases were performed surgery successfully. The position of upper eyelid and the management of upper eyelid entropion were observed. The upper eyelid margin rested 1. 68 ± 0. 71 mm below the superior limbus at 1 wk, 1. 71 ± 0. 69 mm below the superior limbus at 1 mo, and 1. 70 ± 0. 65 mm below the superior limbus at 6 mo. Compared with the preoperative values, the difference were statistically significant(P CONCLUSION: Most of patients with senile upper eyelid entropion has senile blepharoptosis, Ophthalmologists should pay attention to those patients {{and give them the}} correct surgery techniques. It is effective to use upper eyelid <b>entropion</b> <b>correction</b> with levator palpebrae superioris muscle shortening and advancement to correct senile blepharoptosis with upper eyelid entropion...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate fornix-based suture placement as a method for <b>entropion</b> <b>correction</b> in the dog. Lower eyelid entropion with resultant trichiasis was corrected in 10 dogs using fornix-based suture placement similar to that employed in the Quickert–Rathbun technique used in man. A double-ended suture was placed originating at the deepest extent of the fornix and exiting the lid 1 – 2 mm from the eyelid margin. Degree of correction was assessed visually immediately after surgery and at re-examination with a follow-up period of up to 6 months. Fornix-based suture placement led to immediate eversion of the eyelid in each case and thus amelioration of the trichiasis in all dogs. In two cases eyelid eversion initially appeared over-corrected and in two cases exposure of conjunctival tissue was evident initially at the palpebral margin. In all cases, however, such complications were transient with long-term results giving an acceptable apposition between ocular surface and eyelid margin in all adult dogs. In three juvenile dogs on which the technique was used, further surgical treatment was required as the puppies grew. Fornix-based suture placement is a novel approach to <b>entropion</b> <b>correction</b> in the dog which yields acceptable results in the majority of suitable cases without recourse to incisional surgery...|$|E
40|$|In the {{management}} of trachomatous cicatricial entropion and trichiasis numerous surgical options are available to the surgeon, who, however, must choose the correct technique suitable to {{the severity of the}} condition. In general, severe cases do better with a graft of mucous membrane or skin. In this paper the use of another graft material, homologous sclera, in correcting entropion and trichiasis is discussed. A 1. 5 to 2 mm wide strip of fresh or preserved sclera was used as an inlay in a grey-line split technique with severance of pretarsal and Riolan's fibres in 155 <b>entropion</b> <b>corrections</b> in 136 patients. There was a success rate of 92. 3 % during the observation period of 15 months. Isolated trichiatic lashes were seen in 7. 7 %.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the functional and aesthetic outcomes of upper eyelid cicatricial <b>entropion</b> (UCE) <b>correction</b> using anterior lamellar recession (ALR) with addressing the associated conditions including dermatochalasis, brow ptosis, blepharoptosis, and lid retraction. METHODS: Chart review {{of patients with}} upper lid cicatricial entropion who had undergone ALR from 2013 to 2016 was reviewed. Success {{was defined as the}} lack of any lash in contact with the globe, no need for a second procedure, and acceptable cosmesis at the final follow up. RESULTS: Sixty eight patients (97 eyelids) were operated by ALR with simultaneous correction of associated lid problems in each case when necessary. The mean follow-up time was 17. 8 mo (range, 6. 0 - 24. 0 mo). Concomitantly, levator tucking was performed in 19 eyelids (19. 6...|$|R
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for <b>entropion,</b> and surgical <b>correction</b> may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections.

40|$|SUMMARY Cicatricial {{entropion}} {{resulting from}} trachoma occurs in various grades of severity. No one technique of surgical correction {{is suitable for}} all types. The technique has to be modified {{in accordance with the}} severity of the condition. A modified technique using skin graft is described, and excellent results (93 8 %) in 380 lid corrections with minimal recurrences during a follow-up period of over 2 years are presented. Entropion and trichiasis present in various grades of severity in areas where trachoma is endemic. No one method is suitable for surgical correction of these various grades of severity. This is why there are innumerable methods and modifications for <b>entropion</b> <b>correction.</b> A mild entropion may be corrected by a simple skin muscle excision, whereas a severely scarred lid calls for more radical methods with a combination of techniques. The choice of technique thus depends on the severity of entropion. Some of the available techniques are simple, others have more involved procedures, and some have certain drawbacks (Hadija, 1960) with consequent corneal changes. Some give higher success rates than others, depending on the aetiology and severity of entropion (Bercovici et al., 1977). This paper presents a modified method for correcting extensive cicatricial entropion and tri-chiasis which is simple, has fewer drawbacks, and is followed by fewer recurrences. Material and methods 380 eyes (360 bilateral, 20 unilateral) of 200 patients, predominantly female (170 females, 30 males) between the ages of 5 and 80 years (largest number between 15 and 56 years) were operated on for severe entropion/trichiasis resulting from tracho-matous scarring.

40|$|Kazuaki Nakauchi, Osamu MimuraDepartment of Ophthalmology, Hospital of Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, JapanPurpose: Involutional {{entropion}} is {{a common}} condition in Asian countries, including Japan. One cause of involutional entropion is weakening of the capsulopalpebral fascia (CPF). The aged, thin, membranous nature of the CPF limits the results of correction by the original Jones procedure (CPF tightening) alone, so we added the modified Hotz procedure to the entropion repair. We then compared the recurrence rates and operation times in corrections performed with and without this additional procedure. Cases: From April 2010 to December 2011, one surgeon performed lower-lid surgery using the Jones procedure {{with the addition of}} the modified Hotz procedure. Fifteen patients (a total of 21 eyes) underwent this combined procedure. Previously, the same surgeon performed the Jones procedure alone for eight patients (a total of nine eyes). Results: The average age of the two groups was 76. 4 years, with an age range of 66 &ndash; 85 years. All cases reported acceptable ciliary orientation {{at the end of the}} surgery. However, patients who underwent the Jones procedure alone (nine eyes total) reported three cases of recurrence after at least 6 months of follow-up. Patients who underwent the combined procedure reported two complications: one recurrence and one ectropion. The recurrence rate was 5 %. The Jones procedure using eyelid pinch required an average of 22. 6 minutes to complete; the combined method required 33. 4 minutes to complete. Conclusion: The combined method resulted in a significantly higher success rate than the Jones procedure alone (P &lt; 0. 05). The 5 % failure rate of the combined method was found to be superior to the 30 % recurrence rate of the Jones procedure. As a result, the Hotz procedure enhanced the results of the <b>entropion</b> <b>correction</b> and required only 10 additional minutes of surgery. We now perform this combined procedure for all cases. Keywords: Jones procedure, Hotz procedure, entropion, recurrence, operation tim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose: To {{report on}} the {{surgical}} management of concurrent ptosis and entropion in a patient with cicatricial pemphigoid. Case report: A 71 year-old patient presented with vision impairment and pain in the right eye due to entropion associated with trichiasis and mild-ptosis. He {{had a history of}} ocular cicatricial pemphigoid together with a lung cancer of the apex of the right lung with pleural involvement. There was a history of central retinal vein occlusion of the left eye. Clinical and orthoptic examination was conducted and a decision was made to perform surgical <b>correction</b> of the <b>entropion</b> followed by <b>correction</b> of ptosis avoiding the conjunctival approach. During surgery global alteration and anomalous anatomical relationships of the eyelid tissues was observed. Conclusion: In this patient affected by cicatricial ocular pemphigoid, surgery of both entropion and ptosis avoiding the conjunctiva approach, associated with good medical management of the immune reaction, and resulted in good esthetic and functional outcome without undesirable complications...|$|R
