Kumaari and Iyengar veetu azhage try to seep <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and Randakka tempts you to tap your feet. But only momentarily.

500|$|Since its release, Illmatic {{has become}} a {{benchmark}} for upcoming rappers whose albums are widely anticipated by critics. Hip hop pundits have viewed debut albums as crucial in generating publicity and shaping the legacy of an artist's career. Given the historic anticipation and acclaim surrounding Nas' debut, Illmatic {{has become a}} byword {{for this sort of}} phenomenon. As one columnist for the Complex Magazine writes, [...] "Think about the question that pops <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> whenever a new rapper drops his first album: 'Is it the next Illmatic?'" [...] In 2012, the release of Kendrick Lamar's album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, drew comparisons to Illmatic from critics and journalists. In an interview with 2 Dope Boyz, Lamar commented on these comparisons, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some pretty nice lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers entering this year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have some fun with the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't get <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E

2500|$|... "She Loves You" [...] is {{the song}} that thrust the Beatles {{full-scale}} into the British national spotlight. Part of this was {{the effectiveness of the}} song's hook; author Eric Starr wrote in retrospect, [...] "Each chorus or refrain pounds the hook <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> until it's imprinted in your brain." [...] As Nicholas Schaffner later wrote, it was [...] "'yeah, yeah, yeah' chanted repeatedly and emphatically enough to drive any listener out of his mind, one way or the other." ...|$|E

[...] Although he called the song catchy, Chris Richards of The Washington Post said Kingston [...] "hogs the mike" [...] on the song. Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic wrote about the lyrics, on the album review, that those are [...] "disturbing", but at the same time [...] "unintentionally hilarious." [...] She also criticized the production: [...] "There's not much to say about the kind of producer who thinks the use of the term 'shorty' with an elementary school gimmick is a good idea." [...] Luke O'Neil from The Boston Globe noted [...] "Sultry reggaeton is repackaged here for the tween set with Sean Kingston's 'Eenie Meenie.' Shorty' was never sung so literally." ...|$|E
