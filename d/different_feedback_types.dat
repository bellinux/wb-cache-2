40|$|ABSTRACT. Drivers ’ {{acceptance}} and reliance on technology that mitigate driver distraction depends on several factors including trust. Feedback regarding {{the degree of}} distraction can be provided in real-time or as post-trip information. Subjective ratings of trust were collected to assess the influence of these <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> in a driving simulator study in which drivers interacted with a distracting secondary task. The results suggest that trust changes over time and that this change is associated with acceptance of feedback, in particular its perceived usefulness. The timing of feedback {{did not have a}} significant impact on trust; however drivers generally trusted both feedback timings with males trusting feedback more than females. Understanding how trust develops in the various forms of feedback can provide designers with information to enhance the driver-vehicle interface and to better mitigate the effects of distraction...|$|E

40|$|Feedback is a {{very broad}} term {{involving}} {{many different ways of}} providing information to our students. The effectiveness of feedback has been largely debated throughout history.

40|$|The {{everyday}} act {{of speaking}} involves the complex processes of speech motor control. An {{important component of}} control is monitoring, detection, and processing of errors when auditory feedback does not correspond to the intended motor gesture. Here we show, using fMRI and converging operations within a multivoxel pattern analysis framework, that this sensorimotor process is supported by functionally differentiated brain networks. During scanning, a real-time speech-tracking system was used to deliver two acoustically different types of distorted auditory feedback or unaltered feedback while human participants were vocalizing monosyllabic words, and to present the same auditory stimuli while participants were passively listening. Whole-brain analysis of neural-pattern similarity revealed three functional networks that were differentially sensitive to distorted auditory feedback during vocalization, compared with during passive listening. One network of regions appears to encode an "error signal" regardless of acoustic features of the error: this network, including right angular gyrus, right supplementary motor area, and bilateral cerebellum, yielded consistent neural patterns across acoustically <b>different,</b> distorted <b>feedback</b> <b>types,</b> only during articulation (not during passive listening). In contrast, a frontotemporal network appears sensitive to the speech features of auditory stimuli during passive listening; this preference for speech features was diminished when the same stimuli were presented as auditory concomitants of vocalization. A third network, showing a distinct functional pattern from the other two, appears to capture aspects of both neural response profiles. Together, {{our findings suggest that}} auditory feedback processing during speech motor control may rely on multiple, interactive, functionally differentiated neural systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe used event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{to probe}} the effects of feedback in a hypothesis testing (HT) paradigm. Thirteen college students serially tested hypotheses concerning a hidden rule by judging its presence or absence in triplets of digits and revised them {{on the basis of}} an exogenous performance feedback. ERPs time-locked to performance feedback were then examined. The results showed differences between responses to positive and negative feedback at all cortical sites. Negative feedback, indicating incorrect performance, was associated to a negative deflection preceding a P 300 -like wave. Spatiotemporal principal component analysis (PCA) showed the interplay between early frontal components and later central and posterior ones. Lateralization of activity was selectively detectable at frontal sites, with a left frontal dominance for both positive and negative feedback. These results are discussed in terms of a proposed computational model of trial-to-trial feedback in HT in which the cognitive and emotive aspects of feedback are explicitly linked to putative mediating brain mechanisms.

Coded versus uncoded corrective feedback {{has been one of the}} rarely explored areas of investigation in SLA. To shed light on the factors that may explain such conflicting results, this study investigated the effect of coded and un-coded written corrective feedback with regard to possible improvements in the accuracy in writing of pre-intermediate EFL learners. It, further, sought whether such an effect would last in the long run. In the course of 14 weeks, learners’ errors in 2 groups (i. e., coded and uncoded) were reacted. A paired-samples t-test was run to analyze the obtained data. Analysis of the written pieces in the immediate post-test and delayed post test revealed that coded corrective feedback, compared to the uncoded group, had a significantly more positive influence on learners' accuracy improvement both in the short and in the long run. The findings imply that teachers should weigh the learners' abilities and interlanguage, proficiency level, and type of error before applying <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>types.</b> Moreover, the implications are discussed in terms of effective guidelines for teaching writing in EFL contexts...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveElectrophysiological {{studies on}} {{feedback}} processing typically use {{a wide range}} of feedback stimuli which might not always be comparable. The current study investigated whether two indicators of feedback processing – feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P 3 b – differ for feedback stimuli with explicit (facial expressions) or assigned valence information (symbols). In addition, we assessed whether presenting feedback in either a trial-by-trial or a block-wise fashion affected these ERPs. MethodsEEG was recorded in three experiments while participants performed a time estimation task and received two different types of performance feedback. ResultsOnly P 3 b amplitudes varied consistently in response to feedback type for both presentation types. Moreover, the blocked feedback type presentation yielded more distinct FRN peaks, higher effect sizes, and a significant relation between FRN amplitudes and behavioral task performance measures. ConclusionBoth stimulus type and presentation mode may provoke systematic changes in feedback-related ERPs. The current findings point at important potential confounds that need to be controlled for when designing FRN or P 3 b studies. SignificanceStudies investigating P 3 b amplitudes using mixed types of stimuli have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, we suggest implementing a blocked presentation format when presenting <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> within the same experiment...|$|E
40|$|An optimal discrete-time direct output-feedback control {{algorithm}} is developed with {{the consideration of}} sampling period and appropriate time delay in its control force action. Optimal-delayed output-feedback gains are derived through a variation process and will be complementarily arranged {{with respect to the}} applied delay time by either altering their magnitude or phases to assure the efficacy and stability of the delayed direct digital control system. Parametric studies of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems with <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> demonstrate the relationships of the delayed gains and the modal properties corresponding to the sampling period used and the intentionally delay time added. The maximum allowable delay time defined at the onset of instability of controlled system can be the optimal delay time that reaches the optimal control performance if the delay time is considered in the delayed feedback gains. The inclusion of sampling period and delay time in the optimization process for discrete-time control illustrates the beneficial effect under the same delay time. Numerical simulation results of proposed direct digital control principles on a three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) shaking table structure model show that the efficacy of the collocated control cases with optimal delay time to reduce the dynamic responses subjected to earthquake excitations is assured.

Currently, gaps in training exist between the professional courses a submarine officer attends over a career to learn and practice these skills. Following an instructional system design process, this thesis developed a 3 D, game-based periscope tactical training prototype. This part-task training solution can provide feedback on predetermined performance measures, either automated, real-time, or post-hoc. The second part of this thesis used the prototype environment to investigate the impact of <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> on performance.
