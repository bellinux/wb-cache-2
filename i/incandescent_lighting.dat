5|$|The Simpsons Ride uses new {{technology}} that cuts down on its energy consumption. According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 watts on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day. The ride includes over 2,500 LEDs, the largest number in theme park history, which allows the ride {{to cut down on}} lighting energy by almost one quarter when compared to <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E

25|$|The {{gasworks}} {{are still}} a prominent feature {{on the island and}} the cable-powered tramway was partly built to haul wagons full of coal up to it from the North Port. Two gasholders held the coal gas that powered both the compressed air pump and the lighthouse light, however in 1911 the light was converted to <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> which was powered by electricity. The gas works became redundant at this time. Lawson records that oil was used to produce the gas for the lighthouse light.|$|E
25|$|In warm climates where air {{conditioning}} is used, any household device that gives off heat {{will result in}} a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as a stove, dish washer, clothes dryer, hot water and <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E
25|$|Reflectors {{can also}} be used to {{selectively}} reduce or eliminate unwanted thermal emission. Incandescent lamps produce light through heating of the filament, while arc lamps produce light through the heating and ionization of a gas. In either case, this heat is also emitted from the lamp as infrared light. The thermal energy is often projected onto the stage with the visible light, and thousands of watts of <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> can be uncomfortably hot for the actors on stage. Specially designed reflectors are able to absorb and dissipate infrared at the fixture before the visible light reaches the stage.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas with}} {{coal-fired}} power stations, {{the use of}} CFLs saves on mercury emissions {{when compared to the}} use of incandescent bulbs. This is due to the reduced electrical power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned. In July 2008 the U.S. EPA published a data sheet stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> of comparable lumen output. This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U.S. electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill. Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals, sulfur, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The cars as {{delivered}} featured rattan {{seats and}} <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> staples of most pre-WWII subway cars in New York City. All {{areas of the}} cars were lit, as bulbs were placed along the center roofline and {{down the sides of}} each car's interior. Additionally, pairs of bulbs on each end lit each end vestibule. As delivered, they did not come with fans, however windows and clerestory vents along the upper roof could be opened for ventilation. All windows were drop sash type (rather than rising sash type) for improved safety and {{to reduce the amount of}} draught in moving cars. Floors were made of wood (maple), and grab holds were provided along the roof for standees. Originally, these grab holds were made of leather (as on elevated trains), and later replaced with the steel grab holds that were IRT standard for many years.|$|E
25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60hertz. Some countries have a mixture of 50Hz and 60Hz supplies, notably electricity power transmission in Japan. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type traction motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60Hz by the late 1950s, although some 25Hz industrial customers still existed as of {{the start of the}} 21st century. 16.7Hz power (formerly 16 2/3Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer mainframe systems were often powered by 400Hz or 415Hz for benefits of ripple reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units. In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200V (Japan), 208V, 240V (North America), 380V, 400V or 415V (Europe), and variously 50Hz or 60Hz.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of <b>incandescent</b> <b>lighting</b> with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E
