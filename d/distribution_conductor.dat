40|$|Abstract – A {{current flowing}} through a <b>distribution</b> <b>conductor</b> {{produces}} induced voltage, which is harmful to a telecommunication line. Previous research on induced voltage {{has been focused}} on single-circuit lines in the distribution system. However, the double-circuit lines, referred to as parallel distribution lines, are widely used in distribution systems because they have significant economic and environmental advantages over single-circuit lines. Therefore, a study on the induced voltage in double-circuit lines is needed. This paper presents a method of calculating the induced voltage in a parallel distribution system using four-terminal parameters and vector analysis. The calculation method is verified by the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulation...|$|E

The voltage level was chosen for convenience in lamp manufacture; high-resistance carbon filament lamps could be constructed to withstand 100 volts, and to provide lighting performance economically competitive with gas lighting.

Impedance is a combination of two quantities: resistance and reactance. The resistances of ASCR conductors are tabulated for different conductor designs by the manufacturer at DC and AC frequency assuming specific operating temperatures. The reasons that resistance changes with frequency are largely due to the skin effect, the proximity effect, and [...] hysteresis loss. Depending on the geometry of the conductor as differentiated by the conductor name, these phenomena have varying degrees of affecting the overall resistance in the conductor at AC vs DC frequency.|$|R
