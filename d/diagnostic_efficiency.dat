40|$|ObjectivesThe study {{sought to}} assess the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) in identifying hemodynamically severe coronary stenoses as determined by fractional flow reserve (FFR). Concomitant OCT and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) area measurements were performed in a subgroup of patients to compare the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of both techniques. BackgroundThe value of OCT to determine stenosis severity remains unsettled. MethodsSixty-one stenoses with intermediate angiographic severity were studied in 56 patients. Stenoses were labeled as severe if FFR ≤ 0. 80. OCT interrogation was performed in all cases, with concomitant IVUS imaging in 47 cases. ResultsAngiographic stenosis severity was 50. 9 ± 8 % diameter stenosis with 1. 28 ± 0. 3 mm minimal lumen diameter. FFR was ≤ 0. 80 in 28 (45. 9 %) stenoses. An overall moderate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of OCT was found (area under the curve [AUC]: 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 61 to 0. 84), with sensitivity/specificity of 82 %/ 63 % associated with an optimal cutoff value of 1. 95 mm 2. Comparison of the results in patients with simultaneous IVUS and OCT imaging revealed {{no significant differences in}} the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of OCT (AUC: 0. 70; 95 % CI: 0. 55 to 0. 83) and IVUS (AUC. 0. 63; 95 % CI: 0. 47 to 0. 77; p = 0. 19). Sensitivity/specificity for IVUS was 67 %/ 65 % for an optimal cutoff value of 2. 36 mm 2. In the subgroup of small vessels (reference diameter < 3 mm) OCT showed a significantly better <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (AUC: 0. 77; 95 % CI: 0. 60 to 0. 89) than IVUS (AUC: 0. 63; 95 % CI: 0. 46 to 0. 78) to identify functionally significant stenoses (p = 0. 04). ConclusionsOCT has a moderate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> in identifying hemodynamically severe coronary stenoses. Although OCT seems slightly superior to IVUS for this purpose (particularly in vessels < 3 mm), its low specificity precludes its use as a substitute of FFR for functional stenosis assessment...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} value of serum microRNA 21 (miR 21) and other tumor markers in early diagnosis of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Methods. Serums carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21 - 1), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and miR 21 were detected in 50 NSCLC cases and 60 healthy control individuals. Results. Average serums miR 21, CEA, NSE, and CYFRA 21 - 1 levels {{were significantly higher}} in the case group than in control group (P< 0. 01). Analysis of areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) revealed that CEA had the highest <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> for NSCLC. Serums miR 21 and CYFRA 21 - 1 levels were significantly lower at TNM stages I-II than stages III-IV (P< 0. 05). Further, logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that the incidence of early NSCLC (TNM stages I-II) was correlated with serums CYFRA 21 - 1 (OR = 1. 076) and miR 21 (OR = 2. 473) levels (P< 0. 05). By AUC analysis, miR 21 had the highest <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> for early NSCLC, and single or combined detection of serums CYFRA 21 - 1 and miR 21 levels showed improved <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency</b> for joint detection of both markers. Conclusions. Serum miR 21 could serve as an important marker for auxiliary diagnosis of early NSCLC, while joint detection of serums miR 21 and CYFRA 21 - 1 levels could improve <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{serodiagnosis}} of hydatid {{disease is}} a valuable instrument for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of high-risk populations. In the past decade a wealth of reports on the diagnostic performance of numerous antigens have been produced. However, their diagnostic value has been estimated under different conditions, using different serum collection, therefore precluding their direct comparison. Here we report an unbiased comparison of the same batch of six major E. granulosus antigens, namely, hydatid cyst fluid (HCF), native antigen B (AgB), two recombinant AgB subunits, an AgB-derived synthetic peptide, and recombinant cytosolic malate dehydrogenase from E. granulosus (EgMDH), against the same serum collection. The double-blind analysis was performed using a standardized protocol and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) data analysis by a network of six South American laboratories. High intercenter reproducibility was attained, and the intralaboratory analysis allowed the comparative ranking of the antigen panel. HCF, AgB, and its AgB 8 / 1 subunit exhibited equivalent <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> 81. 4 % +/- 0. 5 %, 81. 3 % +/- 0. 6 %, and 81. 9 % +/- 2. 0 %, respectively; with a more favorable balance toward specificity {{in the case of}} the last antigen. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the other three antigens were 76. 8 % +/- 6. 8 %, 69. 1 % +/- 2. 7 %, and 66. 8 % +/- 2. 1 %, for the peptide, the AgB 8 / 2 subunit, and the EgMDH, respectively.

Results Baseline levels of cystatin C in amniotic fluid were significantly higher (P = 0. 0015) among cases than in controls with comparable gestational age; no significant difference was found for creatinine levels (P = n. s.). The maximum diagnostic accuracy of serum cystatin C in discriminating controls from fetal uropathies was 96 %, while that of creatinine was 62 %. Conclusion Cystatin C may be considered a sensitive biochemical marker for the early identification of fetuses with obstructive uropathies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Organic acid {{disorders}} are a heterogeneous group of inborn errors of metabolism, in which organic acids accumulate in the body. They have high prevalence in Egypt {{because of a}} high rate of consanguineous marriages. Here we report our experience with the diagnostic evaluation of patients with organic acidemias as well as several other inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS–MS), gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and by isocratic cation exchange “high-performance liquid-chromatography” (HPLC) to evaluate the use of HPLC method for disease-associated metabolite screening. Patients and methods: In this study, we screened 86 suspected Egyptians patients with organic acid disorders by LC/MS–MS, GC/MS and by HPLC aged from 3  days to 12  years old. Data obtained from the three methods were statistically analyzed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the HPLC method over the other two methods and to pursue its precision in the diagnosis of organic acid disorders. Moreover, 17 urine samples were collected from patients with several other IEMs to evaluate the efficiency of HPLC in detecting abnormal metabolites in urine samples. Results: The screening results showed that <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were varied among the three methods, HPLC showing a higher sensitivity of detecting normal urine as well as a highly satisfactory extent for the detection of different metabolic disorders. In addition, some typical urinary HPLC chromatograms of different metabolic disorders were presented to help the investigator who is going to start an organic aciduria screening program by HPLC to be familiar with various patterns. Conclusion: This study has indicated that HPLC is an easy applicable and useful technique for the initial screening of organic acid disorders and many other disease associated metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by two facts: 1. the formation of populous star cluster systems is widely observed to accompany violent star formation episodes in gas-rich galaxies as e. g. those triggered by strong interactions or merging. 2. The Globular Cluster (GC) systems of most but not all early-type galaxies show bimodal optical color distributions with fairly universal blue peaks and somewhat variable red peak colors, yet their Luminosity Functions (LFs) look like simple Gaussians with apparently universal turn-over magnitudes that are used for distance measurements and the determination of Ho. Based on {{a new set of}} evolutionary synthesis models for Simple (= single burst) Stellar Populations (SSPs) of various metallicities using the latest Padova isochrones I study the color and luminosity evolution of GC populations over the wavelength range from U through K, providing an extensive grid of models for comparison with observations. I assume the intrinsic widths of the color distributions and LFs to be constant in time at the values observed today for the Milky Way or M 31 halo GC populations. Taking the color distributions and LFs of the Milky Way or M 31 halo GC population as a reference for old metal-poor GC populations in general, I study for which combinations of age and metallicity a secondary GC population formed in some violent star formation event in the history of its parent galaxy {{may or may not be}} detected in the observed GC color distributions. I also investigate the effect of these secondary GCs on the LFs of the total GC system. Significant differences are found among the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in various wavelengt...|$|R
