5000|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> have shiny {{white flesh}} with an easily recognizable, broad-flaked {{structure}} and a mild flavor. They {{have traditionally been}} one of the most popular targets for Japanese anglers. In the Kantō region, including Shizuoka Prefecture, it is called seigo when under 25 cm. At three years of age, when it has attained a length of near 60 cm, it is called fukko or suzuki. Because their name changes as they grow - in Japanese such fish are called [...] (shusseuo) - the Japanese have associated them with advancement in life and believe <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> symbolizes good fortune.|$|E

50|$|Sebastes inermis (Sea-perch, dark-banded {{rockfish}}) is {{a species}} of rockfish native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean where it occurs off the coasts of Japan and the Korean Peninsula. This species grows to a length of 35 cm TL and the heaviest recorded specimen weighed 800 g. This fish is important to both commercial fisheries and the sport fishing industry. It is also raised to supply market demand. The Japanese sea-perches are twice more expensive than that European sea-bass. Sometimes the Japanese seaperch mix up Japanese seaperch and <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass,</b> also suzuki (鱸) (Lateolabrax japonicus), is {{a species}} of Asian seabass native to the western Pacific Ocean, where it occurs from Japan to the South China Sea. They inhabit fresh, brackish, and marine waters of inshore rocky reefs and in {{estuaries}} at depths of at least 5 m. This species is catadromous, with the young ascending rivers and then returning to the sea to breed. This species can reach a length of 102 cm, though most do not exceed 16.1 cm. The greatest weight recorded for this species is 8.7 kg. This species is important commercially, popular as a game fish, and farmed.|$|E
40|$|A 10 -week growth {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of dietary cornstarch levels on the growth performance, body composition, liver/muscle glycogen, and selected serum biomarkers, of <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> in grow-out phase. Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets containing graded levels (0 %, 6 %, 12 %, 18 %, 24 %, 30 %) of cornstarch were fed to <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> (initial weight 343 g). Weight gain (WG) significantly increased up to 18 % with increasing dietary cornstarch, and then reached a plateau. There {{was no significant difference}} in WG between fish fed 18 %, 24 %, or 30 % cornstarch (P> 0. 05). Based on WG, the optimal dietary cornstarch level of <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> estimated by second-order polynomial model was 27. 0 %. Body protein and lipid content as well as total cholesterol and triglycerides in serum showed similar trends, i. e. increasing at first and then reaching a plateau despite increasing levels of dietary cornstarch. Ash content decreased at first and then reached a plateau with increasing dietary cornstarch. Hepatosomatic index and liver glycogen significantly increased with increasing dietary cornstarch (P 18 %) could improve the growth performance of <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> and the optimal dietary cornstarch level is 27. 0 % during grow out phase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This article {{describes}} the growth, mortal-ity, and selection patterns in early larval stage of <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> Lateolabrax japonicus in Ariake Bay, Kyushu, Japan. <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> larvae were collected from the spawning ground in December 2007, and juveniles were collected from the nursery ground in March 2008. Otoliths were analyzed to produce daily records of size-at-age and growth rate that were compared between larvae and juveniles to determine whether selective mortality occurred. A weight-specific growth coefficient (G) and instanta-neous mortality coefficient (M) were computed, and the recruitment potential was evaluated from the ratio of M:G. Selection for fast-growing and bigger larvae was evident during the 5 – 14 days after hatchin...|$|E
40|$|The optimal lipid {{requirements}} in <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> {{of two different}} sizes (initial body weight, 34. 26 ± 0. 37 g, and 343. 3 ± 10. 0 g) were tested using the same experimental diets in two feeding trials (trial I and trial II). Five experimental diets were formulated to obtain graded dietary lipid levels: 0. 6 %, 3. 9 %, 7. 3 %, 11. 7 %, and 15. 8 %. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of fish. Both feed trials lasted 10 weeks. The results in both feeding trials showed that specific growth rate significantly increased by increasing dietary lipid levels from 0. 6 % to 7. 3 %, and declined thereafter. Based on the specific growth rate, the optimum dietary lipid requirement of the small and large <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> was 7. 4 % and 9. 9 % respectively. The increasing dietary lipid levels significantly increased the fish body protein concentration, but only in feeding trial II. In both feeding trials, the lipid contents in whole fish body and liver significantly increased with increasing dietary lipid levels, but the small fish showed much lower lipid content than the large fish. The serum triglyceride concentrations in the small fish were higher {{than those in the}} large fish. High levels of dietary lipid (3. 9 % and 7. 3 %) reduced the serum cholesterol concentrations in the small fish, which was much lower than those in the large fish. These results suggested that the lipid requirements, as well as the body composition and lipid deposition differed according to the size of growing <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass.</b> The results are important for feed formulation for aquaculture of different sized <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> throughout their production cycle...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile {{silversides}} (Odontesthes regia Humboldt, 1821) {{reared in}} a sea net pen system performed well and adapted rapidly {{to this type of}} confinement. Values obtained for growth and mortality parameters in a period of 12 months, are similar to those observed in other marine fish cultured at industrial levels. The value of SGR obtained for the whole period (0. 57), was similar to the value obtained in trials with juvenile rainbow trout using 20 % replacement of fishmeal with white lupin meal (Lupino albus), over a period of 6 months (SGR= 0. 58), but lower in relation to trials performed with red tilapia fry (Oreochromis aureus x Oreochromis niloticus) fed with coffee pulp diet (20 % fishmeal replacement) where SGR was 1. 51, or when compared with <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> (Lateolabrax japonicus) fed with rations based on 30 % fishmeal replacement with soybean meal (SGR= 2. 98) over a 153 days trial. Mortality rate observed during the 12 months for the marine silverside reared in sea net pens, was in the range of typical values observed for rainbow trout reared in freshwater (17, 9 % in 14 months), or for Atlantic salmon in freshwater (22 % from egg to smolt in 13 months); but lower in relation to mortality observed on <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> (50. 7 %) and red tilapia (34, 5 %), where the experimental period was about half of Odontesthes regia...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the influences of different dietary fatty acid profiles on the tissue content and biosynthesis of LC-PUFA in a euryhaline species <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> reared in seawater. Six diets were prepared, each with a characteristic fatty acid: Diet PA: Palmitic acid (C 16 : 0); Diet SA: Stearic acid (C 18 : 0); Diet OA: Oleic acid (C 18 : 1 n- 9); Diet LNA: α-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3); Diet N- 3 LC-PUFA: n- 3 LC-PUFA (DHA+EPA); Diet FO: the fish oil control. A 10 -week feeding trial was conducted using juvenile fish (29. 53 ± 0. 86 g). The results showed that <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> had limited capacity to synthesize LC-PUFA and fish fed PA, SA, OA and LNA showed significantly lower tissue n- 3 LC-PUFA contents compared to fish fed N- 3 LC-PUFA and FO. The putative gene promoter and full-length cDNA of FADS 2 was cloned and characterized. The protein sequence was confirmed to be homologous to FADS 2 s of marine teleosts and possessed all the characteristic features of microsomal fatty acid desaturases. The FADS 2 transcript levels in liver of fish fed N- 3 LC-PUFA and FO were significantly lower than those in fish fed other diets except LNA while Diet PA significantly up-regulated the FADS 2 gene expression compared to Diet LNA, N- 3 LC-PUFA and FO. Inversely, fish fed N- 3 LC-PUFA and FO showed significantly higher promoter methylation rates of FADS 2 gene compared to fish fed the LC-PUFA deficient diets. These results suggested that <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> had low LC-PUFA synthesis capacity and LC-PUFA deficient diets caused significantly reduced tissue n- 3 LC-PUFA contents. The liver gene expression of FADS 2 was up-regulated in groups enriched in C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 n- 9 respectively but not in the group enriched in C 18 : 3 n- 3 compared to groups with high n- 3 LC-PUFA contents. The FADS 2 gene expression regulated by dietary fatty acids was significantly negatively correlated with the methylation rate of putative FADS 2 gene promoter...|$|E
40|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass,</b> Lateolabrax japonicus (mean {{initial weight}} 204. 5 g) were fed {{one of six}} casein-dextrin-based diets {{containing}} graded levels of magnesium (Mg) (184, 278, 487, 929, 1299, and 1737 mg/kg) for 10 weeks with the water-borne Mg concentration of 985 mg/L. Magnesium sulphate {{was used as the}} Mg source in the diets. The experiment was carried out in floating sea cages. Growth, survival rate, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondiadehyde (MDA) contents and tissue mineral contents were measured to investigate the effect of dietary magnesium in seabass. After 10 weeks, dietary magnesium supplementation did not improve the growth performance or feed efficiency of adult seabass. On the contrary, negative effects on growth performance, decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased malondiadehyde (MDA) contents were observed in seabass fed Mg diets with 929, 1299 mg/kg and 1737 mg/kg, and feed efficiency (FE) exhibited a decreasing tendency with increasing Mg supplemental levels, which indicates the Mg requirement of seabass was met in fish fed the basal diet. Survival, hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index, condition factor, and Mg and Ca concentration in whole-body, vertebrae, and scales were not affected by dietary Mg supplementation (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Two cultured marine fish, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>seabass</b> (Lateolabrax japonicus) and red {{seabream}} (Pagrus major) {{were collected from}} eight fish cage sites {{along the coast of}} Fujian province in China. The concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in their muscle, stomach and liver tissue were quantified. The risk of these trace elements to humans through fish consumption was then assessed. The highest concentrations of As, Cd, Se and Zn in fish feed from fish cages were found in Dongshan Station. Moreover, the As levels in the muscles of both species at all sites were generally higher than China's national standard (> 1. 0 mu g/g). Trace element concentrations in two marine fish followed the order of livers > stomachs > muscles. Although the As levels in two marine caged fish exceeded the permissible standards, the estimated daily intake of As did not exceed the reference dose guideline established by US EPA. For other trace elements examined in this study, their concentrations did not exceed the permissible concentrations of the international standards. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
