Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only straw (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter, {{to get all the}} energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals, and others advise against <b>feeding</b> <b>straw.</b> [...] They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought.

40|$|An {{experiment}} involving three feeding trials {{was conducted}} to study the effect of substituting chopped wheat straw for alfalfa in diets for lactating dairy cows. The results of these trials have shown that in complete mixed diets or diets containing long alfalfa hay, replacement of half of the alfalfa in rations containing 45 % roughage for lactating dairy cows with chopped wheat straw does not adversely affect DM intake or milk yield and increase milk fat percentage. Replacing half of the long alfalfa with chopped alfalfa also apparently improved lactational performance although not as dramatically as that of chopped straw. Ammoniation of wheat straw did not improve the performance response by lactating cows. Inclusion of chopped straw in the diets seemed to enhance the efficiency of milk production. Higher ruminal acetate:propionate ratios and increased digestibility of ether extract resulted from <b>feeding</b> <b>straw.</b> Digestibility of other nutrients were generally either not affected or were depressed by straw feeding. Increasing the chopped wheat straw level to 75 % of the roughage resulted in lower DM intake and milk yield and negative body weight gains but higher milk fat levels. It did not appear that maintenance of constant ADF level in a dairy ration regardless of roughage level was {{the solution to the}} maintenance of milk fat levels. Thus it has been indicated that under the conditions of this experiment a combination of chopped alfalfa and wheat straw can be used successfully in complete mixed rations for high producing dairy cows. For the most part all productive parameters measured were improved by the addition of straw and by the feeding of complete mixed diets. This was especially true for milk fat which, from a dairyman's viewpoint, is very important because of its impact on milk pricing. It would also have a direct bearing on management by reducing labor costs through elimination of labor intensive handling of long alfalfa. Mechanical handling of complete mixed rations is relatively easier and cheaper...|$|E
40|$|Field trials {{suggest that}} the nutritive value of high quality, high {{moisture}} feeds may be improved {{by the addition of}} a small quantity of roughage. The nutritional value to steers of two high qualities, high moisture feeds, fresh cut pasture and pressed beet pulp silage (PBPS), with and without various levels of straw was investigated. The general effects of straw substitution on the two diets and possible associative effect on DMD and MRT of DM, PEG and Cr-mordanted straw in the reticulo-rumen were measured in steers. Barley straw was fed with pasture at 0, 20, 50 and 100 % of DMI in a 4 x 4 Latin Square design over an 80 day period, and with PBPS at 0, 50 and 100 % of DMI in a 3 x 3 Latin Square design over 60 days to rumen fistulated steers. On two selected days, a single meal was offered to steers and from 0 to 12 hours after feeding total rumen contents were baled and weighed on four occasions. At 0 hr, PEG and Cr-mordanted fibre as liquid and solid phase markers were mixed with rumen contents. Rumen digesta was sub-sampled for OM, PEG and Cr analysis at each baling session. In vivo DM and OM digestibility’s were measured from day 10 to 20. The general effect of adding 10 % straw to pasture and PBPS was to reduce DMD by 2 % units and 1. 8 % units respectively. MRT of DM, PEG and Cr in the rumen increased by 1. 6, 0. 5 and 1. 2 % for pasture, and by 1. 0, - 1. 2 and 1. 0 % for PBPS respectively for every 10 % increase in straw level in diet. There was little associative effect on DMD of feeding barley straw with PBPS, but an increase of 1. 8 % units and 3. 1 % units over predicted values were measured with 20 % and 50 % straw DM fed with pasture. MRT for DM was 1. 0 and 10. 0 % shorter at 20 % and 50 % straw with pasture respectively, and 6. 5 % shorter at 50 % straw level with PBPS than would have been predicted from results of the diets fed separately. Similarly, shorter retention times for PEG, and Cr were observed when straw was fed with pasture or PBPS. A possible explanation for the positive associative effect on DMD of <b>feeding</b> <b>straw</b> with pasture is that pasture and/or straw digestibility was improved. Because straw DMD was likely to be close to its potential, it was calculated that pasture had to improve by 2. 3 % units on 20 % straw and by 6. 2 % units on 50 % straw fed with pasture to give the DMD values attained on the mixed diets. Had the improvement in digestibility of the mixed diets been due to an improvement in DMD of straw only, the DMD of straw would have to improve 9 % units with the 20 %, and 6. 2 % units with the 50 % straw supplemented diets. Total OM mass of the rumen was higher at all times on the straw supplemented diets compared with the 100 % pasture diet. This potential source of slow releasing energy in the rumen may allow better utilization of the high levels of ammonia in rumen fluid from pasture degradation. The trend towards shorter retention times of digesta in the rumen when straw is fed with pasture or PBPS, is likely to pass soluble carbohydrates and N into the small intestines, possibly improving ME utilization, and voluntary intake of the diets...|$|E

To this end, in a first approach, the matrix effect has been evaluated in two ways: monitoring the signal of a compound (added to the mobile phase) during the entire chromatographic run, and by classical post-extraction addition. The study was focused on nine selected mycotoxins: Aflatoxin B 1, fumonisins B 1, B 2 and B 3, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins and zearalenone in various sample extracts giving moderate to strong matrix effects (maize, compound <b>feed,</b> <b>straw,</b> spices). Although the permanent monitoring of a compound provided a qualitative way of evaluating the matrix effects at each retention time, we concluded that it was not adequate as a quantitative approach to correct for the matrix effect. Matrix effects measured by post-extraction addition showed that the strongest ion suppression occurred for the spices (up to - 89 %). Five different calibration approaches to compensate for matrix effects were compared: multi-level external calibration using isotopically labelled internal standards, multi-level and single level standard addition, and two ways of singlepoint internal calibration: one point isotopic internal calibration and isotope pattern deconvolution. In general, recoveries and precision meeting the European Union requirements could be achieved with all approaches, {{with the exception of the}} single level standard addition at levels too close to the concentration in the sample.

Four rice varieties (Wuyujing 3, Nanjing 44, Nanjing 46 and Liangyoupeijiu) were used in the experiment, with one GA spraying time in 2013 (the 15 th day after anthesis) and three GA spraying times in 2014 (the 7 th, 15 th and 21 st day after anthesis) being set, and the rice was harvested on two occasions in 2013 and 2014 (harvest time 1 when the grains of the control group plants had reached 80 % maturity, and harvest time 2 occurring 6 days after harvest time 1). GA concentration was 45 g hm− 2 in both years. The results indicated that at normal harvest time (harvest time 1), the optimum GA treatment for Liangyoupeijiu was an application on the 7 th day after anthesis, but for Nanjing 44 and Nanjing 46, the optimum GA treatment was an application on the 21 st day after anthesis.

Fifteen steers were allocated to three diets during the growing and fattening periods (3. 1 and 9. 8 months, respectively) : a control diet (concentrate mix and free access to rice straw), a 50 % BF-based silage diet (control diet+ 50 % of maximum BF-based silage intake), and a 100 % BF-based silage diet (the same amount of concentrate mix and ad libitum BF-based silage). The BF-based silage was fed during the growing and fattening periods, and was replaced with larger particles of rice straw during the finishing period. After 19. 6 months of the whole period all the steers were slaughtered. Compared with <b>feeding</b> rice <b>straw,</b> <b>feeding</b> BF-based silage tended (p = 0. 10) to increase the average daily gain (27 %) and feed efficiency (18 %) of the growing steers, caused by increased voluntary feed intake. Feeding BF-based silage had little effect on serum constituents, electrolytes, enzymes, or the blood cell profiles of fattening steers, except for low serum Ca and high blood urea concentrations (p< 0. 05). Feeding BF-based silage did not affect cold carcass weight, yield traits such as back fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, yield index or yield grade, or quality traits such as meat color, fat color, texture, maturity, marbling score, or quality grade. However, it improved good quality grade (1 + and 1 ++) appearance rates (60 % for the control group vs 100 % for the BF-based silage-fed groups). In conclusion, cheap BF-based silage could be successfully used as a good quality roughage source for beef cattle...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} on screening and isolation of cellulolytic bacteria from the gut of larvae Black Soldier treated rice <b>straw</b> <b>feed</b> has been conducted. The {{purpose of this}} study is to get the type of cellulolytic bacteria from the gut of larvae and bacteria that have the highest potential to degrade cellulose. Screening and isolation method applied by using intestinal larvae obtained from larval gut vortex at a speed of 1500 rpm. Furthermore, dilution graded from 1 to 10 and grown in media CMC (carboxyl methyl cellulose) at 37 0 C and incubated for 48 hours. Observations were made based on the characteristics of the microscopic, macroscopic, biochemical test, cellulolytic activity and the activity of cellulase enzymes selected bacteria. The results showed a 9 cellulolytic bacteria from the gut of the larvae. Bacillus sp. is a bacteria that have the highest potential with cellulolitic activity 2. 1 mm (dz/dk), the exponential phase of hour at the 24 th, and cellulase enzyme activity of 0. 4 U/mL at pH 7 and 0. 41 U/mL at pH 8. This research showed that the Black Soldier Flays Larvae (Hermetia illucens) have competencein organic waste degradation, because in Black Soldier Flays Larvae’s gut, cellulolitic enzyme is produced by cellulolitic bacteria, specially Bacillus sp, How to Cite Supriyatna, A., & Ukit, U.
