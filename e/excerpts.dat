50|$|After the introduction, {{the main}} {{subjects}} are exposed. The first subject (<b>Excerpt</b> 13), exposed on viola, is induced from <b>Excerpt</b> 1.Following a brief conclusion with {{a fragment of}} <b>Excerpt</b> 12, a series of second subjects appear: <b>Excerpt</b> 14, which is a transformation of <b>Excerpt</b> 4; <b>Excerpt</b> 15, played with rigorous accompaniment of <b>Excerpt</b> 12; and the encouraging <b>Excerpt</b> 16.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{movement}} is coloured by [...] lightness. Impressive ascending repeated notes, {{as shown in}} <b>Excerpt</b> 6, open the movement’s F-sharp minor scherzo. Effective frequent tacet insertions are observed here.Another main subject, <b>Excerpt</b> 7, is played by first violin in contrasting fluent manner.The D minor trio, based on <b>Excerpt</b> 8, is also interrupted by whole rests elongated with fermata. In the middle of trio, the cello covertly plays <b>Excerpt</b> 1.Afterwards, <b>Excerpt</b> 6, accompanied with pizzicato, comes back and is soon bridged to <b>Excerpt</b> 7. The movement ends with a quiet pizzicato coda featuring <b>Excerpt</b> 8.|$|R
50|$|After the {{recapitulation}} of <b>excerpt</b> 1, <b>excerpt</b> 2 leads coda, which mainly uses <b>excerpt</b> 1 and magnificently concludes the work.|$|R

50|$|In the development, Franck {{combines}} the major subjects in counterpoint. <b>Excerpt</b> 1 is added and <b>Excerpt</b> 12 repeatedly appears {{to change the}} atmosphere. Although {{the beginning of the}} recapitulation is not clear, the second reappearance of the first subject, at approximately 500 bars, is followed by the second subjects. At the end of the recapitulation, <b>Excerpt</b> 6 suddenly emerges from silence. This marks the advent of the coda, where <b>Excerpt</b> 6 dominates in counterpoint with <b>Excerpt</b> 13. At the final climax, <b>Excerpt</b> 9 is sung dramatically in augmentation. Contained emotion after the climax turns into <b>Excerpt</b> 12, in , which rushes into the conclusion.|$|R

50|$|Two times <b>excerpt</b> 1, {{played on}} Grand Orgue, is {{answered}} by <b>excerpt</b> 2 on Récit. <b>Excerpt</b> 1, this time appearing on pedal, is passed to Grand Orgue, accompanied by <b>excerpt</b> 3. After the brief {{climax of the}} introduction, the first subject of the sonata form begins (Allegro non troppo e maestoso, 2/2, <b>excerpt</b> 4). It ties the whole work as a cyclic theme (thème cyclique). Yashiro pointed out the similarity between this theme and that of Franck’s symphony in D minor.|$|R

50|$|The finale in {{extended}} sonata form. <b>Excerpt</b> 12 {{begins with}} a fast unison phrase, then connects the main subjects from the previous movements: <b>Excerpt</b> 9 from third movement, <b>Excerpt</b> 6 from second movement, and <b>Excerpt</b> 1 from first movement. This “summary” {{is similar to the}} finale from Beethovens ninth symphony; Franck himself had used the same method in his organ piece Grande Pièce Symphonique.|$|R
5|$|A happier family event from Cosima's {{standpoint}} was Siegfried's {{marriage in}} 1915, {{at the age}} of 46, to Winifred Williams, the 18-year-old foster-daughter of Karl Klindworth who had been friends with both Wagner and Liszt. When the couple's first son, Wieland, was born on 5 January 1917, Cosima celebrated by playing <b>excerpts</b> from the Siegfried Idyll on Wagner's piano.|$|E

The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and <b>excerpts</b> from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first part}} of this {{movement}} is in ternary form itself, and <b>Excerpt</b> 9 reappears after the exposition of <b>Excerpt</b> 10.In the second part of this movement, a passionate melody is exhibited by the first violin over the accompaniment of extended arpeggios (<b>Excerpt</b> 11). That melody has already appeared in the middle voice during the exposition of <b>Excerpt</b> 10. Repeated modulation prevents an obvious determination of tonality, though the key signature is C major.After the climax of the middle part, <b>Excerpt</b> 9 is recapitulated in ppp. This third part is not a simple reemerging of the first part; it is rather shortened and it includes elements of the second part in Poco [...] Finally, <b>Excerpt</b> 10 quietly closes the movement.|$|R
