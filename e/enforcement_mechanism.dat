[...] The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The Jews were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture. [...] This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

2500|$|During {{the course}} of the Balkan Wars Bulgaria had {{captured}} {{a relatively small number of}} prisoners, therefore their internment was limited to cities. Bulgaria entered the First World War, having no previous experience of running prisoner of war camps. Arrangements were improvised on the spot, causing major logistical issues. A document titled [...] "Regulations for Prisoners of War" [...] was issued on 9 October 1915, it officially endorsed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Nevertheless many regulations were characterized by their ambiguity, thus granting the camp commanders disproportionate power in the decision making process. While the Plovdiv camp stood next to the Arda river and the weather was mild, the Haskovo lacked a supply of clean water. The reports issued by the camp commanders were filled incorrectly and rarely described humanitarian conditions. Furthermore inspections to the camps were scarce and irregular. Regulations were overhauled in 1918 when the Bulgarian government acknowledged the existence of disparities between the camps. Yet the lack of an adequate <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the hardships faced by Bulgaria during that time frame prevented them from being implemented.|$|E
40|$|The {{enforcement}} of contracts {{is necessary for}} efficient exchange and investment in economic activities.

2500|$|The main {{impediment}} to Japan's becoming {{a party to}} the convention was that it would require a change in attitude of the legal system towards child custody rights. Japanese family law considers issues of divorce custody, child support or alimony as predominantly private matters. Consequently, Japan has no <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> to enforce foreign custody rulings or recommendations made by its own domestic courts. Furthermore, Japan does not recognise joint parental authority or shared [...] "residence" [...] after divorce. [...] As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, however, Japan is supposed to recognize the right of a child to obtain non-custodial parent visitation. However, the Supreme Court of Japan has ruled before entry into force of the convention that this does not amount to the right of non-custodial parents to see their children (it has ruled that state-enforced visitation is the right of neither parent nor children). This ruling, in effect, makes visitation without the cooperation of the custody-holding parent a practical impossibility.|$|E
2500|$|One major obstacle, {{noted by}} Jeremy Morley, an {{attorney}} who had worked on parental child abduction cases in Japan, was that Japanese family law did not align to {{the parameters of the}} Hague Convention and that new legislation would need to be introduced for Japan's signature and ratification. Hans van Loon, Secretary General of the Hague Convention on Private International Law, pointed out that [...] "Japanese civil law stresses that in cases where custody cannot be reached by agreement between the parents, the Japanese Family Court will resolve the issue based on {{the best interest of the}} child. However, compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree." [...] Yuko Nishitani, an associate professor at Tohoku University and director of the Hague Academy of International Law, agreed, saying that [...] "the real reason Japan has not signed the Hague Convention is that no <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> exists in the country. Signing the convention would expose these flaws." [...] An official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, [...] "The Japanese government's position is 'not interfering in civil affairs.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Japan, CNN quoted an unnamed {{official}} in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo who stated, [...] "Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan." [...] However, this statement is contradicted by several Japanese news media sources which report arrests involving parental abduction in Japan. The Supreme Court of Japan categorically ruled that a parental abduction in which force and coercion is used to remove child constitutes the felony of kidnapping of a minor irrespective of person's custodial right. The case concerned a couple who were separated but not divorced so the abducting father held joint custody. [...] Therefore, while civil liability (or criminal liability in some countries) for parental abduction arise out of custodial interference of a parent and is not legally defined as kidnapping, in Japan, parental abduction is a kidnapping if it disrupts a child's residence or relationship with the primary caregiver. At the same time Japanese family courts have no <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> in civil matters so they strongly encourage parents to engage in mediation in order to agree to custody arrangements {{on their own and}} rarely intervene in matters such as visitation and child support which are seen as private. [...] Furthermore, it is rare for a nation to extradite one of its own citizens to another country for alleged parental abduction. On the other hand, a foreign national father, trying to re-abduct his child in Japan by force, may face arrest and possible criminal prosecution irrespective of his custodial status in the child's home country. Moreover, a foreign father trying to abduct children by force to another country would face the extra charge of [...] "kidnapping for the purpose of transporting the kidnapped person to a foreign country" [...] (Article 226(1) of the Penal Code), which carries the penalty of imprisonment with labor for a limited period of not less than two years. The law, which was originally designed as an extra penalty for the kidnapping of a minor for sexual slavery in China, is now used for preventing forced abduction from Japan by a parent. This provision of the Penal Code was amended in 2005 so that it covers kidnapping and abduction from any country, not just Japan. This means that it constitutes a criminal offence under Japanese law for a Japanese national to abduct his or her own child by force in another country and bring the child to Japan, and in such cases Japanese police and prosecutors could initiate criminal proceedings. However, this provision likely will not apply to cases where a Japanese mother who is the primary caregiver brings her children back to Japan in defiance of the custodial ruling of a foreign court, as this would not likely be seen to involve coercion or force against the child.|$|E

40|$|Governments, {{including}} tribes, need {{to protect}} one of humankind’s most valuable resources: the environment. In addition to environmental regulations, effective <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are key to successful efforts to protect the environment. While {{much has been written}} about the environmental <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of states and the federal government, little scholarly attention has been paid to how tribal governments are working to protect their environments. Given that there are 567 federally recognized tribes and approximately 56. 2 million acres held in trust for tribes in the United States, such oversight is significant. This Article fills a scholarly void with a description of environmental enforcement techniques being utilized by tribes. It builds on past articles examining tribal environmental law and also the idea of tribes, who are uniquely situated to engage in meaningful experimentation, as valuable governmental laboratories of innovation. Such consideration is constructive given that the federal government’s innovation has stagnated, and other levels of government may learn valuable lessons by reviewing the work of tribes. Further, effective enforcement of tribal environmental law may be particularly important to tribes because of the strong connection to specific areas of land that exists for many tribes and individual tribal members. To accomplish this examination of tribal environmental <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> this Article provides a descriptive survey on the environmental enforcement provisions found in the tribal code provisions of tribes located within the boundaries of four states. This Article reviews the survey results from respondents for nine tribes to determine how effective the tribes’ environmental <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been.
