Among corporations such as Amazon, Carnival & Hilton is the Venturis Corporation, who operate a number of the stations orbiting Earth.

The AI concludes that the destruction of an orbital station by [...] "accident" [...] would be their best option, with the Tacoma selected as the target. Consequently, ODIN was ordered by Venturis to stage the accident, intentionally decompressing the oxygen tanks & disabling communications. Rescue attempts were also cancelled by Venturis, ensuring {{the loss of the}} entire crew.|$|E

Early Soviet victories forced the North American government and production to flee to a Moon Base, leaving the majority of their troops behind. To counter the almost complete Soviet victory, U.N. technicians develop robots, nicknamed claws—the basic models are [...] "a churning sphere of blades and metal" [...] that ambush their unsuspecting victims [...] "spinning, creeping, shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward… warm body."

Most games cost from 20c, (rising to maximum of $10) so the stakes were correspondingly low. The service had a cap {{on the amount of}} money a player may deposit each month, so potential losses were limited. One advantage of this model was a reduced number of griefers, which Eurogamer considered to be worth the price of entry, and an over-18 age restriction limiting the amount of immature chatting. Cheating was controlled by 24-hour <b>human</b> <b>oversight</b> and compulsory anti-cheat software called 'TAC' running alongside Steams VAC2 software.

As quoted by The Intercept, TURBINE is designed to [...] "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."

50|$|The {{initial impact}} of outsourcing, and the {{relatively}} lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had {{a negative impact on}} many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers. Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected. Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the follow-the-sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations. When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have <b>human</b> <b>oversight</b> on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.|$|E
