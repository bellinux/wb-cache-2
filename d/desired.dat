5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics <b>desired.</b> With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the <b>desired</b> response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to come to a better {{understanding}} of <b>desire</b> through an examination of certain kinds of conflict of <b>desire.</b> Standard accounts of conflict of <b>desire</b> involve a two-part analysis. First, <b>desires</b> are held to conflict just in case the satisfaction of one precludes the satisfaction of the other; second, a <b>desire</b> is said to be satisfied just in case the propositional content of the <b>desire</b> is true. I argue that this account of conflict rests in an inadequate notion of <b>desire</b> satisfaction, and suggest a revision of our understanding of <b>desire</b> satisfaction to yield a better account of conflict of <b>desire.</b> This account of satisfaction requires that we recognize as a fundamental feature of <b>desire,</b> alongside the <b>desire</b> ’s strength and content, the <b>desire</b> ’s role.

In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke on subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke).

5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan.

The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the <b>desired</b> dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other.

40|$|The desire-satisfaction {{theory of}} welfare says {{that what is}} {{basically}} good for a subject is the satisfaction of his <b>desires.</b> One challenge to this view is the existence of quirky <b>desires,</b> such as a <b>desire</b> to count blades of grass. It {{is hard to see}} why anyone would <b>desire</b> such things, and thus hard to believe that the satisfaction of such <b>desires</b> could be basically good for anyone. This suggests that only some <b>desires</b> are basically good when satisfied, and that <b>desire</b> satisfactionists owe us an account of which <b>desires</b> these are, and why. In "Quirky <b>Desires</b> and Well-Being," Donald Bruckner proposes such an account: a <b>desire</b> is welfare-relevant (i. e., such that its satisfaction would be basically good for its subject) if and only if and because its subject could describe its object {{in a way that makes}} it comprehensible what about the object attracts him or appeals to him. We are inclined to view quirky <b>desires</b> as welfare-irrelevant because we assume that their objects cannot be described in such a way. But if there were a quirky <b>desire</b> whose object could be so described by the subject whose <b>desire</b> it is, then this <b>desire</b> would be relevant to that subject's welfare. I will argue that while Bruckner's view delivers plausible verdicts about the cases to which it is meant to apply, its account of what makes a <b>desire</b> welfare-relevant is unmotivated and implausible. <b>Desire</b> satisfactionists can retain what is plausible about his view while endorsing a better explanation of why welfare-relevant <b>desires</b> have that status if they accept the following account instead: a <b>desire</b> is welfare-relevant if and only if and because something about its object attracts, or appeals to, the subject who has the <b>desire...</b>|$|R

50|$|In Aristotle's De Anima {{the soul}} is seen to be {{involved}} in motion, because animals <b>desire</b> things and in their <b>desire,</b> they acquire locomotion. Aristotle argued that <b>desire</b> is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion. But Aristotle acknowledges that <b>desire</b> cannot account for all purposive movement towards a goal. He brackets the problem by positing that perhaps reason, in conjunction with <b>desire</b> and by way of the imagination, makes it possible for one to apprehend an object of <b>desire,</b> to see it as desirable. In this way reason and <b>desire</b> work together to determine what is a good object of <b>desire.</b> This resonates with <b>desire</b> in the chariots of Plato's Phaedrus, for in the Phaedrus {{the soul is}} guided by two horses, a dark horse of passion and a white horse of reason. Here passion and reason, as in Aristotle, are also together. Socrates does not suggest the dark horse be done away with, since its passions make possible a movement towards the objects of <b>desire,</b> but he qualifies <b>desire</b> and places it in a relation to reason so that the object of <b>desire</b> can be discerned correctly, so that we may have the right <b>desire.</b> Aristotle distinguishes <b>desire</b> into appetition and volition.|$|R

50|$|<b>Desire</b> is an affectively charged {{motivation}} {{toward a}} certain objects, person, or activity, {{but not limited}} to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure. <b>Desires</b> vary in strength and duration. A <b>desire</b> becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the <b>desire</b> conflicts with an individual’s values or other self-regulatory goals. A limitation to research on <b>desire</b> {{is the issue of}} individuals <b>desiring</b> different things. New research looked at what people <b>desire</b> in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of <b>desires</b> were collected and indicated significant differences in <b>desire</b> frequency and strength, degree of conflict between <b>desires</b> and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting <b>desire</b> and success of the resistance.

40|$|This paper {{defends the}} actualist desire-satisfaction theory of welfare against a popular line of objection—namely, that it cannot {{accommodate}} the fact that, sometimes, {{it is bad}} {{for a person to}} get what he wants.

40|$|Sexual <b>desire</b> {{is deeply}} {{embedded}} in interpersonal relationships and cannot be fully understood outside of this context. As such, research that focuses on sexual <b>desire</b> problems {{at the level of}} the couple is critical for more fully understanding the nature and consequences of such difficulties. In this research, I focus on one interpersonal aspect of <b>desire</b> termed sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy, or the difference between two romantic partners’ sexual <b>desire</b> levels. Given that <b>desire</b> levels tend to fluctuate over time, discrepancies in sexual <b>desire</b> are an inevitable feature of sexual relationships. However, we know little about how such <b>desire</b> discrepancies relate to sexual outcomes for couples. Past studies that have examined the association between sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction in college/university samples have had inconsistent findings. Also, the results may not generalize to more established romantic relationships. The current study compared two different conceptualizations of sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy; perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy was assessed by asking a participant to subjectively compare his/her own level of sexual <b>desire</b> to that of his/her partner. Actual <b>desire</b> discrepancy was computed by subtracting the female partner's score on a self-report measure of sexual <b>desire</b> from the male partner’s score on the same measure. In Sample 1, I examined the relationship between actual sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction for 82 couples in committed, long-term relationships. In Sample 2, I investigated the association between perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction for 191 individuals in committed, long-term relationships. Results showed that higher perceived, but not actual, <b>desire</b> discrepancy was associated with lower sexual satisfaction. Additionally, I found that perceived <b>desire</b> discrepancy outcomes differed when measured using different response scales. Findings highlight methodological issues to consider when measuring sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and extend the literature by showing that perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy is associated with sexual satisfaction for couples in committed, long-term relationships. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
