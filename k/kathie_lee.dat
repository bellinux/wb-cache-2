5|$|Promotion {{began in}} 1998, when Spears did a small tour in malls and food courts that were located mostly in larger {{cities around the}} United States and Canada. Each show lasted around thirty minutes, and Spears had two male dancers {{with her on the}} stage. The promo tour is also known as the L'Oreal Mall Tour, after its sponsor. The singer made several promotional {{appearances}} including talk shows and live performances around the world. On December 1998, Spears' first showed up on MTV's and the Box's most-requested video charts. She also appeared on the Ricki Lake Show, the Howie Mandel Show, and was the presenter of the 1999 American Music Awards, prior to the release of the album. The singer also appeared on MTV's Spring Break and on the hundredth episode of Nickelodeon's All That. However, after hurting her knee, she had rescheduled appearances several shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee.</b> After recovering, Spears embarked on another promotional schedule.

5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee.</b> They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E

25|$|The {{centerpiece}} of each Name That Tune series was an orchestra, which would play the songs for the contestants to guess. Bob Alberti was the {{conductor of the}} orchestra for the first season, with Tommy Oliver replacing him in 1975 and Stan Worth replacing Oliver in 1978. The orchestra also featured a vocalist for the show's entire run. Originally the position was held by <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford, then known as <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Johnson, who performed until 1978. She was replaced by Monica Burruss for the 1978–79 season, who remained with the series until its 1981 cancellation.|$|E
25|$|Good Morning America {{featured}} a Gilligan's Island reunion {{presided over by}} guest host <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford on November 26, 1982. The entire cast was present, save Jim Backus who was unable to attend. Backus appeared via a live video remote from Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|After Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 {{and moved}} to New York City, Philbin rejoined her on The Morning Show, on WABC-TV. At the time, the 9am time slot for WABC {{suffered}} from low Nielsen ratings because of competition from WNBC-TV's Donahue and WCBS-TV's game show block featuring The Joker's Wild and Tic Tac Dough. After Garvey left again and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Johnson (later Gifford), in June 1985, and ratings improved significantly. The show became nationally syndicated in September 1988 as Live! with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> and the success continued. The program replaced A.M. Los Angeles upon its cancellation in 1991 and was eventually picked up {{by all of the}} ABC owned-and-operated stations except for WLS in Chicago, which aired The Oprah Winfrey Show in that time slot and had done so since the show's debut as A.M. Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The First Gentleman's Cookbook, {{published}} in 1989, proved very popular, selling thousands of copies nationwide. Readers responded well to Orr's humor and celebrity contributors.

He appeared as guest on Live with Regis & <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> and other television shows to promote the book.|$|E
25|$|The title Twin Cities Live {{was first}} used from 1985 to 1991 for a {{short-lived}} morning talk show that debuted {{at a time when}} KSTP was trying to reinvent its news image. The other talk shows that air on KSTP-TV are Live with Kelly and Ryan, which has aired on KSTP since the late 1980s under prior hosts <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford and Regis Philbin.|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, Philbin {{announced}} that he was leaving Fox Sports, only returning occasionally host Crowd Goes Wild from March until its cancellation of the show on May 8, 2014. He guest hosted two episodes of The Late Late Show in January 2015. On July 9, 2015, Philbin appeared on Today with <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> and Hoda. It was {{announced that}} he was joining the program as an occasional contributor and guest host. Philbin now appears on the program roughly once a month sometimes joining Gifford as a guest host on Hoda Kotb's days off.|$|E
25|$|Philbin is also {{an author}} and singer. His two autobiographies (with {{co-author}} Bill Zehme), I'm Only One Man! (1995) and Who Wants To Be Me? (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The former book follows a year (19941995) in his life recalling his personal life, his memories with celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> among other things. The latter book {{was a response to}} the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and deals with the show and his life. In 2011, upon leaving Live!, Philbin released a memoir titled How I Got This Way.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1943, Paul and Eileen Burce {{took their}} {{daughter}} on vacation to Hollywood. There, she appeared on Janet Gaynor's radio show Hollywood Showcase: Stars over Hollywood. The {{show was a}} talent competition, and among the other contestants were <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford's mother, Joan Epstein. Powell won the competition, and soon auditioned for Louis B. Mayer at MGM, {{as well as for}} David O. Selznick. Without even taking a screen test, Powell was then signed to a seven-year contract with MGM. Within two months, Powell was loaned to United Artists for her first film, Song of the Open Road. Powell's character in Song of the Open Road was named Jane Powell, and her stage name was taken from this.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, Today was {{aired on}} 9TV (formerly called as Talk TV and Solar News Channel) from 2011 to August 2014; an edited 90-minute {{version of the}} weekday editions aired Tuesdays through Saturdays at 5:30a.m., with a two-hour {{abbreviated}} broadcast of the Friday editions airing at 10:00a.m. local time on Saturdays. Weekend Today airs Saturdays for two hours at 10:00p.m. and Sundays at 11:00p.m. local time. The local affiliate cutaways during the weather segment were removed only from the weekday editions. Today with <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> and Hoda (titled Today's Talk for the TalkTV/SNC/9TV broadcasts) aired Tuesdays to Saturdays at 3:00a.m. Both shows {{were removed from the}} schedule since then, particularly with the relaunch of 9TV as CNN Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Various groups {{support or}} embody the anti-sweatshop {{movement}} today. The National Labor Committee brought sweatshops {{into the mainstream}} media in the 1990s when it exposed the use of sweatshop and child labor to sew clothing for <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford's Wal-Mart label. United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of workers in China, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Indonesia, and Bangladesh against Wal-Mart charging the company with knowingly developing purchasing policies particularly relating to price and delivery time that are impossible to meet while following the Wal-Mart code of conduct. Labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO, have helped support the anti-sweatshop movement out of concern both {{for the welfare of}} workers in the developing world and those in the United States.|$|E
25|$|KDFW {{presently}} broadcasts 47 {{hours of}} locally produced newscasts each week (with eight hours on weekdays, and 3½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); {{in regards to}} the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the largest local newscast output among the Dallas-Fort Worth market's broadcast television stations. In addition, KDFW produces the half-hour sports highlight program Fox 4 Sports Sunday, which airs Sundays after the 9:00p.m. newscast. The station's Sunday 5:00p.m. newscast is subject to preemption and the Saturday 6:00p.m. newscast is subject to delay due to overruns by Fox Sports telecasts. KDFW is the only remaining Fox-owned station which does not run its weekday morning newscast during the 9:00a.m. hour, as it has long ceded that timeslot to Live! with Kelly and its previous incarnations (which, as Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> moved to KDFW from KTVT in September 1993).|$|E
25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E
500|$|... "The Terror of Tiny Toon" [...] {{includes}} a live-action segment starring Regis Philbin and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford of Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee.</b> The segment {{was directed by}} Donick Cary. In the sequence, Itchy, Scratchy, Bart and Lisa fall into a pot of soup that Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> are making. The soup splash was created by dropping an item into the pot, then adding the animated characters over it. The taping of this segment took longer than expected, so a broadcast of WABC-TV's Eyewitness News that was to take place (the show was {{and continues to be}} taped at the facilities of WABC in New York, where it originated in 1983) had to be moved to another studio. Jerry Springer also guest stars in the episode as himself. His lines were recorded by Julie Thacker.|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] {{was written}} by Donick Cary, Larry Doyle and David S. Cohen, and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. [...] "Terror of the Tiny Toon" [...] includes a live-action segment starring Regis Philbin and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford. Jerry Springer and Ed McMahon also appear in the episode, voicing themselves, while Robert Englund provides the voice of Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street film series. The episode also features Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series while various characters visit the talk shows Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> and The Jerry Springer Show.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after winning}} on Millionaire, Carpenter played {{himself in a}} Saturday Night Live skit. Donald Trump, played by Darrell Hammond, {{announced}} that Carpenter would be his running-mate in the presidential election. Afterward, Carpenter pretended to call his father, then shouted, [...] "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!" [...] Carpenter also appeared on Good Morning America, Oprah Winfrey Show, Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> and Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|Although some reviewers {{criticized the}} episode for its profanity and other {{material}} deemed offensive {{at the time}} of its original broadcast, several others felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was a significant improvement over the pilot, particularly for its satirical element regarding American consumerism. The episode introduced such recurring characters as Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels, Bebe Stevens and Clyde Donovan. The show's portrayal of <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford was the first time a celebrity was spoofed in South Park.|$|E
500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] is {{the third}} episode of the American {{animated}} television series South Park. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 27, 1997. In the episode, the residents of South Park excitedly prepare for a visit by celebrity <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford, whom the boys' third-grade teacher Mr. Garrison plans to assassinate because of a childhood grudge. In the meantime, Cartman becomes extremely obese after constantly eating a bodybuilding supplement called Weight Gain 4000.|$|E
500|$|... "Floyd" [...] is the [...] of {{the fourth}} season of the American {{television}} comedy series 30 Rock, and the 74th overall episode of the series. It was written by series producer Paula Pell, and directed by Millicent Shelton. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 25, 2010. Cheyenne Jackson, Kristin McGee, and Jason Sudeikis guest star in this episode, and there are cameo appearances by <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford, Lester Holt, Hoda Kotb, and Meredith Vieira.|$|E
500|$|<b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford, then a {{television}} hostess {{on the morning}} talk show Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> {{was the first of}} many celebrities to be spoofed in a South Park episode. The South Park creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] aired, the tabloid The Globe hired Suzen Johnson to film herself seducing Frank Gifford, Gifford's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the [...] "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly happens to a celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in South Park. Actress Karri Turner provided the voice of Gifford in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on South Park. Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof glass bubble. The bubble was inspired by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile during a trip to Denver, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built {{into the back of a}} modified truck, was [...] "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film Orgazmo.|$|E
500|$|South Park Elementary teacher Mr. Garrison {{announces that}} Cartman {{has won the}} school's [...] "Save Our Fragile Planet" [...] essay contest, much to the anger of his classmate Wendy Testaburger, who {{immediately}} suspects him of cheating. The rest of the town becomes a flurry of excitement upon learning celebrity television host <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford will come to South Park to present Cartman with an award on national television. Mayor McDaniels plans a big event to showcase the town, with hopes of furthering her own career. Mr. Garrison directs rehearsals for a play with the schoolchildren depicting the history of South Park, {{which is to be}} shown at the event. Mayor McDaniels is horrified, however, to learn the historically accurate play includes children playing pioneers who attack and brutally beat the students portraying Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|... "Floyd" [...] {{featured}} cameo appearances from The Today Show correspondents Meredith Vieira, Lester Holt, <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford, and Hoda Kotb. In the episode, Vieira introduces Floyd and his fiancée, Kaitlin, as finalists competing to {{have their}} wedding featured on The Today Show. In one scene, Danny runs into the writers' room where Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are. He turns on the television to see Holt who reports, [...] "We're now getting reports that the toxic leaks have created a Cloverfield type monster in the building. The monster cannot detect the smell of human skin. Anyone still inside should disrobe immediately." [...] Jack calls Liz {{into his office and}} shows her that Floyd, drunk from his dinner with her, is still in the 30 Rock building, where he is shown interrupting a segment featuring Gifford and Kotb.|$|E
500|$|Poochie {{from the}} Simpsons episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] is seen during the [...] "Terror of the Tiny Toon" [...] segment. Also, {{the title of}} the segment [...] "Terror of the Tiny Toon", is a {{reference}} of the Animated television series Tiny Toon Adventures, as well as the movie The Terror of Tiny Town. The couch gag features Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street film series and Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series. Freddy is voiced by Robert Englund, who portrayed the character in eight films. Two talk shows appear in the episode. Bart, Lisa, Itchy and Scratchy accidentally visit Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> while the Simpson family and Kang appear on The Jerry Springer Show. The title of the third segment, [...] "Starship Poopers", is a reference to the film Starship Troopers.|$|E
500|$|Cartman's {{impulse to}} buy a {{bodybuilding}} supplement based on a single commercial {{has been described as}} a satire of the concept of [...] "identity shopping". The concept involves the obtaining of an identity through what one owns, wears or buys, just as Cartman seeks to remake himself as a bodybuilder by buying Weight Gain 4000. [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] also satirizes the obsession with celebrity prevalent among most Americans, particularly through the town's overly enthusiastic reaction to <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford's appearance. Additionally, Anglican theologian Paul F. M. Zahl has suggested Cartman's addiction to food in the episode, combined with his blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 supplement and his insistence to [...] "follow your dreams", reflects the idea that many people falsely cling to the notion of free will when they in fact lack any self-control whatsoever. Zahl wrote, [...] "The two writers of South Park see through the myth of 'free will.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons segment {{was filmed}} in mid-September 2010, before the {{controversy}} began, {{and thus it}} was not inspired by the decision to cut Perry's appearance from Sesame Street. Executive producer Al Jean announced to Entertainment Weekly on September 25 that the singer would guest star on the show, commenting that [...] "In the wake of Elmo's terrible betrayal, the Simpsons puppets wish to announce they stand felt-shoulder-to-shoulder with Katy Perry." [...] The segment was shot {{in front of a}} green screen. This was the third time that a sequence of The Simpsons was shot in live-action — the first being the [...] "Homer³" [...] segment of the 1995 episode Treehouse of Horror VI in which a 3D computer-animated Homer ends up in the real-life world, and in the [...] "Terror of Tiny Town" [...] segment of Treehouse of Horror IX where Bart and Lisa appear on Live With Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Spice Girls were in Japan when [...] "Wannabe" [...] went {{to number}} one in the UK. The group made their first {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops by satellite link from Tokyo, where they used a local temple as a backdrop for their mimed performance. They have performed the song several more times on the show, including the programme's 1996 Christmas special. It was performed many times on television, in both Europe and the US, including An Audience with..., the Bravo Supershow, Sorpresa ¡Sorpresa!, Fully Booked, Live with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee,</b> The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Saturday Night Live. The performance at Saturday Night Live on 12 April 1997 was featured in the 5-part TV musical special [...] "SNL: 25 Years of Music", and {{was the first time the}} group ever performed [...] "Wannabe" [...] with a live band—their previous performances had all been either lip-synched or sung to a recorded backing track.|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee</b> Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E
500|$|Todd's {{impact is}} varied. The rape storyline {{inspired}} feminist studies, and, in 1994, OLTL was awarded several Daytime Emmys {{in writing and}} acting for all the principles involved. Michael Malone and Josh Griffith's team won an Emmy for writing, Susan Haskell won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Hillary B. Smith was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Howarth won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series. [...] In 1995, Howarth was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Soap Opera Digest (SOD) named him Outstanding Leading Actor. [...] SOD also named him Outstanding Villain in 1998. While Howarth {{has been called a}} [...] "fan favorite, {{and one of the best}} actors in soaps", Todd has been called [...] "one of the greatest characters of all-time" [...] and Howarth's portrayal of him has been called [...] "iconic". The Hollywood Reporter stated that even though Todd was a convicted rapist, he was the most popular character and Howarth was the most popular actor on OLTL. According to Waggett, the rape storyline propelled Todd [...] "onto the list of OLTL most despicable villains". [...] He said that due to the storyline and to Howarth's talent, Todd [...] "became the show's next centerpiece villain and eventually the show's male lead". [...] Howarth appeared on several interview shows following his Emmy win in 1994, including the Phil Donahue Show in May, with six other male soap stars, and later that month, on Live! with Regis and <b>Kathie</b> <b>Lee.</b> Host Regis Philbin commented on the fact that Howarth was receiving more fan mail than any other American soap opera star, and called him [...] "a terrible villain, who's become a heartthrob to thousands of wildly adoring fans".|$|E
