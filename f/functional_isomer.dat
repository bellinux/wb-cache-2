40|$|Isomaltulose, a <b>functional</b> <b>isomer</b> of sucrose, is a non-cariogenic {{reducing}} disaccharide; {{has a low}} glycemic index; selectively promotes {{growth of}} beneficial bifidobacteria in the human intestinal microflora; and has greater stability than sucrose in some foods and beverages. Isomaltulose is a nutritional sugar that is digested more slowly than sucrose, and has health advantages for diabetics and nondiabetics. Immobilization techniques, especially entrapment of the cells, are widely used for conversion of sucrose into isomaltulose. Immobilization offers advantages such as minimum downstream processing, continuous operation and reusability of cells. Isomaltulose is currently {{considered to be a}} promising sugar substitute...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{rhodopsin}} I (SR-I) and bacteriorhodopsin (BR) from Halobacterium halobium show broad {{structural and}} spectroscopic similarities and yet perform distinct functions: photosensory reception and proton pumping, respectively. Probing the photoactive sites of SR-I and BR with 24 retinal analogs reveals {{differences in the}} protein environments near the retinal 13 -methyl group and near the beta-ionone ring. 13 -cis-Retinal does not form a retinylidene pigment with the SR-I apoprotein, although this isomer binds to the BR apoprotein even more rapidly than all-trans-retinal, the <b>functional</b> <b>isomer</b> of both pigments. The activation of both SR-I and BR requires all-trans/ 13 -cis isomerization of retinal;however, a steric interaction between the retinal 13 -methyl group and the protein is required for SR-I activation but not for that of BR. These results reveal a key difference between SR-I and BR {{that is likely to}} be the initial diverging point in their photoactivation pathways. We propose the 13 -methyl group-protein interaction functions as a trigger for SR-I activation [...] i. e., converts photon absorption by the chromophore into protein conformational changes. A similar steric trigger is essential for activation of mammalian rhodopsin, indicating a common mechanism for receptor activation in archaebacterial and vertebrate retinylidene photosensors...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} structure, intramolecular interactions, second-order delocalizations, and C−N rotational {{barriers in}} aminoguanidine {{have been studied}} using ab initio MO and density <b>functional</b> methods. <b>Isomer</b> AG 1 with intramolecular hydrogen bonding {{has been found to}} be the most stable on the potential energy surface, with nine minima. The influences of the basis set, computational method, and solvent effect on relative stabilities of important isomers of aminoguanidine have been studied. Natural Population Analysis (NPA) indicates that amino substitution in guanidine leads to an increased electron delocalization from the center of the NH 2 attachment to the π frame. A strong redistribution of π electron density has been observed in aminoguanidine in relation to guanidine. The protonation energy for aminoguanidine is slightly less than that of guanidine. In protonated aminoguanidine, the π delocalization is more polarized in comparison to that in protonated guanidine. NPA, HOMA, and NICS studies have been carried out to understand electron delocalization in protonated guanidine and aminoguanidine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Certain {{metabolites}} of progesterone such as 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP; allopregnanolone) and 3 alpha, 5 beta-THP (pregnanolone) are potent, positive allosteric modulators of {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} type A receptors. Although animal studies suggest anxiolytic properties of these endogenous modulators of central nervous excitability, no clinical data indicate {{whether they are}} also involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and panic attacks. Methods: We quantified the concentrations of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP, 3 alpha, 5 beta-THP, the isomer 3 beta, 5 alpha- THP, and their precursors in the plasma of 10 patients with panic disorder and matched control subjects during panic attacks induced by means of sodium lactate and cholecystokinin tetrapeptide administration, using a highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Results: Panic attacks induced by sodium lactate and cholecystokinin tetrapeptide in patients with panic disorder were accompanied by pronounced decreases in the concentrations of 3 alpha, 5 alpha- THP and 3 alpha, 5 beta-THP and a concomitant increase in the concentrations of the <b>functional</b> antagonistic <b>isomer</b> 3 beta, 5 alpha-THP, findings that are compatible with a decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone. No changes in neuroactive steroid concentrations were observed after placebo administration in patients with panic disorder or after placebo, sodium lactate, or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide administration in controls. Conclusions: The association between changes in plasma neuroactive steroid concentrations and experimentally induced panic attacks and the well- documented pharmacological properties of these compounds as gamma-amino-butyric acid type A receptor modulators suggest that neuroactive steroids {{may play a role}} in the pathophysiology of panic attacks in patients with panic disord...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, the structure–activity {{relationship}} of nitrogenase {{is still not}} understood. Only recently was the full molecular structure of the FeMo cofactor (FeMoco) revealed, but the charge and metal oxidation states of FeMoco have been controversial. With the recent identification of the interstitial atom as a carbide and the more recent revised oxidation-state assignment of the molybdenum atom as Mo(III), here we revisit the Mössbauer properties of FeMoco. By a detailed error analysis of density <b>functional</b> theory-computed <b>isomer</b> shifts and computing isomer shifts relative to the P-cluster, we find that only the charge of [MoFe 7 S 9 C] 1 – fits the experimental data. In view of the recent Mo(III) identification, the charge of [MoFe 7 S 9 C] 1 – corresponds to a formal oxidation-state assignment of Mo(III) 3 Fe(II) 4 Fe(III), although due to spin delocalization, the physical oxidation state distribution might also be interpreted as Mo(III) 1 Fe(II) 4 Fe(2. 5) 2 Fe(III), according to a localized orbital analysis of the MS = 3 / 2 broken symmetry solution. These results can be reconciled with the recent spatially resolved anomalous dispersion study by Einsle et al. that suggests the Mo(III) 3 Fe(II) 4 Fe(III) distribution, if some spin localization (either through interactions with the protein environment or through vibronic coupling) were to take place.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the methyl group on C- 1 of Ring A of the corrin ring of vitamin B 12 was {{investigated}} by 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The proton-decoupled 13 C spectra of vitamin B 12 synthesized from [5 - 13 C]δ-aminolevulinic acid by Propionibacteria were obtained by Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance of high resolution, and spectra of high-resolution proton magnetic resonance of the 13 C-labeled B 12 were also taken. The δ-carbon atom of δ-aminolevulinic acid {{is the source of}} seven or eight known positions of vitamin B 12, depending on whether the C- 1 methyl group is also derived from the labeled substrate. We have found seven resonances whose chemical shifts enable us to identify the position of the 13 C atoms in the molecule from the assignment of Dodderell and Allerhand. We observed no 13 C resonance corresponding to the C- 1 methyl group of Ring A. Furthermore, the proton magnetic resonance spectrum showed no spin-spin splitting of the proton peak at the τ values assigned for the H atoms in this methyl group. It would thus appear that the methyl group at C- 1, which has been considered to have the same origin as the δ-methine bridge of porphyrins, does not originate from the δ-carbon atom of δ-aminolevulinic acid. This finding may aid in elucidation of the mechanism of synthesis of the <b>functional</b> <b>isomer</b> of vitamin B 12 and porphyrins. The 13 C-labeled vitamin B 12 enabled us to make further assignments to the 13 C magnetic resonance of the vitamin...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} energy surfaces of dithioformic acid and its <b>functional</b> <b>isomer,</b> dithiohydroxy carbene, in both neutral and ionized {{states have been}} investigated using ab initio molecular orbital calculations at both (U) -MP 2 and (U) QCISD(T) levels with the 6 - 31 G(d,p) and 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis sets. The unimolecular decomposition of HC(=S) SH giving H- 2 + CS 2 and H 2 S + C=S, its rearrangement to HS-C-SH, and different simple bond cleavages have been examined. In both electronic states, the carbene is a stable isomer lying in a relatively deep potential well. Formation of H 2 S via a one-step decomposition of acid {{is found to be}} favored over that of CS 2 whose reaction path involves a carbene intermediate. Carbene radical cations also participate as crucial intermediates in unimolecular transformation of ionized acids. Calculations on different hydrogen-bonded dimers of acid and carbene suggest that, in the dimer form, while the carbene is not stable, elimination of both H- 2 and H 2 S is accelerated. The role of H 2 S and H- 2 as possible catalysts in the acid decomposition has also been investigated. H 2 S induces an efficient catalytic effect in different hydrogen transfer pathways. The standard heats of formation are estimated to be Delta H(f, 298) degrees[HC(=S) SH] = 113 +/- 8 kJ/mol and Delta H(f, 298) degrees[HS-C-SH] = 267 +/- 12 kJ/mol based on CCSD(T) / 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 2 p) calculations. Adiabatic ionization energies are predicted to be IEa(HS-C-SH) = 8. 2 +/- 0. 3 eV and IEa(HC(=S) SH) ] = 9. 0 +/- 0. 3 eV, and proton affinities are PA[HC(=S) SH] = 802 +/- 12 kJ/mol and PA[HS-C-SH] = 956 +/- 12 kJ/mol. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} energy surfaces of acetyl cyanide and its <b>functional</b> <b>isomer</b> acetyl isocyanide in their electronic ground state {{have been investigated}} using ab initio molecular orbital MP 2 (FU) / 6 - 311 G** and QCISD(T) / 6 - 311 G** calculations. The molecular eliminations of CH 3 COX (X = CN,NC) to CH 3 X + CO, HX + CH 2 CO, and CH 2 + HCOX, the unimolecular rearrangements to CH 3 C-OX and CH 3 C - CX carbenes, 1, 3 -hydrogen migration to CH 2 = C(OH) X, 1, 3 -methyl migration to CH 3 NCCO, and radical decompositions to X. + CH 3 CO and CH 3. + COX have been examined. Also the secondary decomposition processes of COCN and CONC radicals in their ground states and the secondary elimination of HX from CH 2 = C(OH) X have been investigated. Cyanide-isocyanide isomerization {{is found to be}} the predominant channel in the unimolecular reactions of acetyl cyanide. Despite being exothermic, the decomposition of acetyl cyanide into CH 3 CN + CO is found to be kinetically unfavorable. Decomposition into HCN + CH 2 CO, the reverse reaction of CH 3 COCN synthesis, is found to be a preferred dissociation pathway and is expected to compete at high temperatures with the 1, 3 -hydrogen migration, yielding cyanovinyl alcohol. The barriers for the rearrangement processes to carbenes in acetyl isocyanide are quite high in contrast to those of acetaldehyde and fluoroformaldehyde. The large magnitude of the reverse barrier from the carbenes to acetyl cyanide suggests the stability of the carbenes. In the ground state of CH 3 COX, the CH 3 -C bond cleavage is found to be more facile compared to the C(O) -X bond cleavage. The secondary dissociation from CONC requires a rather small barrier, and both cyanide and isocyanide forms are found to have very similar {{potential energy}} surface. status: publishe...|$|E
