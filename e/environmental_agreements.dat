Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity. Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of [...] "resource wars".

500|$|On January 4, 2007, Baird was {{appointed}} as Environment Minister in a cabinet shuffle, replacing Rona Ambrose. In making the appointment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government {{needed to do}} more to make the environment a priority. Some commentators remarked favourably on Baird's appointment, describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator. Columnist Andrew Coyne, however, described Baird as [...] "the man sent to kill the issue," [...] suggesting that Baird's appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms. Baird is a vocal opponent of the Kyoto Protocol, which he argues will bring about an [...] "economic collapse". Later in 2007, he added that any new <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as China, India and the United States who have not signed the Protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the Protocol. Baird met with renowned Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki following his appointment. At the time Suzuki said he was encouraged by Baird's approach, but remained skeptical of the Harper government's environmental plans. However, when Baird unveiled the Conservative government's plan in April 2007, Suzuki confronted him, calling the plan [...] "a disappointment".|$|E

[...] International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s.

Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues. [...] Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{legally binding}} {{international}} agreements encompass {{a wide variety}} of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection. International <b>environmental</b> <b>agreements</b> are generally multilateral (or sometimes bilateral) treaties (a.k.a. convention, agreement, protocol, etc.). Protocols are subsidiary agreements built from a primary treaty. They exist in many areas of international law but are especially useful in the environmental field, where they may be used to regularly incorporate recent scientific knowledge. They also permit countries to reach agreement on a framework that would be contentious if every detail were to be agreed upon in advance. [...] The most widely known protocol in international environmental law is the Kyoto Protocol, which followed from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> {{voluntary}} <b>agreements</b> with {{industries are}} becoming a popular alternative to traditional regulation. One {{reason may be that}} such agreements increase implementation cost efficiency. On the other hand, models of the political economy of <b>environmental</b> voluntary <b>agreements</b> point out that efficiency reducing agreements are also possible under certain conditions. In this paper we interpret empirical evidence from case studies of <b>environmental</b> voluntary <b>agreements</b> using one such policy formulation and implementation model. When our sample is interpreted in this light the data suggests that <b>environmental</b> voluntary <b>agreements</b> may often be chosen in order to shift the responsibility for implementation to industrial organizations that are less sensitive to criticism from powerful environmental interest groups. When this explanation of an <b>environmental</b> voluntary <b>agreement</b> applies, the model predicts that the agreement will be less cost effective and achieve lower environmental performance than the traditional regulatory alternative which would otherwise have been adopted. Although our findings are not conclusive nor necessarily representative they do suggest the worrying possibility that many of the <b>environmental</b> voluntary <b>agreements</b> being established today achieve lower environmental performance less cost effectively than the most likely traditional regulatory alternative. ...|$|R
