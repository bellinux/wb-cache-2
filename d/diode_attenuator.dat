40|$|A novel linearisation {{technique}} for {{reduction in the}} first and second kind of the third-order intermodulation products was applied in this paper. The second harmonics and second-order intermodulation products are led from the output to the input of a power amplifier through a feedback loop. The power amplifier including the feedback loop components (bandpass filter, phase shifter and attenuator) was designed as a hybrid microwave integrated circuit by using program ADS. The phase and amplitude of the loop signals are the adjustable parameters. Therefore, a voltage that controls a phase shift of the phase shifter and a control current of a PIN <b>diode</b> in the <b>attenuator</b> circuit were optimised to obtain a reduction in the third-order intermodulation distortion. For three fundamental signals at the power amplifier input, the lowest improvement of 13 dB for the first and 18 dB for the second kind of the third order intermodulation product levels was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Wireless ATM plays a {{key role}} in the {{realization}} of broadband wireless networks. The transmission of various classes of traffic and the provision of bandwidth on demand over a wireless channel poses a number of new technical challenges. This thesis addresses the design of a low cost adaptive transmitter for fixed wireless ATM/B-ISDN systems with emphasis on optimum use of wireless network resources. A new architecture for a direct microwave wireless ATM transmitter is proposed. The transmitter capacity adaptation is implemented by using an admission control metric and an M-QAM modulator. The two main components of the transmitter are: an M-QAM control unit and a direct microwave QAM modulator unit. The M-QAM control unit is used to select an optimum modulation level for the QAM modulator. The modulation level is adjusted based on the bandwidth demand, QoS requirements, and outage conditions of the wireless ATM link. The direct microwave QAM modulator unit transforms the broadband traffic to a modulated microwave signal that is suitable for transmission over a wireless network. The required bandwidth of the broadband traffic is estimated using an effective bandwidth metric. An analytical relation, called the capacity reduction factor, is derived to represent the performance degradation due to the wireless channel and channel fading in a B-ISDN network. Using the effective bandwidth metric and the capacity reduction factor, a QoS metric for the wireless broadband network is introduced. This metric is termed as, modified effective bandwidth. This metric is used to adapt the M-QAM modulator. Another significant contribution of this research work is a new architecture for the direct QAM modulator. This is based on use of PIN <b>diode</b> reflection <b>attenuators.</b> The PIN <b>diodes</b> operate in forward bias condition thereby overcoming the speed limitation problem due to charge storage. Using residue theory, analytical results to model the large signal forward bias operation of PIN diodes are presented. This theory also examines the transition time of a PIN diode with bias changes from a reverse bias to a forward bias. The direct microwave QAM modulator implementation using MIC and silicon MMIC technologies is examined. While a realization using MIC is simple and straightforward, a silicon MMIC realization offers a very cost effective solution. A system study was conducted to examine the operation of the adaptive direct microwave M-QAM modulator in the wireless channel with ATM traffic. The operation has been examined for different wireless channels and for various classes of traffic. The call acceptance and outage performance are compared with those for a fixed QAM modulator. The results show that the proposed system can be used for implementation of cost effective adaptive transmitters for broadband wireless applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a rain fade simulation/counteraction system on a laboratory simulated 30 / 20 GHz, time division multiple access (TDMA) satellite communications testbed is evaluated. Severe rain attenuation of electromagnetic radiation at 30 / 20 GHz occurs due to the carrier wavelength approaching the water droplet size. Rain in the downlink path lowers the signal power present at the receiver, resulting in a higher number of bit errors induced in the digital ground terminal. The laboratory simulation performed at NASA Lewis Research Center uses a programmable PIN <b>diode</b> <b>attenuator</b> to simulate 20 GHz satellite downlink geographic rain fade profiles. A computer based network control system monitors the downlink power and informs the network of any power threshold violations, which then prompts the network to issue commands that temporarily increase the gain of the satellite based traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifier. After the rain subsides, the network returns the TWT to the normal energy conserving power mode. Bit error rate (BER) data taken at the receiving ground terminal serves {{as a measure of}} the severity of rain degradation, and also evaluates {{the extent to which the}} network can improve the faded channel...|$|E
40|$|Variable attenuators are {{important}} circuits {{that can be}} employed in many radio frequency (RF) applications, e. g., in automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, broadband gain-control blocks at RF frequencies or as broadband vector modulators. For any applications, low insertion phase shift and low power consumption are of interest. A way to implement variable attenuators is using the RF PIN diode. The PIN diode {{is characterized by a}} low doped (I = intrinsic) semiconductor region between p- (P) and n-type (N) semiconductor regions. Besides the variable attenuators, the PIN-diode is used in other RF circuits, such as RF switches, limiters and phase shifters. This project presents the design of variable attenuators at 7. 5 GHz and 500 MHz frequency bandwidth for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications using two different PIN <b>diodes.</b> The variable <b>attenuators</b> have a topology based on 90 ° hybrid couplers. The design is performed using Advance Design Systems (ADS) from Agilent Technologies Inc. After presenting the PIN diode and its equivalent circuit, the theory of the 90 ° passive directional branch line coupler and the operation principle of the variable attenuators are presented. As the selection of the appropriate PIN diode is a critical step in the design, special attention is dedicated to this aspect. It follows the design of the variable attenuators with extensive descriptions of the simulations in ADS. Firstly, both series and shunt attenuators are presented. However, as these circuits normally offer narrow band variable attenuation, the 900 directional branch line coupler is used in the attenuator for broader band operation. At the end, a double hybrid coupler is found to eliminate the ripple in the high attenuation state of the single hybrid coupled attenuator. So the final topology of the variable attenuator is a double hybrid coupler variable attenuator- Moreover, in this project, different PIN diodes are investigated for variable attenuator applications. Different manufacture companies are currently providing different kinds of PIN diodes in terms of parameters and packages. Every type of PIN diodes are providing different sort of advantages to the designers. That is why it has become more difficult for the RF designers to choose the right device for the specified application. Beside the design of the variable <b>attenuator</b> using PIN <b>diodes,</b> some considerations in form of a guide line to the designers while they are using the PIN diode for designing the variable attenuator. In this work, the used PIN diodes are a beam lead PIN diode and chip PIN diode. The beam lead PIN diode is used because it is manufactured for high frequency and it produces excellent electrical performance and isolation at high frequencies. On the other hand, the chip PIN diode eliminates the problem of package parasitics. However, printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing limitations at the university laboratory incline the balance in the favor of the beam lead PIN diode, HPND- 4005 from Avagotech, instead of the also considered chip diode MA-COM MA 4 P 202...|$|R
