5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; {{it is one of the}} axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan {{hard to believe}} and started to read the Naruto manga {{in order to see}} if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> he revisited the series.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that we previously performed an extensive study {{to evaluate the}} application of Granger Causality Test on software defects prediction (Couto et al. 2014). Basically, we focus on answering questions such as: (a) <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> series pass the preconditions related to defects (preconditions P 1, P 2, P 3)? (b) <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>time</b> series pass the preconditions related to source code metrics (preconditions P 4 and P 5)? (c) <b>How</b> <b>many</b> classes present positive results on the Granger Test? (d) What {{is the number of}} defects potentially covered by Granger? To answer these questions, we used a dataset including time series of source code metrics and defects for four real-world systems (Eclipse JDT Core, Eclipse PDE UI, Equinox Framework, and Lucene) (Couto et al. 2013 b).|$|R

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E
