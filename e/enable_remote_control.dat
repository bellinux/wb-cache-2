The user interfaces {{can be used}} to remotely control, monitor and debug embedded systems using a standard Web Browser. The proposed architecture takes advantage of the distributed nature of the Internet to store all static user interface data and software on third-party Web services (the Cloud), and execute the user-interface code on the user’s Web Browser. A simplified protocol is proposed to <b>enable</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control,</b> status-monitoring, debugging and step-by-step execution, minimizing resource consumption on the physical embedded devices, including processing load, memory and communication bandwidth. As the user interface data and code are kept on third-party Web services, these resources can be shared among multiple embedded device units, and the hardware requirements to implement the devices can be simplified, leading to reduced cost solutions. To prevent down-time due to network problems or server failures, a fault-tolerant topology is suggested. The distributed architecture is transparent to end-users, observing just a Web interface for an embedded device {{on the other side of}} an Internet URL...|$|E
40|$|The new LINAC 4 will {{accelerate}} H^{−} ions to 160 MeV {{and ultimately}} replace the existing 50 MeV LINAC 2 in the injector chain for the LHC upgrade. During commissioning in 2013, a laserwire scanner and diamond strip detector were installed for non-invasive emittance {{measurements of the}} 3 MeV H^{−} beam. Synergy with the 3 MeV H^{−} Front End Test Stand at RAL, has stimulated collaborative development of a novel laserwire system. A low peak power (8 kW) pulsed laser is fibre-coupled for remote installation and alignment free operation.

40|$|Homes with {{integrated}} {{state of}} the art technology are considered Smart Homes. A smart home has special systems which <b>enable</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> via remote computer or smart phones. These modern integrated services are supported by electrical power infrastructures called Smart Grids, which provides a stable electrical power environment to support all functionalities, with intelligent power systems that provide increased power quality. Inside a Smart home, a legacy metering system called Smart Meters are installed offering new functionalities such as remote readings of power consumption, and different time usage of tariffs. Preliminary research has already indicated vulnerability attacks on smart meters which affect the security and privacy in smart meters. Security issues in this system include vulnerabilities and privacy issues includes information leakage in real-time consumption data that is recorded by the smart meters. Enhancing both security and privacy in the smart meters are the main purpose of this thesis. The principle goal of this research is to provide more understanding about the smart meters from a security and privacy perspective. This thesis investigates issues and problems in smart meters and proposes a secure communication protocol in the application layer, in addition to a proof-of-concept of the final solution. In this research we introduce the solution by means of two scenarios, we highlight the effects of an attack on the smart meters on levels of simulation and theory. The first scenario is to "take control over the smart meter to access the data consumptions in the smart meters". The proposed solution of using the Smart Phone as a third part to protect the smart meters has been evaluated using a network simulation tool. The result shows that the data captured by attacking node is encrypted and can't be used for any useful operation. In the second scenario, "monitoring the data consumptions to harm the user's privacy", in other words, stealing the user's devices. The proposed solution is using the home electrical power routing to moderate the home's load signature in order to hide appliance usage information. Data clusters are implemented as a proof of concept to evaluate the data. The results show that there is only 99. 5 % correct clustered data with good quality...|$|E

This is due to the cost associated in shielding wires to prevent severe conditions which are usually present in these harsh environments (high humidity, high temperature, strong vibration, etc.)[9].

30|$|A testbed for {{evaluating}} if and how process-aware monitoring {{may increase the}} security of decentralized SCADA networks in power grids is presented. The testbed builds on the co-simulation framework Mosaik, and co-simulates in an integrated way, the power distribution network on different voltage levels, {{as well as the}} control network (Modbus/TCP). The existing simulators were extended to allow topology changes, and a controller (RTU) simulator connected to a SCADA server <b>enabling</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> was implemented.

Furthermore, it is shown that unsafe transformer tap positions can also be avoided. To illustrate the relevance and importance of the proposed testbed, a detailed comparison of related work on process-aware intrusion detection approaches and testbeds combining (parts of) the control network and the power grid is provided.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} stimulate select neurons in {{isolated}} tissue and in living animals {{is important for}} investigating their role in circuits and behavior. We show that the engineered light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR), when introduced into neurons, <b>enables</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of their activity. Trains of action potentials are optimally evoked and extinguished by 380 nm and 500 nm light, respectively, while intermediate wavelengths provide graded control over the amplitude of depolarization. Light pulses of 1 – 5 ms in duration at 380 nm trigger precisely timed action potentials and EPSP-like responses or can evoke sustained depolarizations that persist for minutes in the dark until extinguished by a short pulse of 500 nm light. When introduced into sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae, activation of LiGluR reversibly blocks the escape response to touch.

40|$|The {{selection}} {{and analysis of}} detector events of the heavy ion collider experiment ALICE at CERN are accomplished by the so-called trigger levels. The High Level Trigger (HLT) is the last trigger level of this experiment. Currently, it consists of up to over 120 computers and it is planned to upgrade the cluster to up to 300 computers. However, the manual installation, configuration and maintenance of such a big computer farm require {{a large amount of}} administrative effort.
