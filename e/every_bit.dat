25|$|Because the P-array is 576 bits long, {{and the key}} bytes are XORed {{through all}} these 576 bits during the initialization, many {{implementations}} support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of every subkey depends on <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of the key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.|$|E

50|$|Only a {{small amount}} of {{cryptanalysis}} has been published on NewDES. The designer showed that NewDES exhibits the full avalanche effect after seven rounds: <b>every</b> ciphertext <b>bit</b> depends on <b>every</b> plaintext <b>bit</b> and key bit.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} 01 and 10 {{preambles}} guarantees a <b>bit</b> transition <b>every</b> 66 <b>bits,</b> {{which means}} that a continuous stream of 0s or 1s cannot be valid data. It also allows easier clock/timer synchronization, as a transition must be seen <b>every</b> 66 <b>bits.</b>|$|R

The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason Jacob Fortling. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.|$|E
25|$|Henry Foster – One of Lenina's many lovers, he is a {{perfectly}} conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers.

25|$|For example, {{a common}} attack on {{asymmetric}} RSA {{relies on the}} fact that the encryption steps rely on the value of the key bits. <b>Every</b> <b>bit</b> is processed with a square operation and then a multiplication operation if and only if the bit is equal to 1. An attacker with a clear trace can deduce the key simply by observing where the multiplication operations are performed.|$|E

50|$|Consider a 1/2 {{convolutional}} coder, which generates 2 bits (00, 01, 10 or 11) for <b>every</b> input <b>bit</b> (1 or 0). These Return-to-Zero {{signals are}} {{translated into a}} Non-Return-to-Zero form shown alongside.|$|R
25|$|Typical {{algorithms}} {{that are}} exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC1 matrix determinant calculation does), non-classical processing (as Grover's search does), or alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do). However, formal languages {{such as the}} set of all strings that have a 1-bit in the position indicated by the first log(n) bits of the string may depend on <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of the input and yet be computable in sub-linear time.|$|E
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word and bit. Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one bit at a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> in a word to be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing. In any case, both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either NOR or NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|Miller, in one {{spirited}} over, {{altered the}} whole {{course of the}} game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton with his legs {{in front of the}} wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well {{under the control of the}} batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account. Miller deserved <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of the thunderous applause which the big crowd handed him when the over was completed.|$|E

For example, specification for an enterprise SAS disk (a model from 2013) estimates this fraction to be one uncorrected error in <b>every</b> 1016 <b>bits,</b> and another SAS enterprise disk from 2013 specifies similar error rates. Another modern (as of 2013) enterprise SATA disk specifies an error rate of less than 10 non-recoverable read errors in <b>every</b> 1016 <b>bits.</b> An enterprise disk with a Fibre Channel interface, which uses 520 byte sectors to support the Data Integrity Field standard to combat data corruption, specifies similar error rates in 2005.|$|R

25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed {{a group of kids}} trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} churches and other {{buildings}} in rural {{parts of the}} state are noted for their “folk baroque” architecture and decoration, especially in Atlixco and the southwest. Folk baroque consists of the use of tile and painted raised stucco based on more traditional Baroque designs, which was most popular in the 18th century. One well known church of this type is the church of Jolapan, which is modeled after the Tepalcingo Sanctuary in neighboring Morelos. The church of Jolalpan contains richly decorated pilasters, Solomonic columns and other elements in a design very similar to that of Tepalcingo. Between these {{there are a number of}} small churches which also show folk baroque influence such as those in Tlancualpican and Tzicatlán. The church in Tlancualpican is painted in bright blues, greens and red, with an ornate façade with sculpted leaves, tendrils and niches divided by spiral half-columns all done in stucco. Even more ornate is the church in Tzicatlán, which is a small rural farming village, with <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of the surface of the main façade decorated with brightly colored images and sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. <b>Every</b> <b>bit</b> of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E
