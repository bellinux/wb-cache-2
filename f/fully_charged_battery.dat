25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>battery</b> or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{concerns}} {{reported by}} those {{participating in the}} U.S. {{during the first year}} trial were range anxiety and lack of public charging infrastructure, as the country had only 734 public charging stations, most located in California.

5000|$|When not in use, [...] {{batteries}} are typically kept molten {{and ready for}} use because if allowed to solidify they typically take 12 hours to reheat and charge.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the business case of offering secondary downward reserve for frequency {{control on the}} German market by a pool of electrical vehicles. Former benchmark studies promised high revenues especially for this case. The benefits could provide an incentive to customers to buy an electric vehicle. The business case is analyzed for the German market as a case study. Specific regulations for this market, real driving patterns and real market data {{are taken into account}} when calculating revenues. Secondary reserve is strictly regulated, requiring a very high level of availability. As a result, simulated revenues are lower than assumed. Simulation shows average revenues of less than 5 € per month and vehicle. As a major bottleneck for an offer of secondary reserve, <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>batteries</b> are identified. Additionally an issue is made of costs for communication and customer compensation. Based on the simulation results, it is argued that the market for secondary reserve should not be accessed with these small units. For electric vehicles, easier accessible markets with lower related costs should be considered instead. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The areal {{capacity}} {{ratio of}} negative to positive electrodes (N/P ratio) {{is the most}} important factor to design the lithium ion batteries with high performance in the consideration of balanced electrochemical reactions. In this study, the effect of N/P ratio (1. 10, 1. 20, and 1. 30) on electrochemical properties has been investigated with a lithium polymer battery with PVdF-coated separator and 1. 40 Ah of capacity. The N/P ratio is controlled by adjusting the anode thickness with a fixed anode density. The cell with an N/P ratio higher than 1. 10 effectively suppresses the lithium plating at the 0. 85 C-rate charging at 25 °C and the cell with 1. 20 of N/P ratio shows the enhanced cycle performance in comparison with other cells. Among the cells with differently designed N/P ratios, significant difference was not observed in the aging test with <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> <b>batteries</b> at 25 and 45 °C. The effect of N/P ratio on electrochemical properties of lithium batteries can help to design the safe full cell without lithium plating. clos...|$|R
