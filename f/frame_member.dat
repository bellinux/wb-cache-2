25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E
2500|$|Cristofori's pianos use an {{internal}} <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> (bentside) {{to support the}} soundboard; in other words, the structural member attaching {{the right side of}} the soundboard is distinct from the external case that bears the tension of the strings. This system was also applied by Cristofori to harpsichords. The use of a separate support for the soundboard reflects Cristofori's belief that the soundboard should not be subjected to compression from string tension. This may improve the sound, and also avoids the peril of warping—as harpsichord makers Kerstin Schwarz and Tony Chinnery point out , , a severely warped soundboard threatens a structural catastrophe, namely contact between strings and soundboard. Cristofori's principle continues to be applied in modern pianos, where the now-enormous string tension (up to 20 tons) is borne by a separate iron frame (the [...] "plate").|$|E
2500|$|Like some Zöglings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending {{under the}} wing at a forward leaning {{vertical}} knife edge around the aft central wing strut, enclosing both the pilot's seat {{and the other}} supporting struts. [...] Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical <b>frame</b> <b>member.</b> The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeep box-type beams, {{consisting}} of <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, {{are sensitive to}} shear deformations and hence appropriate refined theories or complicated magnification factors are needed {{to be used to}} obtain accurate results. For sheathings or webs between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> that are weak in shear, additional shear deformations occur corresponding to the relative axial displacement between the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> These sandwich -type or partial interaction-type of in-plane shear behaviour between the <b>framing</b> <b>members,</b> needs to be taken into account, especially when the web shear stiffness is very low. The composite box-type beam treated here is composed of three <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> with sheathings on both sides. To incorporate effects of the sheathings shear deformations between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> on the deflection, the sheathings, here called web interlayers, are modelled as shear media with equivalent slip moduli corresponding to a partially interacting composite beam model. Governing equilibrium equations of the model are obtained using the minimum total potential energy principle and solved explicitly. The obtained results are compared with those based on different conventional beam theories and 3 -D finite element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the model is capable of predicting accurately the deflection {{for a wide range of}} geometry and property parameters. It is demonstrated that the deflection of such deep box-type beams can be expressed as the summation of three different effects, namely bending deformations, conventional shear deformations in the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, and additional in-plane shear deformations or shear slips of the weak web causing relative axial displacements between the <b>framing</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} counterbore the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) or so {{from the edge of}} the <b>frame</b> <b>member.</b> The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E
2500|$|The Poppenhausen had a light nacelle {{fuselage}} extending {{well behind}} the wing trailing edge and ending at a forward leaning vertical knife edge.The forward cockpit was largely {{ahead of the}} leading edge and the rear one under the wing. Behind the wing the fuselage had the same flat, cross braced girder form as the Hols der Teufel, with a horizontal upper beam, its [...] first diagonal brace within the nacelle. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} horizontal beam, its leading edge straight and strongly swept. Cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames.

2500|$|The Type L did {{not have}} a long, {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead the empennage was supported on an open girder. [...] The Type L, unusually for Caudron, had two parallel sided, cross braced side frames. The longitudinal members were steel and the cross-members ash. [...] The side frames began from the rear spars of both upper and lower wings and converged rearwards to meet at the tail, with upper and lower cross-members towards the rear. [...] A short nacelle on the lower wing contained an open, wide cockpit with side-by-side seating, the pilot on the right. [...] Controls were conventional. [...] The nacelle ended behind the forward wing spar, ahead of the [...] Gnome Delta nine cylinder rotary engine mounted on the rear interplane struts and driving a two blade propeller via 2:1 reduction gearing and a long shaft to clear the trailing edge. At the extreme tail, the final vertical <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> served as the axis for the rudder, with a small, roughly triangular fin ahead of it. The elevator hinge was also mounted high on this member, with a straight edged tailplane ahead of it.|$|E

50|$|The display {{consists}} of an LED display apparatus including multiple LED display modules, an inner <b>frame</b> <b>member,</b> and a supporting unit. The LED display module has an array of light emitting diodes mounted thereon, and a longitudinal axis. The inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> is disposed to confine the LED display module therein, and has a size sufficient to permit movement of the LED display module in opposite directions of the longitudinal axis. The supporting unit mounts the LED display module in the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> such that the LED display module is movable {{back and forth in}} the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> along the longitudinal axis.

50|$|Resistance to {{lateral forces}} is {{provided}} primarily by rigid frame action - that is, {{by the development}} of bending moment and shear force in the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> and joints. By virtue of the rigid beam-column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection. The bending rigidity and strength of the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{nonlinear}} hardening {{rule that}} describes a general yield surface change for <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is proposed. The rule is valid for homogeneous materials and {{is defined by}} a nonlinear constitutive model. The model is given as the stress–strain relationship through the section thickness. The post-yield behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is assessed using a hardening index parameter, a plastic strain coefficient, and a smooth and optimal mathematical function to model the geometry of structural wide-flange and tube sections. This enables a continuous distribution of post-yield curvatures to exist along the member length and results in accurate finite-element member displacement predictions. Steady-state hysteresis responses are determined for frame sections using the model’s nonlinearly degrading stiffness. The hardening rule is used to model the detailed material behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> that are subjected to lateral loads. The results of the model are validated through experimental published literature...|$|R

50|$|An {{improved}} exercising {{device for}} exercising {{the legs of}} a user includes a <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> with a lever arm having one end pivotably attached thereto. The lever arm extends downwardly from {{the portion of the}} <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> to which it is pivotably connected, and a pair of foot-engaging force transferring members are mounted on {{the lower end of the}} lever arm. A cable has one end pivotably connected near the lower end of the lever arm, passes around an eccentrically mounted pulley and has its other end connected to weights. As the user lifts the lower portions of his legs, the lever arm is pivoted to pull the cable and the weights attached thereto, thereby strengthening the knee muscles of the user. The eccentrically mounted pulley varies the resistance to movement of the user's lower legs initially increasing the resistance and then decreasing the resistance in a sinusoidal manner as the lower legs are lifted to pivot the lever arm and lift the weights.

50|$|In {{only one}} {{significant}} respect does the underbone {{differ from the}} conventional motorcycle - there is no <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> or fuel tank between the seat base and the headstock. Generally the fuel tank is under the riders seat. The underbone arrangement improves ease of mounting and dismounting and contributes to the cross-gender appeal of the layout as an around-town shopping and commuter vehicle. The engine size of a typical underbone is generally between 50 cc and up to about 150 cc, though much bigger ones are available.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame members}} are {{generally}} made from plain rectangular stock but are often visually enhanced {{through the application}} of cock beading or applied mouldings. Typically a <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> will be between 25mm to 50mm in width, depending upon the application and the desired appearance of the cabinet. For built in cabinets, it is common for stiles that are to abut a wall to be cut wider than the final size so that these may be scribed to the shape of the wall. This compensates for out of plumb or uneven walls, which are common in many houses.|$|E

30|$|Generated plastic hinges is {{indicated}} in Fig.  19. As {{shown in this}} figure, the off-diagonal system has {{the highest level of}} deformation not only in RC <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> but also in steel members, especially in third member of steel ODBS. The rotational capacity is increased in ODBS, the most ductile system. Performance levels of flexural and X-braced frames are limited to Life Safety (LS) level, but for ODBS, level of performance has been extended to higher ductility about related design criteria. Six and fifteen stories flexural frames have plastic hinges more than X-braced frame. On the other hand in ODBS, more members are contributed in absorption of defined existing energy by nonlinear ductile behavior of plastic rotation and deformation proportional to flexural frame. Non-linear static analyses as well as dynamic step by step seismic analyses are performed and special purpose elements are employed for the needs of this study.
