40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma is a {{vascular}} tumour of the skin, most frequently seen in men over 50 years of age, of long-term progress and low mortality. It {{is related to}} the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); it appears in the advanced stages of the disease and with immunosuppression, affecting approximately 20 % of the people with HIV who do not take antiretroviral drugs. This is a case of an urban female patient who did not have a history of disease and who began to have <b>squamous</b> <b>erythematous</b> <b>lesions</b> on the right foot and on the thighs. A skin biopsy was performed and the patient was diagnosed with a Kaposi’s sarcoma. The patient was HIV-negative.

40|$|Although tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonists {{are shown}} {{to be effective in}} the treatment of psoriasis, induction of psoriatic skin lesions have been seen in patients with different rheumatic conditions who were treated with TNF-α antagonists. In this case series, we report four cases that developed psoriatic lesions; in one of the cases, psoriasis was associated with two different TNF-α antagonists. Case 1 : A 31 -year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis developed <b>erythematous</b> and <b>squamous</b> <b>lesions</b> on his extremities in the 2 nd week of infliximab treatment. Two months later he began to receive etanercept, and psoriatic skin lesions developed on the entire trunk and extremities, and predominantly on the scalp after one month. Case 2 : A 53 -year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis developed psoriatic skin lesions in the ankle region after two months’ treatment with etanercept. Case 3 : A 34 -year-old female with ankylosing spondylitis developed psoriatic lesions on her palms after 10 months’ treatment with infliximab. Case 4 : A 40 -year-old female with ankylosing spondylitis developed pustular lesions on her palms and soles after two years’ treatment with infliximab. The patients had no personal or family history of psoriasis. The diagnosis of psoriasis was confirmed by skin biopsy in three of the cases. Psoriatic skin lesions can be induced as a result of treatment with TNF-α antagonists in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies.

40|$|Background : Dermatopathologists {{base their}} {{diagnostic}} approach on the tissue reaction pattern. This study mainly includes {{the interpretation of}} two major tissue reaction patterns, the psoriasiform and the lichenoid reactions, with clinicopathological correlation. Aims : To analyze the spectrum of non-infectious <b>erythematous</b> papular and <b>squamous</b> <b>lesions</b> of the skin at our institute, study the age, sex and anatomic distribution pattern and classify the lesions into major categories; determine the incidence of each subcategory. Materials and Methods : Study period: two years; prospective, sample size: 161 cases, proforma filled. Results : The lesions comprised 15. 80 &#x 0025; of the total load of surgical pathology and 30. 99 &#x 0025; of total number of skin biopsies. The highest percentage was in the 30 - 40 year age group (28. 6 &#x 0025;) with a male preponderance of 60. 25 &#x 0025;. The extremities were most frequently involved (67. 79 &#x 0025;). Lichenoid lesions were the commonest (46. 57 &#x 0025;) with lichen planus 26. 7 &#x 0025; and psoriasis vulgaris- 19. 88 &#x 0025; being the most frequent. There were 5. 6 &#x 0025; seropositive cases. Correlation with the histopathological diagnosis was positive in 97. 52 &#x 0025; cases and negative in 2. 48 &#x 0025; cases.

40|$|Certain {{types of}} human papillomaviruses (HPV) are {{associated}} with <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesions</b> and cancer and these are termed high-risk.

Because of the high rate of spontaneous regression of low-grade <b>squamous</b> <b>lesions,</b> follow-up by cytology, colposcopy and possible biopsy appears preferable. Due to the higher rate of progression to malignancy of the high-grade lesions conservative treatment is recommended. One of the most common reasons for persistence relates to the human immunodeficiency virus. Adenocarcinoma in situ is an uncommon disorder and not well identified by cytologic sampling or colposcopic inspection. The diagnosis is made by cone biopsy, the specimen having negative margins for disease. Hysterectomy is the treatment procedure of choice unless fertility is an issue.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Findings {{from studies}} that {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} antiretroviral drug use {{on the development of}} cervical <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> differed in their conclusions. This study investigated the association between HIV infection, antiretroviral drug use and cervical <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> in a high HIV and cervical cancer burden setting- Nigeria. METHODS: A cross sectional study among 1140 women of known HIV status enrolled in a randomised study to determine the test characteristics of visual inspection in detecting cytology diagnosed <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion.</b> Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association between HIV infection, antiretroviral drug use and the twin outcome variables of cervical <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> (SIL) and High grade <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> (HSIL) while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Prevalence of cervical <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> was 8. 5 %, with a higher prevalence of 14. 3 % in HIV positive compared to 3. 3 % in HIV negative women (aOR: 5. 4; 95 % CI: 2. 9 - 8. 8). Not using antiretroviral drugs was found to be associated with an increased risk of SIL (aOR: 2. 1; 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 3. 5) and HSIL (aOR: 2. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 6. 4). Participants who had a CD 4 cell count < 200 cells/mm 3, were also found to be at increased risk for SIL (aOR: 1. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 5. 9) and HSIL (aOR: 5. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 7. 2). CONCLUSION: HIV infection and severe immunosuppression were found to be associated with increased risk of cervical <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> but not viral load. For the first time, in the West African sub-region with specific HIV type and strains, we established the protective effect of antiretroviral drug use against the development of SIL. Integration of cervical cancer screening programme into HIV services and early initiation of antiretroviral drug in HIV positive women especially those with severe immune-suppression could therefore prove to be useful in preventing and controlling cervical cancer development in HIV positive women...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the risk of {{abnormal}} anal cytology in women with known genital <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion.</b> This study evaluated 200 women with and without genital <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> who were recruited for anal Pap smears. Women who had abnormal results on equally or over atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance were classified as having abnormal anal cytology. A multiple logistic regression analysis (stepwise) was performed to identify the risk for developing abnormal anal cytology. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 20. 0 program. The average age was 41. 09 (± 12. 64). Of the total participants, 75. 5 % did not practice anal sex, 91 % did not have HPV-infected partners, 92 % did not have any anal pathology, and 68. 5 % did not have anal bleeding. More than half (57. 5 %) had genital SIL and a significant number developed abnormal anal cytology: 13 % in the total sample and 17. 4 % in women with genital SIL. A significant association was observed between genital <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> and anal <b>squamous</b> intraepithelial <b>lesion</b> (PR= 2. 46; p= 0. 03). In the logistic regression model, women having genital intraepithelial lesion were more likely to have abnormal anal Pap smear (aPR= 2. 81; p= 0. 02).
