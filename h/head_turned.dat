5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her <b>head</b> <b>turned</b> to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his <b>head</b> <b>turned</b> in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{development}} of human cerebral asymmetries is yet a debated issue. One prominent manifestation of cerebral asymmetry is handedness with humans showing a dextral population bias. Handedness in humans is not fully established {{before the age of}} six. However, <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference in newborns is thought to be an important factor in the development of later handedness. If this <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference did not disappear completely during development but would prevail into adulthood it might, thus, be associated with handedness. Therefore, this study aimed to assess <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference in adults and to relate a possibly emerging bias to handedness. Forty-two adults (6 females, aged 23 - 63, mean age = 35) participated in the study. <b>Head</b> <b>turning</b> preference was assessed by means of a move during Ju Jutsu martial arts training, which requires the trainee to move the head to either left or right. The direction of head movement is not specified for this move, leaving the choice to the trainee. Handedness was measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Results did not reveal a profound <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> bias in adults. Contrary to the dextral bias in handedness, in this study a leftward bias in <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> emerged from those participants who showed a <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference. <b>Head</b> <b>turning</b> bias did not depend on handedness. The finding of a nearly absent and predominantly leftward <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> bias in this sample is discussed {{in the context of the}} Ju Jutsu task, training experience and trainer bias. It is concluded that the Ju Jutsu move is not a sufficient task to assess <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference in humans. Thus, to further illuminate the relation between <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference and handedness, studies are needed which assess <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> preference in adults in an un-trainable and unbiased situation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} early <b>head</b> <b>turning,</b> we retrospectively studied {{videotapes of}} 262 seizures from 82 {{patients who were}} seizure free after temporal lobectomy. Early head movements were arbitrarily classified into non-tonic turning, tonic turning, and absence of turning. Among the 222 seizures which showed early <b>head</b> <b>turning,</b> 168 (75. 7 %) had non-tonic turning and 54 (24. 3 %) had tonic turning. The direction of the first <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> was ipsilateral to the epileptogenic foci in 132 (78. 6 %) seizures with non-tonic turning and in 35 (64. 8 %) seizures showing tonic <b>head</b> <b>turning.</b> The proportion of seizures with turning towards the ipsilateral side {{in the presence of}} tonic and non-tonic <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> were significantly different (P= 0. 04). Seventy-four seizures (28. 2 %) evolved to secondary generalization, more frequently found in seizures with early <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> (P= 0. 0015) and especially those showing tonic turning (P< 0. 0001). The direction of <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> immediately preceding secondary generalization was contralateral to the lesion side in 53 seizures (82. 8 %). Dystonic upper limb posturing occurred in 86 seizures (32. 8 %), exclusively contralateral to the seizure focus, whereas 65 (75. 6 %) were associated with initial <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> ipsilateral to the focus. In summary, temporal lobe seizures with tonic <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> tends to secondarily generalize and the direction of <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> before secondarily generalized was contralateral to the seizure foci. Earlier in the seizures the direction of non-tonic <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> tends to be towards the epileptogenic hemisphere. In addition, dystonic posturing of the extremities is a significant lateralizing sign to the contralateral hemisphere in temporal lobe seizures...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural lateralisation {{is evident}} across most animal taxa, {{although}} few marsupial and no fossorial {{species have been}} studied. Twelve wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) were bilaterally presented with eight sounds from different contexts (threat, neutral, food) to test for auditory laterality. <b>Head</b> <b>turns</b> were recorded prior to and immediately following sound presentation. Behaviour was recorded for 150 seconds after presentation. Although sound differentiation was evident {{by the amount of}} exploration, vigilance and grooming performed after different sound types, this did not result in different patterns of <b>head</b> <b>turn</b> direction. Similarly, left-right proportions of <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> walking events and food approaches in the post-sound period were comparable across sound types. A comparison of <b>head</b> <b>turns</b> performed before and after sound showed a significant change in turn direction (χ 2 1 = 10. 65, P = 0. 001) from a left preference during the pre-sound period (mean 58 % left <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> CI 49 - 66 %) to a right preference in the post-sound (mean 43 % left <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> CI 40 - 45 %). This provides evidence of a right auditory bias in response to the presentation of the sound. This study therefore demonstrates that laterality is evident in southern hairy-nosed wombats in response to a sound stimulus, although side biases were not altered by sounds of varying context...|$|R

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, English heralds tend to {{identify}} lions as rampant (upright, in profile facing dexter), and leopards as passant guardant (walking, <b>head</b> <b>turned</b> to full face), but the heraldic distinction between lions and leopards is often ambiguous {{and in some}} cases may be controversial (as {{in the case of the}} royal arms of England, discussed below). Part of the confusion arises from international differences in translation or in the defining characteristics of each, particularly in charges that show some characteristics of each.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the subject}} of L'Âme de la France has its own {{individual}} characteristics that contrast strongly with its martial attributes.

25|$|The {{principal}} {{attitude of}} beasts is rampant (i.e. standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised {{as if to}} strike). Beasts also frequently appear walking, passant or, {{in the case of}} stags and the occasional unicorn, trippant, and may appear statant (standing), salient or springing (leaping), sejant (seated), couchant or lodged (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally dormant (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is displayed (i.e. facing the viewer with the <b>head</b> <b>turned</b> toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear rising or rousant (i.e. wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), volant (flying), statant (standing, with wings raised), close (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear naiant (swimming), while cranes may appear vigilant (standing on one leg). Fish often appear naiant (swimming horizontally) or hauriant (upwards) or urinant (downwards), but may also appear addorsed (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear glissant (gliding in a wavy form) or nowed (as a figure-eight knot). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear segreant (i.e. rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear combatant (i.e. two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).|$|E

40|$|Humans {{and other}} {{primates}} are adept at using {{the direction of}} another’s gaze or <b>head</b> <b>turn</b> to infer where that individual is attending. Research in macaque neurophysiology suggests that anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) contains a directionsensitive code for such social attention cues.

It is unclear whether this functional discrepancy {{is caused by a}} species difference or by experimental design differences.
