5000|$|As Texas {{became more}} heavily settled {{following}} annexation by the US, the frontier {{gave way to}} established farms and ranch lands. The leaner longhorn beef was not as attractive in an era where tallow was highly prized, and the longhorn's ability to survive on the poor vegetation of the open range was no longer {{as much of an}} issue. Other breeds demonstrated traits more highly valued by the modern rancher, such as the ability to gain weight quickly. The Texas Longhorn stock slowly dwindled, until in 1927 the breed was saved from near extinction by enthusiasts from the United States Forest Service, who collected a small herd of stock to breed on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Lawton, Oklahoma. The breed also received significant attention after a longhorn named [...] "Bevo" [...] was adopted as the mascot of The University of Texas in 1917, and an image of the animal became commonly associated with Texas Longhorns sports teams. [...] A few years later, J. Frank Dobie and others gathered small herds to keep in Texas state parks. They were cared for largely as curiosities, but the stock's longevity, resistance to disease and ability to thrive on marginal pastures quickly revived the breed as beef stock and for their link to Texas history. Texas Longhorns with elite genetics can often fetch $40,000 or more at auction with the record of $380,000 on March 18, 2017 for a cow 3S Danica and <b>heifer</b> <b>calf</b> at side during the Legacy XIII sale in Fort Worth, Texas.|$|E
50|$|The breed, {{originating}} in the northeast of England {{in the latter part}} of the 18th century, was ideal for both dairy and beef production. Pure-bred shorthorn cattle had been a feature at Brayton from the first half of the 19th century. The original animals came from the Benson and Charity strain. The pedigree went back to Volume 1 and 2 of the Coates's Herd Book where an entry records Violet the grand-dam of the original Benson tribe. In 1839, Lawson added stock from the Gwynne tribe and by careful breeding and future sales the breed dispersed throughout the country to the great improvement of the general stock. After the death of the first baronet in 1867, the new owner dispersed the herd, the 96 animals averaging a price of £34 each. Lawson retained a few cows for the dairy and the farm and after the introduction of some highly bred animals of the Bates blood, the herd soon revived. The Bates shorthorns commanded high prices. In 1874, George Moore, a neighbour and close friend of Lawson’s paid £1,100 for an Oxford cow at the Duke of Devonshire’s sale. In the following year when he dispersed of his herd he sold the same cow for £2,200, while her three-month-old <b>heifer</b> <b>calf</b> realised £1,100, bought curiously enough by the same Duke of Devonshire. However, it was not all good news for a cow he had bought for £1,000 three years earlier sold for only £60. A visitor to the estate in 1876, reported that Lawson owned 100 cows and a large number of bulls, all of Durham shorthorn stock. He understood that Lawson had paid £3,000 for a cow and owned a bull weighing 1,000 kilograms which he boasted was priceless. In October 1906, following the death of the second baronet, the third baronet sold the entire herd of 68 animals, the 61 cows and heifers realised an average of £37 each and the 7 bulls £42.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of cow age on grazing distribution relative to mountain riparian areas. In each of two years, sixty cow-calf pairs were stratified by age into the following treatments: 1) thirty first <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (442 kg, body condition score (BCS) = 4. 5), and 2) thirty mature cows (5 - 7 years of age; 569 kg, BCS= 5. 0). From late July to early September, treatments were randomly assigned to four pastures with treatments reversed in Year 2. Analysis of hourly cattle locations observed during 4 -d periods early (d 15 to d 18) and late (d 36 to d 39 in Year 1; d 29 to d 32 in Year 2) during the grazing bout revealed a three-way interaction between cow age, time of day, and grazing bout (P 0. 10) in distribution occurred between age classes from 1300 h until dark. Similarly, during the late grazing bout, no differences were observed (P> 0. 10) between the distribution of the age classes. While no difference (P= 0. 20) occurred between age classes in total minutes spent grazing, first <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> foraged longer during the morning and evening bouts (P 0. 10) between age classes. While mature cows tended (P= 0. 17) to have higher dry matter intake (DMI), first <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> consumed more feed per unit of body weight (BW) (P= 0. 08). Though first <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> tended (P= 0. 13) to gain more BW, no differences occurred between age classes in BCS change (P= 0. 69), or calf average daily gain (ADG) (P= 0. 34).

40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of 4 herds of composite-bred (50 % Bos indicus/Sanga, 50 % Bos taurus) cattle grazing native pasture in the Barkly Tableland region (Northern Territory) was studied for 5 years. Predictive models of {{reproductive performance}} were developed from 6210 breeder records and 2006 calf records, {{based on the}} easily measurable indicators, breeder body condition (BCS; using a 9 -point scale) and weight for <b>heifers,</b> second <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> and cows. Breeder BCS (mean = 6) and weight (mean = 504 kg) were higher than typically reported for northern Australia, as were pregnancy rates and calf growth rates from birth to weaning. Pregnancy rates for heifers (90 %) were lower (P< 0. 05) than second <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (93 %) and cows (95 %). Calf growth for progeny of heifers (853 g/d) was lower (P< 0. 05) than for second <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> (900 g/d) and cows (903 g/d). The exceptional reproductive performance of these herds {{is likely to be}} a consequence of above average nutrition, breed effects and management. Increasing pregnancy rates and earlier conception dates (as measured by rectal palpation) were associated with increasing breeder weight. Increasing pregnancy rates were also associated with increasing BCS. There was an inverse relationship between BCS and calf growth for progeny of breeders of BCS 4 and above. This study has established new reproductive performance benchmarks for this region of northern Australia, and has shown that breed composition of up to 62. 5 % Bos taurus in the tick-free regions can be highly productive.

40|$|What is {{the value}} of a <b>heifer</b> <b>calf,</b> a bred heifer, or a re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How does that value compare to the current market price? What is your cost of raising a <b>heifer</b> <b>calf,</b> bred heifer, or re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How many pencils have been worn dull or how many {{spreadsheets}} have been created to answer these questions? The unrealistic objective {{of this paper is to}} answer these questions. Perhaps a more realistic objective is to answer some of these questions and to provide you the framework to answer some of the questions for your own operation. One approach to determine value is to simply consider the market price for the heifer. However, this is only the true value if you actually sell the heifer. If you keep the heifer, then her true value is based on her future production, your annual costs to keep her, and the future market prices for calves and for a cull cow when the heifer is ultimately sold. When one considers these factors and how variable they are from year-to-year, from ranch-to-ranch and from heifer-to-heifer there is no single value that will be correct. However, there are some correct principles to determine these values for individual operations. Replacement heifer management from weaning of the <b>heifer</b> <b>calf,</b> to breeding, to calving and to re-breeding can greatly impact the future productivity of a heifer and therefore impact the value of the heifer. There may also be significant differences in costs associated with alternative heifer management programs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heifer {{development}} on first calving and subsequent reproductive performance was evaluated in Angus x Hereford (AxH) and Brahman x Hereford (BxH) females. Heifers were fed to reach either 55 % or 65 % of their projected mature body weight by {{the start of}} their first breeding season. After breeding, the heifers were managed as a typical commercial range beef cow herd. Angus x Hereford heifers developed to the higher prebreeding target weights: 1) were heavier (P<. 05) at calving; 2) had larger (P<. 05) total precalving pelvic areas; and 3) had higher (P<. 05) average postcalving body condition scores. Precalving pelvic areas were also greater (P<. 05) among BxH females developed to the higher prebreeding target weight. Angus x Hereford heifers fed to the low target weight experienced 23. 5 % more calving problems (52. 3 vs 28. 8 %).

In an affected bull calf, initially evaluated because of excessive bleeding from a vaccination site, the platelet aggregation response to the agonist, adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) was essentially absent and the aggregation response to platelet activating factor (PAF 16) was reduced by at least 70 %. The initial laboratory assessment of platelet function in the dam and sire yielded results which were within normal limits. The sire was not available for further testing. The dam, also a daughter of this sire, was subsequently shown to have a partially reduced aggregation response to ADP. Of 18 other offspring of the sire evaluated, 6 were also identified as having a partially impaired aggregation response.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study from 2014 {{it was found that}} US Holstein cows that gave birth to heifer calves produced more milk than cows having bull calves.

Data from 578 Danish Holstein herds were analysed with a mixed effect model and contrary to the findings in the US, we found that cows produced higher volumes of milk if they had a bull calf compared to a <b>heifer</b> <b>calf.</b> We found a significantly higher milk production of 0. 28 % in the first lactation period for cows giving birth to a bull calf, compared to a <b>heifer</b> <b>calf.</b> This difference was even higher when cows gave birth to another bull calf, so having two bull calves resulted in a difference of 0. 52 % in milk production compared to any other combination of sex of the offspring. Furthermore, we found that farmer assisted calvings were associated with a higher milk yield. Cows with no farmer assistance or with veterinary assistance during the most recent calving produced less milk. There were also indications that dams would favor a bull fetus by decreasing milk production during the second pregnancy if the calf born in the first parity was a heifer.
