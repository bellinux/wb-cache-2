40|$|Biological {{damage of}} tissue due to <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> is {{generally}} {{known to be}} very important in radiobiology and radiation protection. However, there is no suitable method to determine the quality of these neutrons in particular in the working environment of mixed (n,y) radiation fields. In this thesis, an attempt is made to develop a dosimeter based on microdosimetric principles which has the capability for such a purpose. With this object the basic concepts of microdosimetry are reviewed and discussed with emphasis on their application for radiation protection and in designing of the dosimeter. Microdosimetry based on low pressure tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs) is a powerful technique for determining microscopic distributions of energy deposition and quality of ionizing radiations. However the energy deposition spectra of <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> in mixed fields of fast neutrons can only be measured using TEPC in co-axial double cylindrical form by an appropriate choice for the thickness of the common tissue-equivalent (TE) dividing wall separating the inner and outer counters and by appropriate use of coincidence/anti-coincidence pulse arrangements. An analytical calculation for the response of the inner counter operating in coincidence/anti-coincidence modes with the outer counter was developed. However there will be some events, due to fast neutrons, which will contribute to the signals from <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> and which cannot be removed by anti-coincidence. For these analytical corrections must be made. Also, the events associated with the dividing wall inherent in the system can contribute to the response of the inner counter and must be corrected by calculation. The calculation was possible {{due to the fact that}} recoil particles from <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutron</b> interactions have effective stopping powers and projected ranges which differ significantly from the continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA) values. By incorporating these the basic CSDA formulae for energy deposition spectra of neutrons could be extended down to <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> of about 1 keV. A prototype co-axial double cylindrical TEPC capable of separating the component of neutrons (≤ 850 keV) in mixed (n,y) radiation fields was manufactured and tested. The thin wall dividing the inner and outer counters was fabricated from the standard A- 150 TE plastic with the thickness equivalent to the range of 850 keV protons. The operational characteristics of the dosimeter were studied to determine its applicability for use in microdosimetry. The gas gain of the inner and outer TEPCs was measured at various simulated mean chord lengths and applied voltages. The results can be expressed according to Campion's equation within a given range of the electric field strength. The resolution of the inner TEPC measured at the operating voltages is in agreement with the theoretical prediction. A series of microdosimetric experiments were performed with mixed fields of 60 Co gamma-rays and neutrons from the UTR- 300 nuclear reactor and from 252 Cf and 241 Am-Be radioactive sources. Discrimination against fast neutrons of energy > 850 keV was achieved using an anti-coincidence unit specially designed for better efficiency of data acquisition. Discrimination against fast electrons due to photon interactions was also achieved. Spectra with anti-coincidence are dominated by slow protons and electrons. Their mean lineal energies are higher than those of spectra without anti-coincidence. The quality factor and dose equivalent for spectra with anti-coincidence are higher than the spectra without anticoincidence indicating the importance of <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> in mixed fields. The quality factor and the corresponding dose equivalent corrected for saturation of lineal energy corresponding to 2 nm of ionization spacing is consistently higher than those derived from the absorbed dose based formulae, the biophysical implications of which are discussed. Suggestion for future developments for microdosimetry of <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutrons</b> in mixed fields are made and discussed...|$|R

These uncertainties were detected for Si/Pu ratios ranging from approximately 20 : 1 to 200 : 1. Additionally, {{it has been reported}} that metal/U{sup 235 } mixtures also have data uncertainties.

There is however, a definite lack of critical experiments with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>neutron</b> spectrum. We have identified two potential areas from which these uncertainties may arise.

40|$|It was {{established}} in numerical experiments conducted at the Institute for Safety Research and Reactor Technologies (ISR- 2) of the research center Forschungszentrum Jülich (1998 – 1999) that thorium-plutonium fuel composition ensures due {{to the presence of}} anomaly in the dependence of resonance neutron absorption on the ratio of moderator volume to fuel volume the possibility to organize super-long duration of fuel residence in the cores of VVER-type reactors. Such possibility was demonstrated in the present study for high-temperature thorium-loaded reactor installation with 60 MW power. In this case the ratio of moderator volume to the volume of resonance absorber in the reactor core is within the interval of (45 – 60). It is specifically such type of low-power reactor installations that may constitute the basis of regional power generation in Russia. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the neutronics characteristics of thorium-loaded low-power reactor installation with fuel blocks and fuel pellets with different configurations in order to select the reactor core design and the core fuel load ensuring optimal utilization of thorium in it and obtaining maximum possible generation of energy in the course of super-long fuel residence in the core.

40|$|Proteins undergo an {{apparent}} dynamical transition on temperature variation {{that has been}} correlated {{with the onset of}} function. The transition in the mean-square displacement, 〈Δr 2 〉, that is observed using a spectrometer or computer simulation, depends on the relationship between the timescales of the relaxation processes activated and the timescale accessible to the instrument or simulation. Models are described of two extreme situations—an “equilibrium” model, in which the long-time dynamics changes with temperature and all motions are resolved by the instrument used; and a “frequency window” model, {{in which there is no}} change in the long-time dynamics but as the temperature increases, the relaxation frequencies move into the instrumental range. Here we demonstrate that the latter, frequency-window model can describe the temperature and timescale dependences of both the <b>intermediate</b> <b>neutron</b> scattering function and 〈Δr 2 〉 derived from molecular dynamics simulations of a small protein in a cryosolution. The frequency-window model also describes the energy-resolution and temperature-dependences of 〈Δr 2 〉 obtained from experimental neutron scattering on glutamate dehydrogenase in the same solvent. Although equilibrium effects should also contribute to dynamical transitions in proteins, the present results suggests that frequency-window effects can play a role in the simulations and experiments examined. Finally, misquotations of previous findings are discussed in the context of solvent activation of protein dynamics and the possible relationship of this to activity...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} super-AGB thermal pulse (TP) stars {{for a range of}} metallicities (Z) and explore the effect of convective boundary mixing (CBM). With decreasing metallicity and evolution along the TP phase, the He-shell flash and the third dredge-up (TDU) occur closer together in time. After some time (depending upon the CBM parameterisation), efficient TDU begins while the pulse-driven convection zone (PDCZ) is still present, causing a convective exchange of material between the PDCZ and the convective envelope. This results in the ingestion of protons into the convective He-burning pulse. Even small amounts of CBM encourage the interaction of the convection zones leading to transport of protons from the convective envelope into the He layer. H-burning luminosities exceed 10 ^ 9 (in some cases 10 ^ 10) L_. We also calculate models of dredge-out in the most massive super-AGB stars and show that the dredge-out phenomenon is another likely site of convective-reactive H-^ 12 C combustion. We discuss the substantial uncertainties of stellar evolution models under these conditions. Nevertheless, the simulations suggest that in the convective-reactive H-combustion regime of H ingestion the star may encounter conditions for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>neutron</b> capture process (i process). We speculate that some CEMP-s/r stars could originate in i-process conditions in the H-ingestion phases of low-Z SAGB stars.

40|$|Nuclear {{astrophysics}} simulations {{aiming to}} study {{the origin of the}} elements in stars require a multitude of nuclear physics input. Both systematic model dependent and statistically correlated uncertainties need to be considered. An application where realistic uncertainty assessments are especially important is the <b>intermediate</b> <b>neutron</b> capture process or i process: a neutron capture regime with neutron densities intermediate between the slow and rapid processes. Accordingly, the main network flux proceeds on the neutron-rich unstable isotopes up to 4 - 5 species off the valley of stability. The i process has been clearly identified to be active in post-AGB stars during the Very Late Thermal Pulse H-ingestion event, and a recent work infers about its important role in early generations of stars. Here we demonstrate the effect of propagating systematic nuclear uncertainties from different theoretical models to final abundances for a region around the 2 ^nd peak at A-Z= 80 for elemental ratio predictions involving Ba, La and Eu in i-process conditions. These elements are used to distinguish different n-capture contributions observed in low-metallicity stars. For the simple 1 -zone model adopted here, predictions vary as much as a factor of 22 in on possible observational plane ([La/Eu] vs. [Ba/La]). To consider statistically correlated uncertainties, we similarly perform a full nuclear physics uncertainty study within a given Hauser-Feshbach model and demonstrate the role of correlations on the final stellar abundance uncertainties. We show that in i-process conditions the main result of neglecting correlations is to underestimate the impact of nuclear uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis yields by as much as two orders of magnitude.

40|$|We {{have found}} an attractor for an axially {{symmetric}} magnetic field evolving under the Hall effect and subdominant ohmic dissipation, resolving {{the question of}} the long term fate of the magnetic field in neutron star crusts. The electron fluid is in isorotation, analogous to Ferraro's law, with its angular velocity being approximately proportional to the poloidal magnetic flux, Ω∝Ψ. This equilibrium is the long term configuration of a magnetic field evolving because of the Hall effect and ohmic dissipation. For an initial dipole dominated field the attractor consists mainly of a dipole and an octupole component accompanied by an energetically negligible quadrupole toroidal field. The field dissipates in a self-similar way: although higher multipoles should have been decaying faster, the toroidal field mediates transfer of energy into them from the lower ones, leading to an advection diffusion equilibrium and keeping the ratio of the poloidal multipoles almost constant. This has implications for the structure of the <b>intermediate</b> age <b>neutron</b> stars, suggesting that their poloidal field should consist of a dipole and a octupole component accompanied by a very weak toroidal quadrupole.

For this purpose, small Aluminium boxes containing a set of circular-shaped neutron activation foils have been prepared. After being irradiated for one complete reactor cycle, the sets have been successfully retrieved, followed by gamma-spectrometric measurements of the individual foils at NRG. Along with the individual activities of the foils, the reaction rates and thermal, <b>intermediate</b> and fast <b>neutron</b> fluence rates at the foil locations have been determined. These determinations include appropriate corrections for gamma self-absorption and neutron self-shielding as well as corresponding measurement uncertainties. The comparison of the NPP Monte Carlo calculations with the results of the foil measurements is done by using an individual generic MCNP model functioning as an interface and allowing the simulation of individual foil activation by predetermined neutron spectra. To summarize, the comparison between calculation and measurement serve as a sound validation of the Swiss NPP activation methodology by demonstrating a satisfying agreement between measurement and calculation. Finally, the validation offers a chance for further improvements of the existing NPP models by ensuing calibration and/or modelling optimizations for key components and structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the photons arising at radiation {{capture of the}} neutrons on tye nuclei of the materials applied in reactor building. The aim is to obtain the experimental data about the spectra of the photon accompanying the capture of the <b>intermediate</b> and fast <b>neutrons</b> necessary for testing design programs of the neutron and photon transfer in the substance; to investigate the regularities inherent in the spectra of the capture photons coming out from materials applied in the reactor building depending on the energy of neutrons. The obtained data are the support information for testing of the transfer constants on the neutrons and photons in the substance; the correction of the constant libraries on base of the obtained experimental data can lead in th future to the correction of the dimensions and mass of the biological protections for the nuclear power plant (NPP) and also to the more reliable evaluation of the durability of the structural members (in the first turn, vessel) of NPP. The new support experimental data about spectra of the photons accompanying the capture of the neutrons with different energy {{for a number of}} the materials (iron, lead, aluminium, titanium, copper, nickel, chromium, molybdenium) have been obtained. The system analysis of the obtained experimental data for wide set of the different thickness investigated materials and for shape-different neutron spectra has been performedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{data have}} been {{gathered}} {{since the early}} 1990 s on the response of different detectors based on the registration of neutron- induced fission in bismuth, gold, tantalum by the spark replica counter and the thin film breakdown counter. These detectors {{make it possible to}} exploit the excellent characteristics of the fission reactions in bismuth, gold and tantalum for the measurements of high- energy neutrons. Most of the investigations have been carried out at the quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam facility at The Svedberg Laboratory-TSL of the Uppsala University in cooperation with the Khlopin Radium Institute (KRI). The responses of different fission detectors in the <b>intermediate</b> range of <b>neutron</b> energy (35 - 180 MeV) have been evaluated: a region where the predictive power of available nuclear reaction models and codes is not reliable yet. For neutron energy greater than 200 MeV, the fission-detector responses have been derived from the data of the proton fission cross-sections. Finally, by using the ratio of the responses of these detectors, a simple and accurate way to evaluate the spectrum hardness can be obtained, thus providing a tool to obtain spectral information needed for neutron dosimetry without the need to know the entire spectrum. The experimentally measured spectra obtained to-date have different shapes and they are also different from those calculated. In this paper, a new approach will be reported to analyse the existing spectra by using response ratios of different detectors. Preliminary data have been already obtained for the high-energy neutron spectrum from the CERN concrete facility...|$|R
40|$|This {{workshop}} was {{the sixth}} {{of a series}} and was held on July 11 and 12, 1977, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Those presenting papers at the Sixth Workshop prepared summary reports of their recent work for inclusion in this document. The reports are reproduced here as submitted by the participants, with only minor editing. This year's Workshop took a decidedly international flavor, with participants from seven countries {{in addition to the}} United States. The significance of this group's contributions has raised the possibility that the next Neutron Dosimetry Workshop may be held in Europe. Of particular interest at the Workshop was the keynote address by Dr. Harald Rossi. He commented that there is evidence that 1) accepted values of RBE for low absorbed doses of neutrons may be low by an order of magnitude or more and 2) the risk of leukemia is significant at 0. 5 rad to the bone narrow. A reduction of the limit for permissible neutron exposure, which could result from consideration of this information, would necessitate major improvements in our "middle ages" neutron dosimetry. A number of participants reported conversions to thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) systems. This move has not been unanimous, however, as there were several reports of apparently satisfactory fission fragment, activation foil, and NTA film dosimeters. While thementionof NTA film resulted in the usual discussion of energy cut off and humidity effects, it seems the use of NTA in accelerator environments still has some merit. Discussion of fission fragment dosimeters centered around track etching techniques, which have shown some improvement. Of particular interest was Tommasino's report on the use of polycarbonate centrifuge tubes as the sensitive element. Thermally stimulated exoelectron emission (TSEE), never very popular for personnel dosimetry, has lost additional ground with the report that the neutron/gamma response ratio is much less than earlier work had indicated. Initial work with an experimental Harshaw CaF:thulium TLD shows some promise. This TLD exhibits a double-humped glow peak (150 °C and 240 °C), which may permit separation of neutron and gamma components from a single TLD chip. There was a plea for uniformity in neutron-to-dose conversion factors. A typical example of 120 % differences between commonly used factors was cited. Perhaps it i s time for a new look at the problem by an international standards-setting group. Measurement of neutron spectra around facilities would be easier with a good, portable multichannel analyzer. Dr. Harry Ing may have one. It has 64 channels in a 6 - in. x 8 - in. x 2 1 / 2 -in. package (including the display) and is battery powered. A new <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>neutron</b> source is available at Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories (UK). An SbBe source in a water-filled boron ball was reported to produce a neutron spectrum centered around 1 / 2 keV. Additional efforts of this type coupled with the "monoenergetic" sources available at the National Bureau of Standards will permit significant improvement in neutron dosimeter calibrations...|$|R
40|$|Background: For {{the deeply}} bound one-nucleon removal at {{intermediate}} energies using a 9 Be or 12 C target, a strong reduction of cross section was observed {{relative to the}} prediction of eikonal theoretical model. The large disagreement has not been explained and the systematic trend is inconsistent with results from transfer reactions. The recently observed asymmetric parallel momentum distribution of the knockout residue indicates the significant dissipative core-target interaction in the knockout reaction with a composite target, implying new reaction mechanisms beyond the eikonal reaction descriptions. Purpose: To investigate the reaction mechanism for deeply bound nucleon removal at <b>intermediate</b> energies. Method: <b>Neutron</b> removal from 14 O using a 12 C target at 60 MeV/nucleon was performed. Nucleon knockout cross sections were measured. The unbound excited states of 13 O were reconstructed by using the invariant mass method with the residues and the associated decay protons measured in coincidence. The measured cross sections are compared with an intra-nuclear cascade (INC) prediction. Results: The measured cross section of (14 O, 11 C) is 60 (9) mb, which is 3. 5 times larger than that of (14 O, 13 O) channel. This 2 pn-removal cross section is consistent with INC prediction, which is 66 mb with the main contribution being non-direct reaction processes. On the other hand, the upper limit of the cross section for one-neutron removal from 14 O followed by proton evaporation is 4. 6 (20) mb, integrated up to 6 MeV above the proton separation energy of 13 O. The calculated total cross section for such reaction processes by the INC model is 2. 5 mb, which is within the measured upper limit. Conclusions: The data provide the first constraint on the role of core excitation and evaporation processes in deeply bound nucleon removal from asymmetric nuclei. The experiment results suggest that non-direct reaction processes, which are not considered in the eikonal model, {{play an important role in}} deeply bound nucleon removal from asymmetric nuclei at intermediate energies. status: publishe...|$|R
