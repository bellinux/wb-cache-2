5|$|Upon Nevelson's death her {{estate was}} {{worth at least}} $100 million. Her son, Mike Nevelson, removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works, worth millions, to her friend and {{assistant}} of 25 years Diana MacKown, yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise. Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There was talk of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers, MacKown maintained that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sexual relationship with Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E

5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do {{in the event of}} fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E
5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack or stroke.|$|E

25|$|Although not a pacifist, in {{his later}} years Robertson often spoke out against the cost – both {{financial}} and human – of war. His interests were fishing, shooting and golf. Early in 1933 he told Edmonds that his chief regret was that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> command in the field. He died from a thrombosis on 12 February 1933, aged 73. Mount Robertson in the Canadian Rockies and Sir William Robertson High School in his birth village, Welbourn, were named after him.|$|E

25|$|Fred first {{encountered}} Rosemary Letts in early 1969 (shortly after her 15th birthday). The pair first met at Cheltenham bus station. Initially, Rose was repulsed by Fred's unkempt appearance, and deduced {{he was a}} tramp, although she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish upon her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Reportedly, Rose twice refused to accompany Fred upon a date, although she agreed {{to allow him to}} accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} protest {{related to}} disability rights was the Deaf President Now protest by the Gallaudet University students in Washington, D.C. in March 1988. The 8-day (March 6 – March 13) demonstration and occupation and lock-out {{of the school}} began when the Board of Trustees appointed a new hearing President, Elisabeth Zinser, over two Deaf candidates. The students’ primary grievance was that the university, which was dedicated {{to the education of}} people who are Deaf, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Deaf president, someone representative of them. Of the protesters’ four demands, the main one was the resignation of the current president and the appointment of a Deaf one. The student demonstration consisted of about 2,000 participants who were not just students. The protests not only took place on campus, but they also took it to government buildings and marched through the streets. In the end, all the students’ demands were met and I. King Jordan was appointed the first Deaf President of the university.|$|E
25|$|He was {{promoted}} to yokozuna in 1935, after finishing as runner-up in the May tournament that year. He had had good scores in the previous two tournaments as well, and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> make-koshi or losing score in his career. Nevertheless, his promotion at that point came as a surprise, and {{it was suggested that}} it had been engineered by the Takasago ichimon or stable group, so that Musashiyama's Dewanoumi group would be obliged to support the promotion of Minanogawa in return. Unfortunately, Musashiyama proved {{to be one of the}} least successful yokozuna ever. He was often absent from tournaments because of his elbow injury and did not win any further championships. He was so popular that he was always in demand to perform on regional tours, and rarely had a chance to recuperate properly from his injury. In his eight tournaments at yokozuna rank, he missed five, withdrew from two, and only managed one kachi-koshi or winning score. In his only kachi-koshi tournament, he faced yokozuna Minanogawa in a battle of two 6–6 yokozuna, and he defeated Minanogawa, which resulted in his opponent having a make-koshi, a very rare result for a yokozuna. He retired at the age of 29 without achieving any lasting success as a yokozuna, in May 1939. He had long been overshadowed by Futabayama, then at the peak of his career.|$|E

500|$|On appointment, Ramsey {{immediately}} {{caused a}} stir when he predicted [...] "we will win the World Cup", {{which was to be}} hosted in England in 1966.

Moore came from working-class roots in the East End of London, similar to Ramsey. England <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> captain so young—Moore was only 22 years and 47 days old when he captained the side for the first time away against Czechoslovakia on 29 May 1963.

He said he was leaving because [...] "there can be little left to conquer in professional football". His record at Buffalo was 36–17–3. Saban, however, only stayed at Maryland for one season in which the team posted a 4–6 record. He returned to professional football as coach of the AFL's Denver Broncos in December 1966, signing a 10-year contract with an annual salary of $50,000 ($ in [...] dollars). When he joined, the Broncos <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> winning season in seven years of existence.

Steve Kandell of New York magazine wrote: [...] "This is obviously the moment when Ben’s begrudging respect for her becomes something else", and The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow wrote: [...] "Parks and Recreation has allowed Ben to develop in the background so far, but his affection for Pawnee is clearly growing." ...|$|E
