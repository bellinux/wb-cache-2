25|$|With the Byzantine threat ended, the Sassanid Empire {{was still}} a {{formidable}} power with vast manpower reserves, and the Arabs soon found themselves confronting a huge Persian army with troops drawn <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the empire and commanded by its foremost generals.

Within three months, Saad defeated the Persian army in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, effectively ending Sassanid rule west of Persia proper. This victory is largely regarded as a decisive turning point in Islam's growth: with the bulk of Persian forces defeated, Saad with his companions later conquered Babylon (Battle of Babylon (636)), Kūthā, Sābāṭ (Valashabad) and Bahurasīr (Veh-Ardashir). Ctesiphon, the Imperial capital of the Sassanid Empire, fell in March 637 after a siege of three months.|$|E

Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a series of shots — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension in the Sept — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought."
