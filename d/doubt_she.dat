5|$|The Harajuku Lovers Tour was {{the first}} solo concert tour of American {{recording}} artist Gwen Stefani. The tour began through October to November 2005, to support of her debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Although Stefani embarked on multiple tours with her band No <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> initially opted {{not to participate in}} a tour to promote her album, an attitude that the singer eventually abandoned due to the commercial success of Love. Angel. Music. Baby.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 musical Enchanted, {{in which}} she played a cheerful Disney Princess, was Adams' first major success as a leading lady. She {{followed}} it by playing naive, optimistic women {{in a series of}} films, including in the 2008 drama <b>Doubt.</b> <b>She</b> subsequently played stronger female parts to positive reviews in the sports film The Fighter (2010), and the psychological drama The Master (2012). In 2013, she began portraying Lois Lane in superhero films set in the DC Extended Universe. She won two consecutive Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film American Hustle (2013) and the troubled painter Margaret Keane in the biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she received acclaim for her leading roles in the science fiction film Arrival and the psychological thriller Nocturnal Animals.|$|E
25|$|Dyer's {{downfall}} {{came when}} the bagged corpse of an infant was discovered in the Thames, with evidence leading to her. She was arrested on 4 April 1896, tried {{for the murder of}} infant Doris Marmon, and hanged on 10 June 1896. At the time of her death, a handful of murders were attributed to her, but there is little <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> was responsible for many more similar deaths—possibly 400 or more.|$|E

25|$|Once accused, Miss Gilchrist {{breaks down}} in a flood of {{complaints}} of the hardships {{of her life and}} fantasies about a new teashop. She goes quietly with Inspector Morton. Thus Poirot answered the question Mr Entwhistle hired him to resolve, and untangled the mystery of Cora's death. Miss Gilchrist is found guilty at trial. In her time in prison during legal proceedings, she is quickly becoming insane, planning one tea shop after another. Mr Entwhistle and Hercule Poirot suspect her punishment might be served in Broadmoor, but have no <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> had plotted and carried out the cold blooded murder in full possession of her faculties – this ladylike murderer.|$|E
25|$|Countess de Ficquelmont met Alexander Pushkin during fall 1829 {{and often}} {{invited him to}} her Saint Petersburg Palace. They became friends. In 1922 {{historian}} Mstislav Tsiavlovski published the writings of poet Nachtchokine (Pushkin's friend): according to Barteniev, Pushkin {{was in love with}} a brilliant socialite noblewoman holding a salon in Saint Petersburg. Even if the lady is not named, no <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> is Countess de Ficquelmont. Ficquelmont's palace is also believed to be the frame for the old Countess' palace in Pushkin's story The Queen of Spades. Pushkin would also have depicted his own feelings for Dolly through Hermann's love for Lise. However, historian Leonid Grossman has said Pushkin only saw himself as a new Boccaccio. Indeed, the relationship between Countess de Ficquelmont and her husband was perfect.|$|E
25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath had gone off on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. No <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> was abducted because she wanted to be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, witness Mark Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep in their hearts.. They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E

6000|$|... "Wandering," [...] he says, kinder troubled--"wandering, {{without any}} <b>doubt.</b> <b>She's</b> in a wind now that's blowing her south of east. We don't {{know how long}} that's been going on, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|A woman, when <b>she</b> <b>doubts</b> whether <b>she</b> loves or {{does not}} love, is {{inclined}} five parts out of six toward the man of whom she is thinking. When a woman <b>doubts</b> <b>she</b> is lost, the cynics say. I simply assert, being no cynic, that when a woman <b>doubts</b> <b>she</b> is won. The more Fanny thought of Mr. Saul, the more she {{felt that he was}} not the man for whom she had first taken him--that he was of larger dimensions as regarded spirit, manhood and heart, and better entitled to a woman's love. She would not tell herself that she was attached to him; but in all her arguments with herself against him, she rested her objection mainly on {{the fact that he had}} but seventy pounds a year. And then the threatened attack, the attack that was to be final, came upon her before she was prepared for it! ...|$|R
500|$|Despite Seymour's statement, Williams {{maintained}} {{that he was}} innocent of the murder and the burglary, saying that [...] "whoever did that did it to get to [...] papers for political purposes. No <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> is mixed up in some foreign political business. I would not commit a crime like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would {{let me have a}} baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs of}} their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} as a solo artist, Stefani has won several music awards, {{including}} one Grammy Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, one American Music Award, one Brit Award, and two Billboard Music Awards. With No <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> has won two Grammy Awards. In 2005, Rolling Stone called her [...] "the only true female rock star left on radio or MTV" [...] and featured her on the magazine's cover. Stefani received the Style Icon Award at the first People Magazine Awards in 2014. Additionally in 2016, the singer was honored at the Radio Disney Music Awards with a Hero Award, which is given to artists based on their personal contributions to various charitable works.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, {{following}} Stefani's {{work with}} No <b>Doubt,</b> <b>she</b> {{enlisted the help}} of Greg Kurstin to write and produce songs for her upcoming third studio album. After Stefani's 2014 single releases, [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", received mixed responses, she scrapped all of her completed material for the opportunity to start fresh. A year later, Stefani enlisted other potential collaborators, like Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, for work on the album shortly after she announced her divorce from Gavin Rossdale. Stefani later revealed that during the writing of several songs, including [...] "Rare", she and Michaels had taken [...] "stream-of-conscious" [...] lyrics from her computer and fit them into melodies.|$|E
500|$|American Canadian {{linguist}} William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated {{tone and}} intonation {{for the most}} part; he claimed this led to [...] "exaggerated complexities" [...] in her description, {{particularly with respect to}} the final intonational fall in interrogatives. When Armstrong wrote her manuscript, analysis of tone was a nascent field and the complex relationship between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch led phoneticians to analyze languages as having large numbers of tones. In 1952, SOAS linguist Lyndon Harries was able to take Armstrong's data and analyze Kikuyu tone as only having two underlying tone levels. American linguist Mary Louise Pratt also re-analyzed Armstrong's Kikuyu data as only having two levels. Pratt also noted Armstrong did not distinguish allophonically long vowels from vowels which are phonemically long. University of Nairobi linguist Kevin C. Ford wrote that if Armstrong had not died before completing this book [...] "there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> could have expanded her range of data and probably presented some rigorous analysis, which is sadly lacking in the published work". The American phonologist Nick Clements described Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as [...] "an extremely valuable source of information due to the comprehensiveness of its coverage and accuracy of the author's phonetic observations".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Tandy, Nappi did {{not read}} the books before {{illustrating}} them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting. Nappi's first cover was for The Clue of the Velvet Mask, where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as [...] "bobby-soxer... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In {{the majority of his}} covers Nancy looks startled– which, no <b>doubt,</b> <b>she</b> was." [...] Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of Pamela Sue Martin inserted on the book covers.|$|E

500|$|The only European {{shows in}} Paris, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the second Parisian show a five star review. He praised the {{performance}} abilities of both artists, explaining [...] "When left to [...] own devices on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little {{for him to}} have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', as he looks dapper in honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in a denim military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without <b>doubt,</b> <b>she</b> lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show." [...] Simon Harper of Clash felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an [...] "incredible presence and deafening screams from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with [...] "The music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top. But damn, it was a good race to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Darwin {{appears to}} have had doubts as a month later {{in a letter to}} the French {{zoologist}} Armand de Quatrefages he wrote: [...] "I wish the translator had known more of Natural History; she must be a clever, but singular lady; but I never heard of her, till she proposed to translate my book." [...] He was unhappy with Royer's footnotes and {{in a letter to the}} botanist Joseph Hooker he wrote: [...] "Almost everywhere in Origin, when I express great <b>doubt,</b> <b>she</b> appends a note explaining the difficulty or saying that there is none whatever!! It is really curious to know what conceited people there are in the world,..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun {{about her}} {{portrayal}} of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. [...] "From {{my point of}} view, Reese is {{not in love with}} Zach and she never has been," [...] said Braun. [...] "As far as the kiss, any <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far as I am concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E
50|$|She {{must have}} {{resolved}} whatever <b>doubts</b> <b>she</b> had {{before going to}} California, for after she returned to Dayton in 1912 she expanded her artistic repertoire to include both her portrait business, and artistic images.

The task was difficult; débutantes {{were expected to}} display grace and dignity or face the ruin of their first London season. However, young Georgiana had not inherited her mother's poise and ease of movement, and tended to keep her head down. Her court dress, complemented with the Cavendish diamonds, was considered a dramatic success [...] Soon after, she came out in society during a ball held in her honour. Lady Holland observed Georgiana and described her as [...] "a most charming girl–sensible, pleasing, full of information and totally without a particle of affectation, and if she bestows herself upon a man equal to her situation, I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>she</b> will make a most delightful wife".|$|E
