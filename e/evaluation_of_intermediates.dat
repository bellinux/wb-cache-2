40|$|The {{development}} of natural cyclodextrins (CDs) for various industrial applications (agroalimentary, cosmetic or pharmaceutical) constitutes a continuous challenge. For {{the integration of}} these agricultural plant products {{in the creation of}} super-absorbent biodegradable and hypoallergenic materials (water-retaining agents, cosmetic hydrating and texturing, pharmaceutical and horticultural products) to replace synthetic polymers, we have developed chemical methods to access regioselectively C- 6 -derivatized maltooligosaccharides starting from CDs. These compounds are highly suitable for further chemical modifications and are expected to give access to a new class of polymeric materials with potential applications such as water-retaining agents in the disposable nappies industry. For the structural analysis of carbohydrates, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) offers precise results, analytical versatility and very high sensitivity. We report herein the rapid and convenient follow-up of chemical reactions, the purity <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>intermediates</b> and final products, and the structural characterization of derivatized maltooligosaccharides, obtained by acidic cleavage (acetolysis) of halogenated and esterified CDs, using ESI-MS in combination with the high-resolution (HRMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) capabilities of a quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer...|$|E
40|$|The current {{paradigm}} in vaccine lot release testing {{is that each}} final lot of vaccine produced is unique, due to the considerable inherent variation in the preceding biological production process. Consequently, each individual vaccine lot needs {{to be tested for}} safety and potency, frequently involving animal experiments. Most of the animal models used for this purpose have been developed in the ‘ 50 s and ‘ 60 s of the previous century and have not changed since. These model are increasingly being criticized {{because of a lack of}} scientific relevance, variability in test results and animal welfare concerns. However, in the last decades many aspects of the production processes, as well as the instruments to monitor and control both the process and its products have improved significantly. A more contemporary strategy for vaccine lot release testing might therefore be to monitor vaccine quality and safety in the context of ensuring consistency in the vaccine production processes. This should be paralleled by extensive characterization of the intermediates and final product; a strategy referred to as the Consistency Approach. For <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>intermediates</b> and final products of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, various physic-chemical and immune-chemical methods, such as gel electrophoresis, chromatography methods, mass spectrometry, are available that enable assessment of antigen composition, antigen conformation, antigen stability, antigen-adjuvant interaction, presence of (im) purities and sterility. In this thesis, cellular in vitro methods were explored for their ability to complement physico-chemical and immune-chemical methods and for their capacity to monitor functional aspects of vaccines - i. e. relevant immunological and safety properties. For our studies we used both routinely produced and experimentally produced Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines. Along with this, the additional value of several existing physico-chemical and immune-chemical methods was investigated, since such techniques had not been evaluated for pertussis vaccines thus far. To examine the potential of these methods as indicators of vaccine quality, the in vivo potencies of our experimental vaccines were assessed, as well as the type and magnitude of immune response induced by these vaccines. The studies in this thesis indicate that in vitro cell-based assays and physico-chemical tools, such as antigen presenting cells, (immunological) reporter cell lines and mass spectrometry can monitor the consistency of pertussis vaccine quality, along with production parameters. In addition, in vivo studies showed that the in vitro immune stimulatory properties of our vaccines coincided with in vivo potencies and in in vivo antibody and T helper cell responses. These results provided a proof-of-principle for the individual components of the consistency approach for B. pertussis vaccines, though it will be necessary to validate each of the methods and the consistency approach as such, and to define a strategy for integrating product and process information. Since the analytical in vitro and in vivo methods described in this thesis assess aspects of vaccine quality that are fundamental for product safety and efficacy, we anticipate that these methods will contribute to the policy to Reduce, Refine and Replace the use of animals (the so-called 3 Rs) in pertussis vaccine lot release testing...|$|E

40|$|International audienceConcepts {{are likely}} to be {{introduced}} in a future C++ standard. They can be used for constraining template parameters, which enables checking requirements on template parameters sooner in the compilation process, and thus providing more intelligible error messages to the user. They can also be used in the specialization of templates, thus leading to a better control over the selection of the most appropriate version of a template for a given instantiation. This latter aspect offers new possibilities in the design of template libraries, as it enhances the specialization mechanism of templates, and set it up as a solid alternative to inheritance when static binding can replace dynamic binding. This report addresses the design of expression templates (i. e. templates that represent expressions and are usually built through operator overloading) that are useful to develop an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), and can speed up the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> an expression by delaying the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>intermediate</b> operations to avoid unnecessary temporary objects.

The one-year cardiac adverse outcomes (cardiac death, myo-cardial infarction or target vessel revascularization) of all the patients and the long-term outcomes of the patients for whom revascularization was deferred according to the FFR were evaluated. Results: The mean percent diameter stenosis was 57 ± 11 % and the FFR was 0. 82 ± 0. 10. Only 25 lesions (23 %) had a FFR < 0. 75. There was no sig-nificant difference in the 1 -year cardiac event rates between the FFR ≥ 0. 75 group and the FFR < 0. 75 group (10. 4 % vs. 13. 0 %, respectively, p= 0. 49).

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the percentage of people in prison over the last fifteen years has led to the advent of a new trend in the correctional system. Intermediate sanctions, sanctions that fall somewhere along a continuum of punishments with prison on one end and probation on the other, have emerged as options for correctional officials looking to reduce overcrowding, reduce costs, and improve recidivism rates for offenders. One of the factors contributing to the overall increase of people incarcerated is the {{dramatic increase}} in the amount of drug offenders imprisoned over the last ten years. More people are engaging in illegal drug activity, and thus, more people are being sent to prison for their involvement in illegal drug activity. The amount of drug crime has not decreased as the percentage of people in prison has increased though. This alarming trend has caused correctional officials to become increasingly interested in any sanction which might reduce the numbers of drug offenders in prison. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>intermediate</b> sanctions, specifically Intensive Supervision Probation, Electronic Monitoring, and Boot Camps, finds that each sanction has the potential to {{have a positive impact on}} the correctional system but not as currently employed. One theme that develops throughout the course <b>of</b> <b>evaluation,</b> though, is the fact that each sanction provides a framework which can be used to develop treatment for drug offenders. These sanctions enable correctional officers to maintain supervision of offenders, while offenders receive treatment for their addiction. Reducing the numbers of addicted offenders can reduce the amount of crime, thus decreasing the number of people in prison. Intermediate sanctions that contribute to the rehabilitation of offenders, contribute to the decrease in the amount of people in prison. Therein lies their value in the correctional system, and provides justification for their continual development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Evolutionary Computation is {{not only}} widely used in {{optimization}} and machine learning, but also being applied in creating novel structures and entities. This paper proposes evolutionary topic maps that can suggest new and creative knowledge not easily producible by humans. Interactive evolutionary computation method is applied into topic maps in order to accept human <b>evaluation</b> on feasibility <b>of</b> <b>intermediate</b> topic maps. Evolutionary topic maps are creativity support tools, helping users to encounter new and creative knowledge. Further work can greatly improve the system by providing more operations, preventing over-convergence, and overcoming user fatigue problem by providing mor...|$|R
40|$|N-acyloxyalkylation of NH-acidic {{compounds}} {{can be a}} prodrug {{approach for}} e. g. tertiary or some N-heterocyclic amines and secondary amides and {{have the potential to}} modify the properties of the parent drug for specific uses, for example its physicochemical, pharmacokinetic or biopharmaceutical properties. Aripiprazole lauroxil was prepared as a model compound for such prodrugs and its bioconversion was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Theoretically, N-acyloxyalkyl derivates of NH-acid compounds undergo a two-step bioconversion into the parent NH-acidic drug through an N-hydroxyalkyl intermediate. However, to our knowledge no published studies have investigated the formation <b>of</b> an <b>intermediate</b> in vivo. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the assumed N-hydroxymethyl intermediate was readily observed both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the observed plasma concentration <b>of</b> the <b>intermediate</b> was at the same level as the drug (aripiprazole). When prodrug intermediates are formed, it is important to make a proper pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>intermediates</b> to ensure patient safety; however, several challenges were identified when testing an N-acyloxyalkyl prodrug. These included the development of a suitable bioanalytical method, the accurate prediction of prodrug bioconversion and thereby the related pharmacokinetics in humans and the toxicological potential <b>of</b> the <b>intermediate...</b>|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This paper {{describes}} the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> an <b>intermediate</b> obstetric ultrasound and emergency medicine ultrasound education workshop for rural and remote Australian doctors, which {{was developed in}} response to an educational needs assessment that showed an unmet need in this area. The workshop was held in four Australian states. The participants were 61 rural and remote doctors. METHODS: Data from pre- and post-workshop knowledge tests and general workshop evaluation were analysed. RESULTS: Sixty-one doctors attended an ultrasound workshop and self-reported increases in knowledge, confidence and expertise in ultrasound. The mean pretest score for 56 doctors who completed both the pre- and post-workshop knowledge tests was 31. 6 and the post-test score mean was 33. 3 out of a possible score of 44, which demonstrated a statistically significant increase in knowledge (P = 0. 003). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the workshop demonstrated that it was an effective way of increasing knowledge and confidence in intermediate obstetric ultrasound and emergency medicine ultrasound. The workshop was popular and received very positive feedback from the attendees...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA plasma-retining {{technique}} {{is applied to}} upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG) to produce solar grade silicon for multi-c silicon ingots at direct costs lower than 15 €/kg. Using oxygen and hydrogen as reactive gases injected in the plasma, boron {{is removed from the}} material mainly in form of BOH and BO. The boron volatili- Zation time has been reduced to 50 min compared to previous processes, by increasing the temperature of the silicon bath. At the same time, the Al, Ca, C, O concentrations are strongly reduced. From a Íirst batch of puritied UMG Silicon, multi-crystalline ingots (l 2 kg), wafers (125 X 125 mm 2) and solar cells have been produced for an <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> this <b>intermediate</b> material. The obtained solar cells gave efticiencies of up to ll. 7 %. Process development towards an up-scaled pilot equipment is on the Way to further increase the puritication efticiency...|$|R
