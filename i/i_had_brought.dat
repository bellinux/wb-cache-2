2500|$|After {{returning}} to Pine Ridge in 1905, Standing Bear {{was chosen as}} a chief of the Oglala Lakota on July 4, 1905. There was a great celebration. “In different places they started to sing songs of praise for me. [...] Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> along. I kept this up until I had given away everything I owned, and my wife and I walked away with practically nothing. [...] We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Freeman {{was a man}} of {{deeply held}} convictions, which he expounded in the History of the Norman Conquest and other works with vigour and enthusiasm. [...] These {{included}} the belief, common to many thinkers of his generation, in the superiority of those peoples that spoke Indo-European languages, especially the Greek, Roman and Germanic peoples, and in their genetic cousinhood; also in the purely Teutonic nature of the English nation. [...] He asserted that the Anglo-Saxon invaders of England had largely killed or driven out the original Celtic inhabitants, though he admitted that [...] "the women would doubtless be largely spared", an exception which fatally flawed his argument. His conviction of the racial purity of the Anglo-Saxon people was highly influential on later generations of writers. [...] His enthusiasm for Anglo-Saxondom knew few bounds when it came to their social and political institutions, and to his greatest heroes. [...] These included Alfred the Great, Earl Godwin and Harold Godwinson, though he also began increasingly to admire William for his policy of protecting his revolution by retaining Old English institutions wherever possible. [...] Freeman placed much greater faith in Anglo-Saxon historical writings than in the Norman chronicles, which he considered vitiated by sycophancy to the Norman court. [...] He had learned from Thomas Arnold a belief in the continuous and cyclical nature of history in general. [...] Taking his cue from Francis Palgrave, Freeman applied this to early medieval history by making the thoroughly Whig claim that the first parliaments of the reigns of Henry III and Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> the country back to something like the Anglo-Saxon institution of the Witenagemot, or national council, and that the constitution of the country had evolved through the Conquest period rather than being entirely remade. [...] An unbroken line thus connected the Witenagemot with Victorian democracy. [...] This all had the effect of diminishing the significance of his own subject, since it meant that 1066 had for Freeman [...] "not the importance either of a beginning or of an ending, but the importance of a turning point". [...] Hammering the point home, he wrote that, ...|$|E

60|$|Clive. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> it for you. It is {{not very}} good.
