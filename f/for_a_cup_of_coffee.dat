5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E
5|$|While at the dentist, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads {{an article}} about China's growing global power, and he decides that China must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E

The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> or tea can make a real difference.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos's {{execution}} {{took place}} on October 9, 2002. She died at 9:47a.m. EDT. She declined her last meal {{which could have been}} anything under $20 and opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> instead. Her last words were, [...] "Yes, I would just like to say I'm sailing with the rock, and I'll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I'll be back, I'll be back." [...] She was the tenth woman in the United States and the second in Florida to be executed since the 1976 Supreme Court decision restoring capital punishment.|$|E

60|$|The elder Mavering {{had been}} trying, without success, {{to think of}} {{something}} to say to Miss Pasmer, he had twice cleared his throat for that purpose. But this comedy between his son and the young lady's mother seemed so much lighter and brighter than anything he could have said, that he said nothing, and looked on with his mouth set in its queer smile, while the girl listened with the gravity of a daughter who sees that her mother is losing her head. Mrs. Pasmer buzzed on in her badinage with the young man, and allowed him to go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> before she rose from her chair, and shook out her skirts with an air of pleasant expectation of whatever should come next.|$|E

She came down early <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and the landlady told her that Mr. Dickerson had just gone; he wished Mrs. Montgomery to give Cornelia his respects, and apologize for his going away without waiting to see her again. He had really expected to stay over till Monday, but he found he could save several days by taking the Chicago Limited that morning. Mrs. Montgomery praised his energy; she did not believe he would be on the road a great while longer; he would be in the firm in less than another year. She hinted at his past unhappiness in the married state, and she said she did hope that he would get somebody who would appreciate him, next time. There {{did not seem to be}} any doubt in her mind that there would be a next time with him.|$|E

60|$|As we {{drew near}} Civita Vecchia the sea widened on our view, wild with a wind {{that seemed to}} have been blowing ever since the stormy evening in 1865 when, after looking at the tossing ships in the harbor, we decided to take the {{diligence}} for Leghorn, rather than the little steamer we had meant to take. From our pleasant train we now patronized Civita Vecchia with a recognition of its picturesqueness, unvexed by the choice that then insisted on itself, though the harbor was as full of shipping as of old. There was time to run out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> at the station buffet, where there had been neither station nor buffet in our young time: but doubtless then as now there had been the lonely graveyard outside the town, with its sea-beaten, seaward wall. We buried there the last of our Roman holidays under a sky that had changed from blue to gray since our journey began, and mournfully set out faces northward in the malarial Maremma.|$|E
6000|$|When Hewson {{read this}} Story (and {{it seemed to}} him that no means of {{bringing}} it to his notice at the club, and on the street, and by mail was left unemployed), he had two thoughts: one was of St. John, and one was of Miss Hernshaw. In all his exploitations of his experience he had carefully, he thought religiously, concealed the scene, except that one only time when Miss Hernshaw suddenly got it out of him by that demand of hers, [...] "Was it that morning at St. Johnswort when you got up so early and went <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> at the inn?" [...] He had confided so absolutely in her that his admission had not troubled him at the time, and it had not troubled him since, till now when he found the fact given this hideous publicity, and knew that it could have become known only through her: through her who had seemed to make herself the protectress of his apparition and to guard it with indignation even against his own slight! ...|$|E
60|$|He got to London {{just in time}} {{to reach}} the bank before it was closed, and there made his arrangements. He {{deposited}} his documents and securities, and was assured that the necessary sum should be placed to his credit on the following day. Then he walked across a street or two in the City to the place indicated by Bollum for the appointment. It was at the Jericho Coffee House, in Levant Court,--a silent, secluded spot, lying between Lombard Street and Cornhill. Here he found himself ten minutes before the time, and, asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> sat down at a table fixed to the ground in a little separate box. The order was given to a young woman at a bar in the room. Then an ancient waiter hobbled up to him and explained that coffee was not quite ready. In truth, coffee was not often asked for at the Jericho Coffee House. The house, said the waiter, was celebrated for its sherry. Would he take half a pint of sherry? So he ordered the sherry, which was afterwards drunk by Bollum.|$|E

The Colonel did his best to remedy the default of lining {{as soon as it was}} borne in upon him that the affair would not begin at once, and so well did he succeed that the coffee was just ready when - the men moved off, their Band leading. Even then there had been a mistake in time, and the Fore and Aft came out into the valley ten minutes before the proper hour. Their Band wheeled to the right after reaching the open, and retired behind a little rocky knoll still playing while the Regiment went past.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well; I suppose it's all right,' said Melmotte, {{rising and}} going back to his seat. But he knew that things were not all right. Had his {{political}} friends only been absent, he might have attributed their absence to some political cause which would not have touched him deeply. But the treachery of the Lord Mayor and of Sir Gregory Gribe was a blow. For another hour after he had returned to his place, the Emperor sat solemn in his chair; and then, at some signal given by some one, he was withdrawn. The ladies had already left the room about half an hour. According to the programme arranged for the evening, the royal guests were to return to the smaller room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and were then to be paraded upstairs before the multitude who would by that time have arrived, and to remain there long enough to justify the invited ones in saying that they had spent the evening with the Emperor and the Princes and the Princesses. The plan was carried out perfectly. At half-past ten the Emperor was made to walk upstairs, and for half an hour sat awful and composed in an arm-chair that had been prepared for him. How one would wish to see the inside of the mind of the Emperor as it worked on that occasion! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At 1:30 A.M., on Thursday, 3rd February, as {{the moon}} rose we saddled our mules and pushed forward at a rapid pace. At 4 A.M. we halted and had {{a cup of coffee}} each, when we again mounted. As the day broke we came upon an encampment of the Debeneh, who hearing the clatter of our mules' hoofs, set up the cry of alarm. The Bedoo pacified them: they had {{supposed}} us to be a party of Eesa. We continued our journey, and about 10 A.M. we halted for breakfast, which consisted of coffee and parched grain. At noon we again moved forward, and at 3 P.M., having arrived at a pool of water called Murhabr in the Wady Dalabayah, we halted for about an hour to make some bread. We then continued through the Wady, passed several Bedoo encampments till a little after dark, when we descended into the plain of Gurgudeli. Here observing several fires, the Bedoo crawled along to reconnoitre, and returned to say they were Debeneh. We gave them a wide berth, and about 8:30 P.M. halted. We were cautioned not to make a fire, but I had a great desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> after the fatigue of this long march. Accordingly we made a small fire, concealing it with shields.|$|E
