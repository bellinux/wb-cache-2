Several prey-capture (attack <b>distance,</b> <b>mean</b> attack velocity, capture time, and gape cycle duration) and anti-predator (reaction <b>distance,</b> response <b>distance,</b> <b>mean</b> velocity, and maximum velocity) performance varia-bles were quantified using high-speed video for juvenile red drum (25 – 30 mm standard length, LS) reared with and without predators (pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides). Univariate contrasts of prey-capture events demonstrated that attack <b>distance</b> (<b>mean</b> ± s. e.) was significantly greater in red drum reared with (1. 20 ± 0. 16 mm) versus without (0. 65 ± 0. 09 mm) pinfish predators. During anti-predator events, red drum reared with predators had approximately 300 % greater reaction distance and 20 %– 30 % greater response <b>distance,</b> <b>mean</b> velocity and maximum velocity versus fish reared without predators; however, these differences were not statistically signif-icant. Following video assessments, a series of mortality experiments were conducted using free-ranging pinfish predators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved positioning approach for cellular-network based mobile tracking in severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation environments. The proposed approach {{consists of two}} stages: the smoothing stage to suppress the NLOS errors in the distance measurements; and the position tracking stage. An improved distance smoothing method is proposed to significantly reduce the NLOS errors. It applies online <b>distance</b> <b>mean</b> and variance estimates to identify LOS and NLOS propagations. The online LOS and NLOS identification results, the <b>distance</b> <b>mean</b> and variance estimates are employed to update the Kalman filter (KF) for smoothing distance measurements. A data fusion technique is developed to combine distance measurements, mobile velocity and heading angle estimates provided by motion sensors through the extended KF. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach significantly improves position accuracy compared to the existing NLOS mitigation algorithms, {{at the cost of}} increased computational complexity. 5 page(s...|$|R
