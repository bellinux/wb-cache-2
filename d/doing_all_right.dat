2500|$|According to Robert Giroux, [...] "The studios {{seemed to}} be fearful that if {{certain aspects of the}} case were exposed, it would {{exacerbate}} their problems." [...] King Vidor said of the case in 1968: [...] "Last year I interviewed a Los Angeles police detective, now retired, who had been assigned to the case immediately after the murder. He told me, 'We were <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and then, before a week was out, we got the word to lay off.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote, [...] "Cumberland's {{greatest}} individual play of {{the game}} occurred when fullback Allen circled right end for a 6yard loss." [...] At halftime, Heisman reportedly told his players, [...] "You're <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> team, we're ahead. But you just can't tell what those Cumberland players have up their sleeves. They may spring a surprise. Be alert, men! Hit 'em clean, but hit 'em hard!" [...] However, even Heisman relented, and shortened the quarters in the second half to 12 minutes each instead of 15.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks." [...] She smiled. [...] "You {{seem to be}} <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> too. Commander Gross {{tells me}} that you're {{responsible}} for this project, Operation Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{did their}} job well. Especially lately, {{with the new}} designs coming up. Now they {{repaired}} themselves. They were on their own. Radiation tabs protected the UN troops, but if a man lost his tab he was fair game for the claws, no matter what his uniform. Down below the surface automatic machinery stamped them out. Human beings stayed a long way off. It was too risky; nobody wanted to be around them. They were left to themselves. And {{they seemed to be}} <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> The new designs were faster, more complex. More efficient.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{always say}} that," [...] he complained; [...] "and it isn't nonsense. What's {{the point of}} having a garden if one can't watch birds in it? The street <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> for hoops. And if {{children}} can't be trusted in the streets, their mothers should keep them at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{truth of}} the matter is, Benson, I wanted you here. You brought Joe and Darry to the fort, and those two boys need looking after. We {{are going to have a}} fight, sooner or later. We may win, and if we <b>do,</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> But if we don't----" ...|$|R
60|$|On the Saturday evening this 'ere Cauliflower public-'ouse was crowded, {{everybody}} being {{anxious to}} see the watch trick done over agin.

6000|$|... “I {{sent that}} letter to Dravot,” said Carnehan; “and {{told him to}} come back because this Kingdom was growing too big for me to handle, and then I struck for the first valley, to see how the priests were working. They called the village we took along with the Chief, Bashkai, and the first village we took, Er-Heb. The priest at Er-Heb was <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but {{they had a lot of}} pending cases about land to show me, and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night. I went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a {{thousand}} yards. That used all the cartridges I cared to spend, and I waited for Dravot, who had been away two or three months, and I kept my people quiet.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewer John Crosby, in a March 31 1955 article {{entitled}} [...] "Pond's Theatre Delivers Satisfying Dramatic Fare" [...] commented that: [...] "Pond's Theater doesn't do that well because its on a Thursday, and because it's on ABC-TV,which can't deliver the stations. But it <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and {{in less than}} three months has done some, very interesting plays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't {{make any}} difference," [...] said Bessie, [...] "and I'll {{try to be}} quiet and <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> if you'll just let me have my child again.

50|$|There were slight {{differences}} between the UK, US and Japanese tour. The Japanese shows were a bit longer (Queen even played <b>Doing</b> <b>All</b> <b>Right</b> and See What A Fool I've Been sometimes as well as Hangman on the final night of the tour), possibly due to the warm welcome they received from the Japanese fans.|$|E

5000|$|Danny McNamara {{had told}} XFM that Coldplay lead singer, {{and friend of}} McNamara, Chris Martin, was fond of Embrace {{compared}} to the band's earlier material. McNamara said that [...] "When he heard our third album, he didn't like it at all. This album he was like 'Wow'.

6000|$|... "I'd {{like to be}} one {{of those}} fellows who sit in offices, and sign checks, and tell the office-boy to tell Mr. Rockerfeller they can give him five minutes.

5000|$|Marshall {{returns to}} the bar {{to write a letter}} to himself 29 years further in the future. In the letter, he makes a small request for his future self to let him know if time travel exists. Lily {{returns to the}} booth with a free plate of hot wings, which she says someone [...] "sent back" [...] because they were too hot. Marshall {{finishes}} the letter, telling Future Marshall that so long as he is still with Lily he will be <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> As it turns out, an older version of Marshall {{is on the other side}} of the bar, who apologizes to Wendy the Waitress for sending the wings back, saying he [...] "already had some wings earlier... much earlier".|$|E

5000|$|Coach Schembechler denied {{there was}} any controversy, and Taylor {{returned}} to the line-up in the fifth game against Iowa. Taylor was impressive in his return, completing 11 of 15 pass attempts, including 2 touchdown passes, and also scored a rushing touchdown as the Wolverines beat the Hawkeyes 26 - 12. After the game, Taylor said, [...] "I think I <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> I took what the defense gave me." ...|$|R
5000|$|We had appalling press at the time. Nobody {{seemed to}} want to know us for one reason or another. We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was going on about us as another hyped British band. We couldn't believe it. In our naivety we thought we'd done a good album and were <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and then this venom comes flying out. We couldn't {{understand}} why or what we'd done to them. After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation. We avoided them and so they avoided us. It was only because {{we did a lot of}} shows that our reputation got around as a good live band.|$|E
5000|$|Cienfuegos' and Guevara's columns {{reached the}} central provinces, where they {{combined}} their efforts with other groups. Cienfuegos' column attacked an army outpost at Yaguajay and, after a tough fight, forced the garrison to surrender on 30 December 1958. This {{earned him the}} nickname [...] "The Hero of Yaguajay." [...] Cienfuegos then advanced against Santa Clara in conjunction with Guevara's forces, and the other non-Castro forces from the Escambray front. Together, the two columns captured Santa Clara on 31 December. Most of the defenders surrendered without firing their weapons. Batista fled Cuba the next day, leaving the guerrilla fighters victorious. At a rally on 8 January 1959, Castro interrupted his speech to ask Cienfuegos [...] "¿Voy bien, Camilo?" [...] ("Am I <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> Camilo?") His response [...] "Vas bien, Fidel" [...] ("You're doing fine, Fidel") was {{taken up by the}} crowd and became a slogan of the revolution.|$|E
5000|$|On his {{departure}} from the group, Sandom said, [...] "I wasn't so ambitious {{as the rest of}} them. I'd done it longer than what they had. Of course, I loved it. It was very nice {{to be part of a}} band that people followed, it was great. But I didn't get on well with Peter Townshend. I was a few years older than he was, and he thought I should pack it in more or less because of that. I thought I was <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with the band, we never got slung out of nowhere, we always passed our auditions." [...] According to Townshend's book Who I Am, Sandom was hurt by Townshend's comments that he should leave as a few months earlier, when The Who had failed an audition because a record executive thought Pete Townshend was [...] "gangly, noisy, and ugly", Sandom had defended Townshend.|$|E
