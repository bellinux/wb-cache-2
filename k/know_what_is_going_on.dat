[...] Realizing Kenneth might <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with the TGS auditions, Jenna floats towards him with the wind in her hair, and when Kenneth sees her he calls her [...] "Vampyr!". Later, Jenna reveals to Liz that she has been brought into auditions, similar to what Liz and Pete are doing with rigging the TGS auditions, to make actress Kim Cattrall seem grounded and human.|$|E

[...] One after another, MIKE turns each away.

One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going). Eddie expresses his discontent with being kept out of the secret and affirms to Locke his desire to be in on [...] "whatever you guys are trying to blow up". Locke laughs and says he will talk to the commune leaders, Mike (Chris Mulkey) and Jan (Virginia Morris).|$|E

500|$|Under James Elverson, The Philadelphia Inquirer declared, [...] "the new Inquirer {{shall be}} {{in all respects}} a complete, enterprising, {{progressive}} newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit {{of the time and}} behind in nothing of interest to people who want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions..." [...] During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared [...] "Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World." [...] At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water. The newspaper continued similar politics under Elverson Jr., and by the 1920s The Inquirer became known as the [...] "Republican Bible of Pennsylvania".|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill's first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term [...] "iron curtain" [...] came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President Harry S. Truman regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating [...] "n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> behind". He was further concerned about [...] "another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe". Churchill concluded [...] "then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{afterward}} {{about his}} one-day presidency, Carmona told The Miami Herald {{that he had}} been [...] "misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command," [...] whereas if the coup had [...] "been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made." [...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope." [...] Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a [...] "civic activist" [...] but would leave politics: [...] "I have never been a politician; that is not my world," [...] Carmona said. [...] "As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle." ...|$|E
