A simple computer program {{was developed to}} simulate airflow through a wind tower based on tower dimensions and air temperature. The program was compared to experimental results with reasonable agreement. Parametric analysis indicates that interior air temperature approaches outdoor air temperature asymptotically as tower height and cross-sectional area are increased, and {{that it may be}} more cost effective to increase the tower?s height than its cross sectional area.

40|$|A method {{based on}} the ASHRAE two-node comfort model has been {{developed}} for predicting the effect of windows on thermal comfort. The method embodies separate analyses for long-wave (thermal infrared) radiation, <b>induced</b> <b>drafts,</b> and solar load effects. Of these three impacts, modeling results demonstrate that long-wave exchange between {{the body and the}} window is the most significant except for the case where the body is in direct sun, in which case the impact solar load can be more significant. For most residential-size windows, draft effects exist but are typically small. Generally, windows are not the primary element affecting the comfort of a building’s occupants. However when a window is very hot or cold, the occupant is very close to the window, or other factors result in thermal conditions {{near the edge of the}} comfort zone, windows can become quite influential. Furthermore it is believed that current methods may under-predict discomfort caused by windows. We discuss potential refinements to the method that might address this inaccuracy by accounting for asymmetries in radiant temperature. In the near term, the model could be used to create a simplified “window comfort index. ” To accompany the index, we envision educational material that would educate designers and consumers on the comfort implications of glazing selection...|$|R

25|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{circulating}} cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain {{the ability of the}} water to cool as it circulates.

25|$|Forced draught — A {{mechanical}} draft tower with {{a blower}} type fan at the intake. The fan forces {{air into the}} tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities.

50|$|Unlike wood stoves which operate {{exclusively}} on {{a principle of}} chimney draft, a pellet stove must use specially sealed exhaust pipe to prevent exhaust gases escaping into the living space due to the air pressure produced by a combustion blower. Pellet stoves require certified double walled venting, normally three or four inches in diameter with a stainless steel interior and galvanized exterior. Because pellet stoves have a forced exhaust system, they {{have the advantage of}} not always requiring a vertical rise to vent, although a 3 to 5 ft vertical run to <b>induce</b> some <b>draft</b> is recommended to prevent leakage {{in the case of a}} power outage. Like a modern gas appliance, pellet stoves can be vented horizontally through an outside wall and terminated below the roof line, making it an excellent choice for structures without an existing chimney. If an existing chimney is available, manufacturers urge use of a correctly sized stainless steel liner the length of the chimney for proper drafting. Modern building techniques have created tightly sealed homes, forcing many pellet stove manufacturers to recommend their stoves be installed with outside air intake to ensure the stoves will run efficiently and prevent potential negative pressure within the home.|$|R

Under the version labeled the “reasonable-shot” rule, the court would resolve the battle of the forms by choosing the form that contains the more efficient terms. The paper proposes some guidelines how the “reasonable shot” could be identified by the court, and argues that there are good reasons to expect that this regime would give parties the incentive to draft reasonable terms.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{issues related}} to the efficiency and effectiveness of government policies to provide public goods. In the first essay, I develop an empirical test for whether police officers discriminate on driver gender when enforcing traffic laws. The test is designed to only detect discrimination that is unrelated to providing safe conditions on the roads. The empirical method developed in the essay may be applicable {{in a number of other}} contexts where evaluators (such as police officers, judges, or mortgage lenders) may potentially discriminate when making decisions regarding subjects who belong to different demographic groups. The second essay makes a theoretical argument showing that because police officers can detect many different crimes by making a traffic stop, the widespread practice of giving stopped traffic law violators a warning instead of a fine can be efficient. Warnings would at first seem to be inefficient because they lower the expected penalty from breaking the law, and thereby reduce deterrence for a given amount of public resources devoted to detecting and stopping violations. My argument therefore points out an efficiency rationale for providing individual government agents discretion in deciding which detected law breakers to penalize. In the third and final essay, my co-author Daniel Eisenberg and I use the Vietnam draft lottery to test the commonly held presumption that smoking as a young person strongly predicts smoking in later adulthood. This presumption, well documented by many observational studies, underlies many anti-smoking policies in the United States. Yet some of the persistence of smoking over time might be attributable to individual factors, such as tolerance for health risks, which are difficult to account for in observational data. Using variation in smoking <b>induced</b> by the <b>draft</b> lottery, we do not find a strong relationship between smoking in early and late adulthood, suggesting that anti-smoking policies directed at young people may not be effective in achieving the policy goal of reducing adult smoking rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{concerns}} {{of global warming}} are guiding most industries and commercial properties towards addressing their energy usage. In large buildings where air conditioning is required, {{there is often a}} need for “chillers” to control the temperature of the building. This process is not environmentally friendly and expensive in terms of energy used and maintenance issues. The alternative is to cool buildings using natural resources such as <b>induced</b> wind <b>drafts</b> and water extraction from rivers and canal. The latter has not been used with optimum effectiveness because the prediction procedures are not sufficiently developed to satisfy environmental legislation. The mathematical approaches are unrealistic and extremely conservative in their analysis and this causes many valid proposals to be rejected. This research is aimed at addressing that situation. It will provide a valid interactive 3 -dimensional analysis procedure that will better evaluate the potential of using any British Waterways canal or similar water source for cooling purposes. After water has been used for cooling it is returned to the canal in a heated state as a thermal plume. It is the boundaries of the plume that must be predicted with reasonable accuracy so that environmental legislation is not infringed and livestock is not jeopardised. It is equally important to ensure the analysis is not over sensitive so as to result in rejection of valid proposals. Earlier work studied heat distribution but did not consider the thermal discharge into still and shallow water, as in a British Waterways canal. The studies below investigate several canal sites to evaluate a variety of situations where the discharge plume differs. Criteria including discharge direction, volume of water, temperature differences, speed of discharge and depth of discharge pipe all play a part {{in the formation of the}} plume. As such it is possible to develop an understanding of how the thermal plume merges into the still water and how the heat is diffused into the general body of water. In conjunction with site measurements a laboratory experimental scale model tank was built to replicate the real canal site. This allowed data to be varied and measured more readily. Two different types of discharge have been the subject of this research - the first being when the discharge pipe is located at the surface of the receiving water, the second being when it is submerged deeply below the surface. In all cases the temperature and velocity are measured at various points and at a variety of depths to provide a three dimensional plot across the mixing zone. In addition to the mathematical analysis, thermal imaging was used to predict the heat diffusion profiles on the surface of the receiving water in both the canal site and the model tank. CFD software is also used to evaluate the distribution of temperature and velocity within the mixing zone. The mathematical analysis produced an equation to predict the heat diffusion profile in surface discharge. And a number of equations were produced to model the plume path line in submerged discharge- relating to temperature and velocity dilution along and across the path lines. The relative effects of the bed and free surface proximity appeared significantly in the equations. A 3 -dimensional model of the size of the plume is presented to demonstrate the results. The procedure followed in this study will enable the Environment Agency personnel to assess the waste heat utilization with greater thoroughness and within a shorter period.

40|$|One {{strategy}} to remove anthropogenic CO₂ {{from the atmosphere}} to mitigate climate change is by direct ocean injection. Liquid CO₂ can react with seawater to form solid partially reacted CO₂ hydrate composite particles (pure hydrate plus unreacted CO₂ and water) with densities several percent above ambient seawater. The most recent field injections at depths of 1500 m in Monterey Canyon resulted in long curved cylinders with diameters - 2. 5 cm and lengths up to - 1 m that were observed to sink at - 4 cm/s. This thesis examines whether releasing the partially reacted hydrate particles into the ocean at - 100 kg/s of CO₂ (roughly the output of one 500 MW coal power plant) is able to create sufficient dilution to minimize the impact on marine life. We developed a drag coefficient model for cylindrical particles in free fall. Applying the new drag coefficient model to recently observed field injections to predict their descent, the recently produced field particles were estimated {{to have had a}} ~ 16 % reaction efficiency and to have sunk 100 m before completely dissolving. Ambient density stratification and currents will also affect particle descent, and in turn the dilution of dissolved CO₂. Three methods of injection of composite particles were evaluated, each with unique merits. Firstly, we can release hydrate particles (with a range of reaction efficiencies) continuously from a moving ship. This is shown to provide excellent dilution of the discharged CO₂. Second, we can release them from a stationary pipe to create a plume that generally sinks further than individual particles. (cont.) However we show numerically that, while this method appears to be the most practical from an engineering standpoint, the dilutions and sequestration depths are highly dependent on ambient conditions. The third method involves constructing a shroud around a fixed source to shelter the plume from effects of ambient stratification and current. The shroud also serves as an inverted chimney, <b>inducing</b> a down <b>draft</b> that transports the dissolving particles to a depth of lower ambient distur-bance. Laboratory measurements using particle image velocimetry (PIV) shows that the induced flow depends on the shroud length and diameter, as well as the particle buoyancy and size. by Aaron C. Chow.

40|$|Metal {{curtain walls}} {{are widely used}} in {{commercial}} buildings and offer many advantages including space saving, high quality in manufacturing, light weight, significant aesthetic freedom, and rapid construction. However, their thermal performance is still low {{due to the fact}} that metal curtain walls consist of a large portion of glazing, and glass and metal are high heat conductors. In practice, metal curtain walls are referred to as "heat sink" in heating-dominant climate. The relatively low thermal resistance results in low surface temperature in cold winter, and thus may cause condensation and thermal discomfort problems in addition to high energy consumption. Initially, metal curtain walls grew within metal window industry and the current methodology and standards developed for evaluating window performance are also used for curtain walls. However, metal curtain walls differ from windows in that they have a much larger continuous glazing portion, more complex configuration and heat flow at the joints. Their overall performance depends on the interaction and integration of individual constituents as well as the performance of each component. However, the assessment of curtain wall performance by existing standards is segmented and no study has addressed the overall thermal performance of curtain walls by treating them as integrated systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the overall thermal performance of metal curtain walls using a developed holistic approach for the purpose of providing technical information on the improvement of curtain wall design. A comprehensive research program has been designed and implemented to establish the overall performance of curtain walls by experimental testing, analytical and simulation studies. For the first time, extensive experimental testing has been conducted on full-scale specimen under field conditions reproduced in a large-scale environmental chamber. The two-story full-size specimen (3. 8 m by 6. 7 m) includes two commercially available curtain wall systems with different design details. The experimental program includes: (1) full-scale air leakage test, (2) thermal performance test, (3) measurement of local convection film coefficient, and, (4) measurement of local <b>draft</b> <b>induced</b> by curtain wall cold surface. The analytical and simulation studies include: (1) effect of design details on thermal transmittance using the simulation program FRAME, (2) effect of local film coefficients on the condensation resistance prediction using the simulation program FRAME, (3) effect of thermal performance of curtain walls on occupant thermal comfort and on energy consumption. Results from extensive testing and simulations have revealed the intricate links among the components, the overall wall assembly performance and the impact on the energy use and indoor comfort; and, therefore, provided solid technical information for manufacturers on the productive direction of future R&D and for designers on the selection of curtain wall systems to achieve energy-efficient buildings with healthy and comfort indoor environment.

40|$|Wave induced {{vibrations}} in {{the ship}} hull girder have become a concern with the rapidly increasing size and structural flexibility of container vessels since it increases both ultimate loading and fatigue damage. Damping of the hull girder reduces the vibrations after a wave impact and the resonance level from steady state vibrations. The effect, magnitude and origin of the damping are however not well defined in current classification guidelines regarding wave <b>induced</b> vibrations. Speed, <b>draft,</b> ship size, natural frequency and response amplitude are parameters that possibly could influence the damping. It’s difficult to isolate the importance of each parameter on the damping from full scale measurements since the effects are coupled. A better approximation of the damping leads to more accurate assessment of ultimate loading and fatigue damage from wave induced vibrations. This thesis aims to evaluate and find an accurate and robust method to estimate the total damping from full scale stress measurements of ships and to investigate how the damping affects the ultimate and fatigue strength of a ship. There are different methods to estimate damping, mainly divided into time domain and frequency domain methods. Six different methods were benchmarked with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to damping ratio, natural frequency, sample length and sampling frequency. The possibility to implement the methods in hull stress monitoring systems on board the vessels is also investigated. The benchmark study included two methods implemented in the commercial software ARTeMIS modal pro. The evaluation process was done on artificially created stress signals from single-degree-of-freedom systems where the damping ratio and natural frequencies could be predefined. The influence of damping on the fatigue damage was evaluated using rainflow counting (RFC), the Basquin equation and the Palmgren-Miner accumulation rule on the synthesized stress signal. The damping showed to have a considerable effect on the fatigue damage calculated on the high frequency part of the stress signal; by doubling the damping ratio, the vibrational damage can be reduced by up to 88 %. The damping is more effective on reducing the fatigue damage for ships with lower natural frequencies, i. e. longer ship. The model does not consider wave frequency stresses and is therefore not applicable on physical problems. Regarding ultimate loading, the damping reduces the vibrational part of the stresses that are superimposed on the total stresses. The results were used to formulate a suggestion for a revised rule text regarding wave induced vibrations for DNV GL. By including {{the effects of a}} higher damping than expected, the ultimate loading assessment can be reduced and vice versa. Full scale measurement data from 14 container vessels, 2 LNG carriers, 3 ore carriers and 2 tankers were investigated. Dependencies between damping ratio and other parameters, such as, size, speed, response and ship type were evaluated. The results were scattered and no clear correlations could be found, save for a moderate correlation between the response amplitude and the damping. Ship size didn’t show any clear correlation, but type of vessel showed a distinct difference between slender container vessels and blunt ore carriers/LNG-carriers/oil tankers. It was concluded that container vessels generally have a damping ratio between 1. 5 and 2 %, while the blunt vessels generally lie between 0. 5 and 1 % damping ratio...|$|R
