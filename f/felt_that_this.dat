5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was merely a}} display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a {{way that}} was {{meaningful}} to the lowliest Indians. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an earlier version of the script to the point that he considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E
500|$|Farr <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> story, the Thom(p)sons [...] "have {{a splendid}} adventure" [...] {{with the various}} {{scenarios}} that they get into.|$|R
60|$|Bessie <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> after <b>this</b> {{she must}} like the sweet child, though {{sweetness}} {{did not seem}} to her the predominant feature in Arthurine.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Margaret curtly, for she {{was still}} very wrathful, and vaguely <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> at <b>this</b> stage, all {{references}} to the Duke were somehow treasonable.|$|R
5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency {{in the way in which}} decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have I the {{pleasure}} of addressing Mr Buck MacGinnis?' I said. I <b>felt</b> convinced <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could be no other than that celebrity.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. March <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> all <b>this</b> was {{weakening}} her moral fibre; but {{she tried}} {{to draw the line}} at letting Burnamy keep the group. [...] "Why not?" [...] he pleaded.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] cried Sylvia. Instinctively she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> under <b>this</b> troubled surface some evil {{thing was}} stirring, {{that the issues}} perhaps were not quite as simple as she had deemed them.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per this bill, trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete {{power over the}} administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some sections of the assembly which <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an intrusion in the religious affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern over some of its provisions.|$|E
5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair. He was {{under pressure from the}} U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
60|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances {{he would}} have spoken to his father, but he <b>felt</b> instinctively <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a matter on which Coppy ought first to be consulted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Madeline. But she <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>this</b> matter, {{her father}} was more surely her friend than her mother. And indeed she could {{understand}} her mother's opposition to poor Felix, much better than her father's acquiescence.|$|R
60|$|But Marzak <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> matter {{his mother}} was to be supported, whilst his detestation of this adventurer who {{threatened}} to usurp the place that should rightly be his own spurred him to mad lengths of daring.|$|R
5|$|Reviews {{were widely}} varied for the episode: some {{felt it was}} the best of the third season to date, and others were quite critical, though the overall mix was {{somewhat}} more positive than negative. A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes have tended to be light on plot, though several <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath was the {{location}} of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
60|$|She <b>felt</b> assured <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would lead}} to their discovery; but it had quite the {{opposite}} effect, for it caused Swankie to turn round and examine the trinket with much curiosity.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{felt ashamed}} if people watched {{television}} {{and saw what}} was happening in our Dewan. In my heart, I also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> all <b>this</b> happened because there was a live broadcast at that time," [...] said the Prime Minister.|$|R
50|$|Justice Cardozo's {{concurring opinion}} {{clarified}} that a spectrum approach to {{direct and indirect}} effects is preferable to a strict dichotomy. Cardozo <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> case, Schechter was simply too small a player to be relevant to interstate commerce.|$|R
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to. Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would {{help make the}} music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Rùm therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on Rùm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for Rùm, and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E

60|$|Louis <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> frame she {{was truly}} fit to cheer and sustain James. How she might endure the actual {{struggle}} with penury, he dared not imagine; at present {{he could only}} be carried along by her lofty composure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{a little}} {{about it at the}} time, by accident. I have always remembered it.... I have always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} like <b>this</b> would happen." ...|$|R
5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom Hourglass. In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link to be controlled. However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too disconnected from the game's action, thereby prompting them to switch the two screens. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a big chance {{for him to make}} a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite shuddered. She <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> from <b>this</b> man {{she could}} expect no mercy. All-powerful, {{he held the}} beloved life {{in the hollow of}} his hand. She knew him too well not to know that, if he failed in gaining his own ends, he would be pitiless.|$|R
5000|$|Novak Djokovic praised Murray {{after the}} match, conceding {{that he was}} the better player on the day, and stating <b>that</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Murray {{deserved}} <b>this</b> championship: ...|$|R
50|$|France {{planned to}} study {{mathematics}} at Ljubljana University, but altered his interest to electrical engineering after {{he visited the}} University’s electrical engineering laboratories. He never regretted <b>this</b> switch. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> field {{he would be able}} to combine his interest in mathematics with some hands-on work.|$|R
