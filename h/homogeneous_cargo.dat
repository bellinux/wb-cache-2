50|$|Dry {{cargo ships}} today are mainly bulk {{carriers}} and container ships. Bulk carriers or bulkers {{are used for}} the transportation of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>cargo</b> such as coal, rubber, copra, tin, and wheat. Container ships are used for the carriage of miscellaneous goods.|$|E
50|$|Truckload {{shipping}} is {{the movement}} of large amounts of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>cargo,</b> generally the amount necessary to fill an entire semi-trailer or intermodal container. A truckload carrier is a trucking company that generally contracts an entire trailer-load to a single customer. This is {{as opposed to a}} less-than truckload (LTL) company that generally mixes freight from several customers in each trailer. One advantage Full Truckload (FTL) carriers have over Less than Truckload carriers is that the freight is never handled en route, whereas an LTL shipment will typically be transported on several different trailers.|$|E

Dunnage bags are mostly used for <b>homogeneous</b> shaped <b>cargo</b> such as food & beverage products, electronics and appliances and roll paper. Often, strapping/lashing and dunnage bags are used in combination to secure chemical products. Dunnage Bags are not approved for rail transportation of hazardous materials in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pricing policy of transhipment route for India to move cargo through Bangladesh from Kolkata port to the capital city of Tripura i. e. Agartala. Initially, Bangladesh was hesitating to allow India to provide transhipment facility for the north eastern region but India reciprocate it in right direction by providing similar facility to Bangladesh to reach the Himalayan landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan, thereby, actively participate in moving towards an integrated transport network for this region as a whole. The future opening of Myanmar route further gives some relief to India. Most of the cargo originates from Kolkata (Port) and terminates at Guwahati and distributed to various destinations of north eastern states. We try to investigate the pricing policy of such transhipment route for India in terms of a Bertrand type model with non <b>homogeneous</b> type <b>cargo</b> movement where the unit price of cargo transhipment taken as a proxy for such transhipment route. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} multiple mono-energetic gamma lines produced from low threshold, high-Q nuclear reactions {{can be used}} to detect the presence of high-Z material shielded in low- and medium-Z cargo. Specifically, this work establishes a research foundation to inform the eventual development and optimization of a new type of low-dose, rapid-scan, transmission radiography imaging system designed to detect the presence of special nuclear material in cargo. This thesis explores the processes, reactions, and detection methods that may be used to develop a transmission imaging system significantly different from existing interrogation methods and major systems currently deployed in the field. This thesis introduces the nuclear smuggling issue, provides relevant background information, and defines the high-Z material detection problem. It also provides a brief overview of SNM detection efforts, to include both passive and active detection, and shows why active detection methods are needed to detect shielded SNM. The thesis then explains the underlying physics important to multiple monoenergetic gamma line imaging and defines key concepts to the characterization of cargo. An overview of the experimental concept and setup, to include development of a theoretical model to predict imaging counts, simulations conducted in support of the experiment, the presence and mitigation of neutrons in the beam line, major equipment and materials used, and the data acquisition and analysis software programs employed is then provided. This work considers and explains the difficulties of scanning of <b>homogeneous</b> and non-homogeneous <b>cargoes,</b> potential scanning system vulnerabilities to high-Z material smuggling, and suggests future efforts to address these vulnerabilities. The purpose, conduct, and results of 161 individual tests are provided. Finally, this thesis provides conclusions and recommendations for future work that could lead to development of a better cargo scanning system. Key achievements of this thesis included development of a simple attenuation model to predict the theoretical ratio of two monoenergetic gamma lines transmitted through complex cargo, exploration of the ability to discriminate between medium and high-Z materials both as pure cargo and when embedded in Fe, and the This research demonstrates that multiple mono-energetic gamma lines produced from low threshold, high-Q nuclear reactions {{can be used to}} detect the presence of high-Z material shielded in low- and medium-Z cargo.
