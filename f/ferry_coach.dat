5000|$|It is {{not likely}} that {{the founders of the}} United States {{considered}} the right to ownership of property as absolute. They understood that in a community, ownership of property, indeed the very value of property itself, rested to some extent on mutual obligations. “Ownership in land — the most tangible, and {{in the early days of}} the Republic, the most important form of property — had never meant absolute control over that property or an unfettered right to use it in any way the owner wanted. Traditions going back to English common law have always placed restrictions on property. The common law doctrine of nuisance, for example, prevented owners from using their land in a way that interfered unreasonably with the rights of their neighbors. Custom often allowed hunting on private, unenclosed land, or required that an owner allow access to rivers and lakes. Property in the form of businesses also had regulations on them; taverns, <b>ferries</b> and <b>coach</b> lines, for example, were often heavily regulated in both England and the North American colonies.” [...] While the founders regarded the right to own property as sacrosanct, they certainly did not regard that right as implying immunity from regulation.|$|R
5000|$|Hooghly (37 km) for {{passenger}} traffic on 15 August 1854. More than 3,000 applications were {{received from the}} people wanting a ride in the first train in eastern India. The first train ran to full capacity. The train left Howrah station at 8:30 a.m. and reached Hooghly in 91 minutes. It had three first-class and two second-class coaches. It also had three trucks for third-class passengers and a brakevan for the guard. All of these were built in India, because the ship <b>ferrying</b> the original <b>coaches</b> from England had unfortunately met with natural disaster in the high seas and consequently sunk. The locomotive however was imported, though not without its own difficulties. The ship bringing the locomotive had initially, due to a navigational error, had sailed to Australia, {{and had to be}} re-routed back to India.|$|R

50|$|The ferry fleet was {{substantially}} overhauled {{during the}} 1990s, adding several amenities—including buffet restaurants, bars, and lounges—intended {{to promote the}} ride as a draw in itself. The DRBA operates a shuttle service {{on both sides of}} the bay in the summer months, giving foot passengers both a ride on the ferry and round-trip transportation from the terminals into Cape May and Lewes for one combined rate. In Delaware, the shuttle operates two routes. The first shuttle route connects the ferry to downtown Lewes, with limited afternoon service to Cape Henlopen State Park. The second shuttle route operates to the park and ride lot in Lewes and offers connections to another shuttle to the Tanger Outlets and Rehoboth Beach. At the park and ride lot, the shuttle connects to DART First State's Beach Bus routes that serve the Delaware Beaches and provide connections to the Beach Bus in Ocean City, Maryland. In New Jersey, the shuttle connects the ferry to the Cape May Welcome Center in downtown Cape May. The DRBA also operates a shuttle bus that links the ferry to the Cape May County Park & Zoo on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays from late June to the end of August and to the Tree to Tree Aerial adventure park at the zoo Sundays through Thursdays from late May to late September. The Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts operates trolley tours of Cape May from the ferry terminal from late June to the end of August, with the Cape May Lighthouse tour operating on Mondays and the Emlen Physick Estate tour operating on Wednesdays.
