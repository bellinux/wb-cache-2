Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. They considered <b>high</b> <b>powered</b> and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E

Exercising proper selection of packaging component could improve the life time of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED. In this work, {{the significance of the}} heat slug geometry on the heat dissipation of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED was addressed through simulation analysis. The heat slug geometries were varied in order to compare the heat dissipation of the <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED. Ansys version 11 was utilized for the simulation. The heat dissipation of the <b>high</b> <b>power</b> LED was evaluated in terms of junction temperature, von Mises stress and thermal resistance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid PV-battery grid connected system suitable for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> PV <b>power</b> applications. <b>High</b> <b>power</b> PV systems have impressive voltage fluctuation {{with regards to}} their maximum power point voltage. Using DC/DC converters to regulate this voltage is inefficient in <b>high</b> <b>power</b> systems as it adds an extra power conversion stage. On the other hand switching frequency, voltage stress as inverter limitations and power quality issues {{should be considered in}} <b>high</b> <b>power</b> applications. Central PV structures because of low efficiency and high cost inverters are not suitable for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> systems. Maximum power extraction from PV together with active and reactive injected power control is another challenge in <b>high</b> <b>power</b> system. Z-source multilevel inverter for PV arrays together with battery energy storage systems is a suitable solution for <b>high</b> <b>power</b> application. This paper proposes a control strategy for this hybrid system. A simulation with PSCAD has been done to validate the control strategy. Simulation results show how proposed control and topology satisfies <b>high</b> <b>power</b> requirements for PV grid connected systems...|$|R

5|$|Hamilton's prowess as {{a runner}} and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans. Offensive {{coordinator}} Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football {{mixed in with}} complex timing routes. Hamilton racked up yardage, touchdowns, and wins for Tech. In 1998, Hamilton and Tech's <b>high</b> <b>powered</b> offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Hamilton's senior year {{put him on the}} national stage. He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne. Hamilton passed for over 3000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards. But while Hamilton dazzled, the Georgia Tech defense was a liability (they allowed around 28 points per game), and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy. In a late-season, nationally televised game against Wake Forest, Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. As an indirect result, Dayne {{went on to win the}} Heisman (Joe was runner-up). Hamilton's Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami, where the Jackets lost 28–13. The following season, redshirt junior George Godsey, a more traditional pocket passer, succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech's powerful offense. The drop-off was minimal—Godsey continued where Hamilton left off, winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001. In 2000, Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archival Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
