Any all events my contention is at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia, some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings I never saw it.|$|E
25|$|Australia had {{substantially}} {{the better}} of it, Walters adding his name to the fairly select list {{of those who have}} made a hundred in their first Test...After Walters's innings I wrote that with one necessary qualification <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48.

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|Liviu Librescu {{was born}} in 1930 to a Jewish family {{in the city of}} Ploiești, Romania. After Romania allied with Nazi Germany in World War II, his family was {{deported}} to a labor camp in Transnistria, and later, along with thousands of other Jews, was deported to a ghetto in the Romanian city of Focșani. His wife, Marlena, who is also a [...] Holocaust survivor, told Israeli Channel 10 TV the day after his death, [...] "We were in Romania during the Second World War, and we were Jews there among the Germans, and among the anti-Semitic Romanians." [...] Dorothea Weisbuch, a cousin of Librescu living in Romania, said in an interview to Romanian newspaper [...] Cotidianul: [...] "He was an extraordinarily gifted person and very altruistic. When he was little, he was very curious and knew everything, so that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become very conceited, but it did not happen so; he was of a rare modesty." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Roth was commissioned, {{alongside}} {{several other}} artists, {{to paint a}} portrait of the collector and dealer Carl Laszlo to celebrate his fortieth birthday. Roth took a solarized photo of the Swiss collector, and painted over it with processed cheese [...] "in order to get his goat. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> turn blue and green, like cheese." [...] This became the first of his celebrated biodegradable works. In a series of works called Insel ("Island", 1968), for instance, Roth would take a blue panel, cover it in foodstuffs arranged as islands on the background, cover the surface in yoghurt, then cover that in a layer of plaster, leaving the piece to undergo a series of transformations; mouldy stages, bacterial decay, insect attack, and then stability as only nondegradable elements were left.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Ljungberg {{made his}} Sweden U21 debut. Ljungberg almost {{did not make}} it as an {{international}} player because Sweden coach Lasse Lagerbäck thought Ljungberg was too short. In Fredrik Ljungberg: Up Close, Lagerbäck stated, [...] "Of course it's difficult to say at 15 to 16 years of age (whether or not a player {{has the potential to be}} an international player). To be honest, I wouldn't say <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become an international player because he was very very little. In his first match, we played Denmark and he scored twice so he convinced me rather fast that he was a good player even if he was very very small but he was quick." [...] On 10 November 1996, Ljungberg scored twice in a game against Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2009 {{article in}} the Toluca Lake, California, Tolucan Times, {{columnist}} Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple's meeting, Florence said, [...] "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so {{we were able to}} continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." [...] She also pointed out, [...] "You know, he's not funny all the time. He can be very serious." [...] At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years. Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.|$|E
2500|$|When the sprint race had finished, Palmer stated on the podium, [...] "Yesterday {{was first}} to sixth in one lap {{and now it is}} sixth to first so it {{definitely}} made up for it and I am absolutely delighted. We had done a lot of homework on the start and the tyre degradation and I think we nailed them both. He described the race as [...] "tough" [...] and drove more conseratively with the knowledge he acculated from the previous [...] day's race and also made set-up and balance changes. Trummer said it felt [...] "really good" [...] to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, [...] "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even {{at the end of the}} race <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> struggle more but he didn’t. It was really hard to attack him. That was a great race. I had a great pace and I’m happy with P2." [...] Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an [...] "unbelievable" [...] start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season. He said after the first corner, he was maintaining third place and praised Trummer for his performance in spite of not overtaking him in the first three laps.|$|E

6000|$|... "Arnie, you mustn't {{think of}} it," [...] she begged. [...] "He would never forgive me--never. The first time I {{asked him what}} was going on there, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have struck me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{was with}} us just now, {{and said he was}} so tired of {{lounging}} about, that he was resolved to go and dance; so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ask you, if he met with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hoped so, {{although}} there was no arrangement between us to meet here. Still, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have made his way down here, if possible, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> then be able to escape in the lugger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} no matter though he should live for ever. I {{have told him}} everything. I {{did not mean to}} do it because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be weak; but he has been strong enough for that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{have been}} to his house at Pos'ham, where he's staying with his sisters; walked there and back, and I wouldn't have missed it for fifty guineas. <b>I</b> hardly <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see me; but he did see me. And he hasn't forgot you.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, I rather did. Not that I should have dreamed of his {{corresponding}} with me had he spoken to me on a certain subject. But as, on that subject, he never {{opened his mouth to}} me, <b>I</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> write." ...|$|R
