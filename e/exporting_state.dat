Using a differentiated products world wheat model, the impacts of Canadian price discrimination on the welfare of competing exporters are considered. The results show that competing exporters could be better or worse off as result of price discrimination, but the impacts were small. Over a range of possible elasticities US producers were generally better off if North American arbitrage is assumed. Other wheat exporting regions could see their producer’s welfare change between 2 and - 0. 5 %. Given these small impacts, the study suggests that explicit disciplines on discriminatory pricing exporting STEs may not be appropriate.

This makes it more difficult, given the global structure of investment law that consists of networks of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). This article will not deal {{with the question of}} optimal structure of regulatory discretion under BITs which is still debatable among scholars. The central agenda {{of this article is to}} address the precondition for an efficient outcome to materialize within the complex web of BITs already signed among states.

40|$|Council {{reached a}} {{decision}} on frameworks {{to continue with the}} multilateral trade negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). These agreements lay the foundations for future reform of global agricultural trade. On non-agricultural market access (NAMA), the framework sets the stage for the pursuit of tariff cuts and the reduction or elimination of non-tariff barriers. WTO members have also agreed to intensify efforts toward services liberalization and to incorporate trade facilitation in the DDA. These agreements help put the Doha round back on track after the “detour ” of the WTO Ministerial in Cancun. Arguably the most significant piece of the “July Package” concerns agricultural trade. 1 The agreed framework lays out a map for the future elimination of all forms of export subsidies and for better disciplines on export credits, <b>exporting</b> <b>state</b> trading enterprises and food aid. It also introduces new commitments to discipline trade-distorting farm subsidies, promoting deeper cuts in countries with higher subsidies. Moreover, it commits WTO members to pursue “progressivity ” in tariff reductions with a view to achieve substantial improvements in market access while allowing for flexibility in the treatment of sensitive products. This outcome is most welcome, not only in view of the checkered history of multilateral disciplines for agricultural trade, but also in terms of its potential to help the DDA deliver on its promise of being a development-oriented round. As discussed below, this is just a first step (albeit an important one) in a long march and the complexities to achieve a final agreement should not be underestimated. Still, the agricultural negotiations have already {{played an important role in}} underscoring the emerging new geography of international trade in which developing countries have a growing weight and political voice in multilateral fora...|$|E
40|$|The {{community}} of tomato growers in Australia, which is largely {{based in the}} Goulburn Valley in Victoria, has been so affected by economic decline that their ‘viability was under threat’ (Australian Productivity Commission [PC], 2013). How and whether this situation can be improved {{is a challenge to}} government — federal, state and local — the wholesale and retail fruit markets, growers and producers. In the course of finding a solution to this decline, the media — both commercial and social — {{played a significant role in}} developing public opinion and in seeing its effect in action. The improvement of parlous social and economic conditions in farming communities where tomato growing is a major industry is complicated by the scope of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s international trade obligations — multilateral, regional, and bilateral. The range of legally compliant remedies is limited to restraints on imports by the alteration of tariffs or the imposition of quotas, including zero quotas (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], 1994, Article XIX; Agreement on Safeguards [AoS], 1994). But the availability of these depends on serious damage being caused by a sudden and unforeseen increase in the level of imports of processed tomatoes or their sale in Australia at a price below the cost of their production. There are further limitations if the source of the imports is at a low level and from a developing country or where any action is foreclosed by the terms of an existing Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) with the <b>exporting</b> <b>state.</b> It is important to remember that these goods are being lawfully traded and to interfere with the terms of trade goes against the policy of trade liberalisation, which Australia has enthusiastically upheld for a long period of time...|$|E

Drawing on Vietnam {{as a case study}} and the private Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) criteria {{as an example of a}} broader sustainability scheme, in the analysis we identify concerns of a human rights or labour rights character that risk becoming institutionalised in an adverse fashion as a result of the FLEGT’s scheme’s legality orientation with regard to <b>exporting</b> <b>states</b> as well as importers who place timber on the EUmarket, and the assumption that civil society involvement in <b>exporting</b> <b>states</b> will sufficiently ensure consideration of such concerns. Next we consider potential adverse impact on the usage of broader sustainability schemes, such as FSC, which address social sustainability as well as the environment but do not (yet) deliver legality verification required by the EU Timber Regulation from March 2013. We also discuss possible contributions that could follow from adding a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perspective to the FLEGT approach, given increasing recognition that CSR may be promoted by public regulation. We conclude that although the FLEGT scheme seeks to achieve commendable objectives, it could do more to address human rights related to forestry usage, harvest and timber processing through the combined force of law and the market on which the scheme builds...|$|R
