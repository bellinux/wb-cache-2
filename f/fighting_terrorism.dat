5|$|The {{script for}} the episode went through 30 drafts, and four {{separate}} stories before the BBC were satisfied {{and ordered the}} series. Writing the pilot was completed before the September 11 terrorist attacks; after the attacks took place, the producers decided to add mention of the events into the episode in order to acknowledge {{the fact that the}} series is about <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kudos Film and Television {{developed}} Spooks after releasing Channel 4 medical drama Psychos in 1999, {{though the}} company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a post-Cold War spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.|$|E

25|$|In October 2008, Japan {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with India under which it would grant the latter a low-interest loan worth US$4.5 billion to construct a high-speed rail line between Delhi and Mumbai. This is the single largest overseas project being financed by Japan and reflects growing economic partnership between the two. India and Japan signed a security co-operation agreement in which both will hold military exercises, police the Indian Ocean and conduct military-to-military exchanges on <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism,</b> making India one of only three countries, the other two being the United States and Australia, with which Japan has such a security pact. There are 25,000 Indians in Japan as of 2008.|$|E
25|$|McCain {{argues that}} American {{military}} and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US {{in the name}} of <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism.</b> He fears the administration's policy will put American prisoners at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at Geneva Conventions. He argues that his rival bill to Bush’s plan gives defendants access to classified evidence being used to convict them and will set tight limits on use of testimony obtained by coercion. Furthermore it offers CIA interrogators some legal protections from charges of abuse, but rejects the administration’s plan to more narrowly define the Geneva Conventions’ standards for humane treatment of prisoners. McCain insists this issue overrides politics.|$|E

25|$|During a 2015 {{visit to}} King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Gabriel {{launched}} an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer Raif Badawi and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice {{in a region}} in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past. He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip. His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism</b> and Islamic State militants, particularly given Germany’s status as Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports. While the U.S. State Department had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did {{not talk about the}} case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the 2005 London bombings, a new {{directive}} stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit Auxiliary program {{with the intent of}} reducing crime and <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism</b> in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit portable radios. Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrences, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the transit location. The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system.|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{originally}} underwent 30 rewrites {{and four}} separate story ideas before the BBC {{was satisfied with}} it. Similarly, the second episode went through four rewrites. After four episodes were written, the September 11 attacks took place, resulting in three thousand deaths in the United States. As a result, the episodes were rewritten {{to take account of}} the events to assure the audience that the show is about <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism.</b> According to Wolstencroft, the attacks [...] "sidewinded" [...] the show, [...] "perversely made it as relevant as can be," [...] and [...] "commuted a great sense of responsibility" [...] on Spooks.|$|E

500|$|The White House {{released}} a statement in which it said that senior American officials had expressed their condolences to Pakistan and that the officials expressed [...] "our desire {{to work together to}} determine what took place, and our commitment to the U.S.-Pakistan partnership which advances our shared interests, including <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism</b> in the region". US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke to their Pakistani counterparts to give their [...] "deepest condolences" [...] in a joint statement and also supported a NATO investigation. The commander of the International Security Assistance Force is [...] "personally paying the highest attention" [...] to the matter. The Obama administration pledged co-operation with Pakistan and ordered a full investigation and inquiry to be conducted into the attack. A few days later after the incident, President Barack Obama personally phoned President Asif Ali Zardari to express his sorrow over the deaths of the soldiers and, according to a press release, [...] "made it clear that this regrettable incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan and reiterated the United States' strong commitment to a full investigation." [...] while stopping short of offering a formal apology.|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, {{to do what they want}} him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in the point of view of the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism,</b> though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E

2500|$|In {{arguing against}} the term Global War on Terror, Francis Fukuyama said the United States was not <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism</b> generically, as in Chechnya or Palestine.

[...] He suggested it might be deeper than the ideological conflict of the Cold War, but {{it should not be}} confused with Samuel Huntington's [...] "clash of civilizations." [...] Addressing Huntington's thesis, Fukuyama stressed that the US and its allies need to focus on specific radical groups rather than clash with global Islam.|$|E

2500|$|Netanyahu's {{victory over}} the pre-election {{favorite}} Shimon Peres surprised many. The main catalyst in {{the downfall of the}} latter was a wave of suicide bombings shortly before the elections; on 3 and 4 March 1996, Palestinians carried out two suicide bombings, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. Unlike Peres, Netanyahu did not trust Yasser Arafat and conditioned any progress at the peace process on the Palestinian National Authority fulfilling its obligations – mainly <b>fighting</b> <b>terrorism,</b> and ran with the campaign slogan [...] "Netanyahu – making a safe peace". However, although Netanyahu won the election for Prime Minister, Labor won the Knesset elections, beating the Likud–Gesher–Tzomet alliance, meaning Netanyahu had to rely on a coalition with the ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and UTJ (whose social welfare policies flew in the face of his capitalistic outlook) in order to govern.|$|E
