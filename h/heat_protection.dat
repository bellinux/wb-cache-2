25|$|The {{associated}} problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, {{there would}} be increased pressure on the remaining two, and {{if one of them}} popped out the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to Galileo revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun any closer than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had to be protected from that extra heat, part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one device drivers had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the <b>heat</b> <b>protection.</b> They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cross {{tolerance}} is {{a phenomenon}} that occurs when a plant, in resisting one form of stress, develops a tolerance to another form. Pretreatment with nonlethal heat shock {{has been known to}} protect cells from metal stress. In this study, we found that the treatment of rice roots with more than 25 μM of Cu 2 + caused cell death. However, heat shock pretreatment attenuated Cu 2 +-induced cell death. The mechanisms of the cross tolerance phenomenon between heat shock and Cu 2 + stress were investigated by pretreated rice roots with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CHX eVectively block <b>heat</b> shock <b>protection,</b> suggesting that protection of Cu 2 +-induced cell death by heat shock was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. In addition, heat pretreatment downregulated ROS production and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities, both of which can be greatly elicited by Cu 2 + stress in rice roots. Moreover, the addition of puriWed recombinant GST–OsHSP 70 fusion proteins inhibited Cu 2 +-enhanced MAPK activities in an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, loss of <b>heat</b> shock <b>protection</b> was observed in Arabidopsis mkk 2 and mpk 6 but not in mpk 3 mutants under Cu 2 + stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of OsHSP 70 with MAPKs may contribute to the cellular protection in rice roots from excessive Cu 2 + toxicity...|$|R

40|$|Germinating conidiospores of Neurospora crassa {{that were}} exposed to 45 degrees C, a {{temperature}} that induces a heat shock response, were protected from injury caused by freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing at 0 degrees C. Whereas up to 90 % of the control spores were killed by this freezing and slow thawing, a prior heat shock increased cell survival four- to fivefold. Survival was determined by three assays: the extent of spore germination in liquid medium, the number of colonies that grew on solid medium, and dry-weight accumulation during exponential growth in liquid culture. The <b>heat</b> shock-induced <b>protection</b> against freezing injury was transient. Spores transferred to normal growth temperature after exposure to heat shock and before freezing lost the <b>heat</b> shock-induced <b>protection</b> within 30 min. Spores subjected to freezing and thawing stress synthesized small amounts of the heat shock proteins that are synthesized in large quantities by cells exposed to 45 degrees C. Pulse-labeling studies demonstrated that neither chilling the spores to 10 degrees C or 0 degrees C {{in the absence of}} freezing nor warming the spores from 0 degrees C to 30 degrees C induced heat shock protein synthesis. The presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide during spore exposure to 45 degrees C did not abolish the protection against freezing injury induced by heat shock.
