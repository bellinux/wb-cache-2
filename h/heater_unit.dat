50|$|The Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) is a {{generator}} {{based on a}} Stirling engine powered by a large radioisotope <b>heater</b> <b>unit.</b> The hot end of the Stirling converter reaches high temperature and heated helium drives the piston, heat being rejected at the cold end of the engine. A generator or alternator converts the motion into electricity. Given the very constrained supply of plutonium, the Stirling converter is notable for producing about {{four times as much}} electric power from the plutonium fuel as compared to a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). The Stirling generators were extensively tested on Earth by NASA, but their development was cancelled in 2013 before they could be deployed on actual spacecraft missions.|$|E
50|$|Lunokhod 1 was a {{lunar vehicle}} formed of a tub-like {{compartment}} {{with a large}} convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Its length was 2.3 m. Lunokhod was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to test the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical properties. An X-ray spectrometer, an X-ray telescope, cosmic ray detectors, and a laser device were also included. The vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the lunar day by a solar cell array mounted {{on the underside of}} the lid. To be able to work in vacuum a special fluoride based lubricant was used for the mechanical parts and the electric motors (one in each wheel hub) were enclosed in pressurized containers. During the lunar nights, the lid was closed and a polonium-210 radioisotope <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> kept the internal components at operating temperature. Lunokhod 1 was intended to operate through three lunar days (approximately three Earth months) but actually operated for eleven lunar days.|$|E

50|$|The rover stood 135 cm (4 ft 5 in) {{high and}} had a mass of 840 kg (1,850 lb). It was about 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) long and 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) wide and had eight wheels each with an {{independent}} suspension, electric motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, ~1 km/h and ~2 km/h (0.6 mph and 1.2 mph). Lunokhod 2 was equipped with three television cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different frame rates—3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame. These images were used by a five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. Power was supplied by a solar panel {{on the inside of}} a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioisotope <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights. There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover. Scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels, a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover {{on the end of a}} 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) boom, a radiometer, a photodetector (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser corner reflector.

40|$|A hollow cathode-based plasma {{contactor}} {{has been}} selected for use on the Space Station. During {{the operation of the}} plasma contactor, the hollow cathode heater will endure approximately 12000 thermal cycles. Since a hollow cathode heater failure would result in a plasma contactor failure, a hollow cathode heater development program was established to produce a reliable heater. The development program includes the heater design, process documents for both heater fabrication and assembly, and heater testing. The heater design was a modification of a sheathed ion thruster cathode heater. Heater tests included testing of the <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> alone and plasma contactor and ion thruster testing. To date, eight heaters have been or are being processed through <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> testing, two through plasma contactor testing and three through ion thruster testing, all using direct current power supplies. Comparisons of data from <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> performance tests before cyclic testing, plasma contactor tests, and ion thruster tests at the ignition input current level show the average deviation of input power and tube temperature near the cathode tip to be +/- 0. 9 W and +/- 21 C, respectively. <b>Heater</b> <b>unit</b> testing included cyclic testing to evaluate reliability under thermal cycling. The first heater, although damaged during assembly, completed 5985 ignition cycles before failing. Four additional heaters successfully completed 6300, 6300, 700, and 700 cycles. <b>Heater</b> <b>unit</b> testing is currently ongoing for three heaters which have to date accumulated greater than 7250, greater than 5500, and greater than 5500 cycles, respectively...|$|E
