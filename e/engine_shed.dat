5|$|The GCR {{constructed}} an <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> at {{the site}} in 1897, but it was short lived. A locomotive servicing area, consisting of a turntable and coaling stage remained in use {{until the end of}} steam traction at the station in 1966.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 an <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> {{had been}} {{opened on the}} south bank of the River Avon {{on the east side}} of the line to the B station. Between 1859 and 1875, 23 engines were built in the {{workshops}} attached to the shed, including several distinctive Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives.|$|E

5|$|The Danish Railway Museum is the {{national}} railway museum of Denmark, the largest such museum in Scandinavia. It was established in 1975 in a former <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> adjacent to the city's main railway station and has an area of over , with some 50 locomotives and railway carriages on 20 rail tracks from all periods of Danish rail history. The oldest steam engine dates back to 1869.|$|E

5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated {{the closure of the}} line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> was closed in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Avonmouth {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a self-contained railway which {{ran along the}} River Avon in Bristol, England. The station, which opened in 1865, was adjacent to a pier on the River Severn at Avonmouth. It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> and water tank. The station was closed in 1902 as the land was required for the expansion of Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903. The hotel continued in operation until 1926, when it too was demolished {{to make way for the}} docks. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} situated at a passing loop, {{with a single}} platform {{on the north side}} of the line. The building, which is noted as having been architecturally superior to other stations on the line, contained a booking office, porters' rooms, and an office for the line superintendent. The platform was covered along its entire length. A single-road <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> was sited at the east end of the station from 1875, but burnt down in 1900. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction, however trains did not stop at Shirehampton on Sundays due to opposition from a local church, but this practice ended in May the same year following complaints from other residents and businesses.|$|E

5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E
25|$|After closure, {{the station}} was {{demolished}} and the turntable taken out and built on. The site today is Melton Constable industrial estate. The old works buildings (the longshops, erecting shop and <b>engine</b> <b>shed)</b> are used for potato storage. The yard near the water tower is used for storage. To {{the south of the}} buildings, the site of the South Junction is now industrial buildings. The gasworks have been demolished. The 1951 <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> survives in use. The goods shed, although not connected to the works, survives. Many of the buildings have been re-roofed with modern roofs of metal and not tiles. Also, the chimneys have been demolished, one next to the <b>engine</b> <b>shed</b> as recently as the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|The Great Eastern {{had one of}} {{the largest}} <b>engine</b> <b>sheds</b> in the country at Stratford which in January 1923 had an {{allocation}} of 555 locomotives. At {{the other end of the}} scale, small <b>engine</b> <b>sheds</b> at the end of country branch lines had perhaps one or two locomotives in their charge. At this time the locomotives were generally allocated to the major shed in the area and the smaller sheds had no actual allocation.|$|R
