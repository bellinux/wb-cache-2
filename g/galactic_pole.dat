Out of the stars observed, a list of faint blue stars was constructed by Milton L. Humason and Fritz Zwicky in 1947, with their blue hue suggesting a relatively high effective temperature. The 29th star on their list, HZ 29, was found to have the most peculiar spectrum out of the set. It displayed an absence of hydrogen lines, but broad, diffuse lines of neutral (non-ionized) helium. This was interpreted as a hydrogen-deficient white dwarf. In 1962, this star was observed with a photoelectric detector and was found to vary in magnitude over a period of 18 minutes. The light curve of the variation displayed a double sinusoid pattern. Later, a flickering behavior was observed, which suggested a mass transfer.|$|E

40|$|We make a {{detailed}} analysis of the indirect diffuse gamma-ray signals from dark matter annihilation in the Galaxy. We include the prompt emission, as well as the emission from inverse Compton scattering whenever the annihilation products contain light leptons. We consider both the contribution from the smooth dark matter halo and that from substructures. The main parameters for the latter are the mass function index and the minimal subhalo mass. We use recent results from N-body simulations to set the most reasonable range of parameters, and find that the signal can be boosted by a factor ranging from 2 to 15 towards the <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> slightly more towards the Galactic anticenter, with an important dependence on the subhalo mass index. This uncertainty is however much less than that of the extragalactic signal studied in the literature. We derive upper bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section using the isotropic gamma-ray emission measured by Fermi-LAT, for two directions in the sky, the Galactic anticenter and the <b>Galactic</b> <b>pole(s).</b> The former represents the lowest irreducible signal from dark matter annihilation, and the latter is robust as the astrophysical background, dominated by the hadronic contribution, is rather well established in that direction. Finally, we show how the knowledge of the minimal subhalo mass, which formally depends on the dark matter particle interactions with normal matter, can be used to derive the mass function index.

40|$|We {{study the}} Faraday {{rotation}} measure (RM) {{due to the}} Galactic magnetic field (GMF) toward high Galactic latitudes. The RM arises from the global, regular component {{as well as from}} the turbulent, random component of the GMF. We model the former based on observations and the latter using the data of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. For a large number of different GMF models, we produce mock RM maps around the <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles</b> and calculate various statistical quantities with the RM maps. We find that the observed medians of RMs toward the north and south <b>Galactic</b> <b>poles,</b> ∼ 0. 0 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2 and ∼ + 6. 3 ± 0. 5 rad m^- 2, are difficult to explain with any of our many alternate GMF models. The standard deviation of observed RMs, ∼ 9 rad m^- 2, is clearly larger than that of simulated RMs. The second-order structure function of observed RMs is substantially larger than that of simulated RMs, especially at small angular scales. We discuss other possible contributions to RM toward high Galactic latitudes. Besides observational errors and the intrinsic RM of background radio sources against which RM is observed, we suggest that the RM due to the intergalactic magnetic field may account for a substantial fraction of the observed RM. Finally we note that reproducing the observed medians may require additional components or/and structures of the GMF that are not present in our models. Comment: To appear in ApJ.
