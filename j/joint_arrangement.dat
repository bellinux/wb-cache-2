Not only do parents in <b>joint</b> custody <b>arrangements</b> report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody <b>arrangements,</b> but <b>joint</b> custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a childâ€™s well-being following divorce.
