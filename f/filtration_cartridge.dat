Direct involvement of filter manufacturers to determine actual filter cut-offs during environmental applications would be highly beneficial to increase the comparability of the measurements of filterable element concentrations.

40|$|Background: Circulating {{tumor cells}} (CTCs) are {{released}} in {{blood from the}} primary tumor, but although very heterogeneous both in size and marker expression, are very rare and provide information not available from the primary tumor. The identification of CTC cells and clusters could advance our understanding of metastasis and help personalize therapy. 1, 2 Notably, CTC clusters were shown {{to have a higher}} metastatic potential than single cells 3 but the process remains poorly understood. We present a multistage filtration system with pore sizes from 20 down to 8 3 ̆bcm for the size-selective enrichment of Ov 90 ovarian cancer cells and clusters from blood. Each captured cell population was released, cultured and characterized independently. Methods: We developed a 3 D printed multistage <b>filtration</b> <b>cartridge</b> and polymer filters with 20, 15, 12, 10 and 8 3 ̆bcm-diameter pores. Filters were stacked from 20 (top) to 8 3 ̆bcm (bottom) and used to enrich and sort Ov- 90 cells spiked in 1 : 6 mL of blood:PBS. Captured cells were released by removing individual filters from the cartridge, reverse flowing OSE medium, and then cultured separately. Results: Ov- 90 clusters were found mostly on the top filter (20 3 ̆bcm) and interestingly, few small clusters (3 - 4 cells) were found on the 8 and 10 3 ̆bcm filters, suggesting alignment of cluster cells as they pass through the pores. 2 ̆ 074 Cell and nucleus diameters were measured, and a general correlation was found between filter pore size and cell and nucleus size. Interestingly, nucleus size was found to be the single most significant parameter in determining passage of single cells and small clusters through pores. Following cell culture, two distinct phenotypes were observed: cell captured on small pore filters (8 - 12 3 ̆bcm) grew primarily in a monolayer. Cells captured on filters with larger pores (15 - 20 3 ̆bcm) first grew as monolayer, but rapidly formed cell aggregates that subsequently detached from the surface. Staining for E-Cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion protein, revealed a loss of expression of cells from filter with larger pores. Conclusion: We developed a new multistage filtration method and selectively enriched and sorted cells based primarily on their nucleus size. We identified two Ov- 90 populations with different growth behaviors with low E-cadherin expression on the cells forming clusters, which is known to correlate with metastasis. The application of multistage filters may also reveal different CTC populations based on nucleus and cell size. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Background. A water {{filtered}} by jug filter system (JFS) can {{be applied}} for the preparation of food products, {{as well as it}} can be directly consumed as drinking water. In the European Union, in both above-mentioned cases the quality of water filtered using JFSs has to fulfill the requirements listed in Directive 98 / 83 /EC. However, Directive 98 / 83 /EC sets no parametric value for silver, JFSs are not regulated under this legislative act and additionally, silver-modified activated carbon (applied in such systems) has not been approved by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Therefore, the exposure to this metal should be assessed for all JFSs containing <b>filtration</b> <b>cartridges</b> with silver-modified activated carbon, present on the retail market. Objective. A comprehensive study was conducted in order to examine the effect of JFSs (consisted of filtration oval-cartridges of the new type with silver-modified activated carbon) on the quality of filtered water regarding the released amounts of silver. Silver migration from such type of cartridges has not been examined before. The aim of work was the assessment of exposure to silver released into filtered water from silver-modified activated carbon applied in such types of JFSs. Material and methods. Silver migration from six brands of JFSs (A–F) was investigated according to British Standard BS 8427 : 2004 using a validated inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method. Results.

More work related microbial detection and removal is needed. In this research, new methods using lanthanum-based chemical flocculation for concentration of bacteria and virus in water was successfully developed. The results showed that compared to traditional flocculants, LaCl 3 had the highest recovery efficiencies for bacteria and viruses detection based on microrespirometric assay, real-time PCR enumeration and infectivity assay. Compared to direct <b>cartridge</b> <b>filtration</b> using Nanoceram® and 1 MDS, the lanthanum-based chemical concentration method coupled with modified membrane filtration procedures has advantages in eliminating the use of expensive cartridge filters with improved virus detection efficiency. A mixture of bacteriophages isolated from municipal wastewater was used to control and remove biofilms. The results showed that P. aeruginosa phages effectively controlled and removed the bacterial biofilms. A combined use of phages and chlorine inhibited P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and removed pre-existing biofilms to a greater extent. Phages were also used to remove P. aeruginosa selectively in water filtration systems. The results indicate that for clean GAC filter, phage treatment not only effectively removes P. aeruginosa cells on the surface of filter media but also those located in the interior. The addition of phage did not affect the nitrification in the anthracite filtration system while the conversion of nitrite was affected to some extent in the GAC filter...|$|R

In this dissertation, the intra-event and inter-eventpartitioning, speciation, transport and transformation of N and P were examinedacross 40 runoff events and 13 retention periods on a paved urban source area. Aradial <b>cartridge</b> <b>filtration</b> (RCF) {{system and a}} volumetric clarifying filtration (VCF) system were tested {{for the performance of}} nutrient reduction. Results found that PM deposited in the watershed is the main contributor of nutrientsin runoff.   TN in dry deposition is stronglycorrelated with the organic content of PM. Results found that dissolved N (DN) is the predominant fraction, while settleable N (25 ~ 75 µm) held the lowest portion. Finer particles are preferred to be transported by runoff because it requires less streampower.  Mass-limited (first-order) modelis the predominant transport model for N fractions. Finer PM fractions are moreabundant in runoff, while coarser PM fractions show more significantfirst-flush effect.  Among DN species, NOx-and ON are the two predominant species. Mass transport behavior of DN species depends on the volume and duration of rainfall-runoff events. DP follows a mass-limitedmodel for each event due to the limited sources of phosphorus. The VCF system can effectively reduce TN and TPconcentrations by removing PM-associated nutrients. Higher removal efficiency was observed for coarser PM fraction. The RCF system showed 70 % removal efficiency on P while the N removal efficiency is not significant.   N is the controlling nutrient in runoff, therefore, reducing N loadings could effectively reduce the potential of eutrophication. During retentionperiods, an aerobic/anoxic zone is quickly created inside the RCF system. Thevariation of Water chemistry indices is related to the microbial respirations and decomposition of biogenic materials. DN increased over the retention time, indicating the decomposition of biogenic materials is the prevalent process. TAN and DON increased while NOx- decreased over time,where multiple pathways could be involved.  Pourbaix diagram indicates that the dominant Nspecies in rainfall, runoff and effluent is N 2 via biologica ldenitrification, while NH 4 + is predominant in retained stormwater. Result found the aerobic/anoxic cycle could promote N removal as the microorganisms has grown and evolved over the extended retention periods...|$|R
40|$|Clean {{drinking}} water is often {{taken for granted}} in first world countries, such as the United States. However, thousands of colonias residents (settlements in the Southwest US that lack access to basic infrastructure) still lack access to clean {{drinking water}}. Such {{is the case in}} the Paso Del Norte Region. In Doña Ana County, NM, and El Paso County, TX, colonia residents typically rely on shallow domestic wells and hauled water, respectively. However, both water sources can pose health concerns from elevated total dissolved solids and microbiological contamination. With connection to centralized water treatment and distribution still years away, colonias require a more immediate and effective solution for their current situation. This research proposed that such a solution could be achieved with a point-of-use (POU) water treatment system. The goal of this project was to provide colonia residents with an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable water treatment system. The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess user preferences and actual water quality data in order to design a household-level water treatment system; (2) develop a holistic point-of-use technology evaluation system that can be used by residents to screen and select a POU drinking water system for their home; and (3) evaluate methods for preserving water quality in drinking water storage tanks. First, focus group studies were conducted in colonias to discuss possible water treatment options and record residents’ perceptions and preferences. Water samples were collected from willing participants and analyzed for basic drinking water quality parameters. Second, many types of commercially available water treatment technologies were reviewed and analyzed, and a five-component evaluation and ranking system was developed to facilitate selection and implementation in colonias. Third, experiments were performed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of using copper and/or hypochlorite treatment to control algae and preserve water quality in storage tanks. The research performed in this study showed that colonias that rely on groundwater face more challenges, in the form of microbiological contamination and high salinity, than colonias that rely on hauled water. A treatment train of basic <b>cartridge</b> <b>filtration</b> and point-of-use desalination was proposed to address the water quality issues in colonias relying on well water or hauled water. It was also determined that the most economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable system was an under-the-sink reverse osmosis (RO) unit. This research also yielded a system of preserving water quality in drinking water tanks, which includes chlorine monitoring and dosing, periodic tank cleaning, and the possible use of copper as an algaecide. ...|$|R

Industrry is {{the biggest}} {{potential}} that creates the environmental pollution. Textile industry is categorized in varied industry branches with high water consuming and high waste water producing. During the industrial production and after different kinds of wastes come into being which causes environmental pollution. Production diversity in textile industry affects the waste water categorization. Textile industry includes different varieties of production proceseses causes waste water characteristics become so different and shows different consantrations in unit waste water amount. The water which is used at the poduction proses in the textile industry must be in a definite quality. The properties of the water used in textile fabrics directly {{affect the quality of}} the produced materials. It shows negative effect directly on the product quality if the water quality is not as it is needed. For this reason the quality of water is very important for preparing the ideal product. The waste water of textile industry is rather more coloured than the other industry branches because of the painting materials. The conventional treatment methods are unable to textile industry wastewater process due to the biologically resistant to decomposition of dyes and dye auxiliary chemical substances for thire complex structure. At the present, As the hold method(such as biological treatment, coagulation, adsorption), can not provide sufficient treatment, new technologies are needed for reusing and recovering of the waste water to reducing the consuming of water soure. For the recovery of textile wastewaters, membrane processes can meet this need with its High performance. Pre-treatment of High-performance membrane system shows highly additiion in a successful application. Selection of pre-treatment determines the performance of the entire plant. In a time serious blockage occurs {{on the surface of the}} membrane becuse of the materials which are not get through the membrane filtration. Because of the blockage reduction will be occurs in the flow and the performanes of membrane will be decrease. To prevent from this, pretreatment has done before the power flux is given to membrane. Pre refinement degree is set by the characteristic of power flux and membrane process structure which is used. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filtration</b> can be used for to hold the particules which are 5 - 10 &# 956;. The aims of the pre pretreatment are: - To prolonged the work time of the membrane - To prevent the blockage of membrane. - To increase the performance of the system. - To reduce the maintenance and repair cost of the system. In this study, applying pre- treatment methods before the membrane systems and the different membrane filtration systems in the subject of the treatment and recovery of the waste waters that belongs to different processes’, it is tried to be set up the highest filtration productivity that supplies in the membrane sorts and most proper pre-treatment method. At the same time the effect of the removal efficiency is researched by considerating the alternative of the pre-treatment. In this Laboratory-scale study, At first, characterization studies were carried out. The wastewater samples were taken from outputs of process of maximum water consumption and maximum wastewater production of Zorlu Linen Dokuma Emprime Konfeksiyon San. ve Tic. A. Ş. and color, conductivity, and COD analyzes were carried out. And then, Experimental studies to be carried out separately on the wastewater resulting from the washing process of woven finishing and bleaching proses of knit fabric finishing at the plant, In the Studies, different pre-treatment alternatives were determined for using wastewater and then the pre-treatment alternative which providing optimum conditions was selected for the final treatment of wastewater with membrane processes. In the characterization work, COD, conductivity and color parameters were measured for the sample. In the treatability studies for the selection of the membrane the all monitored parameters in the raw water and treated water are: flux, temperature, pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and color. In this experimental study mikrofiltration(MF- 0, 05 µm, MF- 0, 2 µm), ultrafiltration(UF) (UC 010 T), ozonation, UV-TiO 2, modified and unmodified zeolite sistem, ultrasound(UF) (UC 010 T), are used for the pre-treatment. For the last treatment, nanofiltration (NF) (270) and revers osmose(RO) (XLE) membrane systems are used. At the result of pre-treatmen process, all the compares has been done which are supplied from the analysis of the water quality parameters. From the achievable alternatives of the pre-treatmen, the most available pre-treatmen combination is choosed and the filtrate current is subjected to the last treatment process by the helping of membrane process. Experiments are done as pre-treatment and unpre-treatment style. In the pre-treatment tests the raw water directly feed to the membrane filtration for final treatment, In the pre-treatment experiments before the pre-treatment was operated and the obtained filtrate was subjected to membrane filtration for final treatment, and the results are given as a comparison. As a result, the different combinations of each which was tried for applicable pre-treatment alternatives of each shows different consequences. Also each pre-treatment alternative’s that supplies excellence elimination water quality parameter shows difference. For this reason in the choise of the pre-treatment which will realize prufying process must be known very well and in this way proper pre-treatment alternative must be chosen taking care to remove wanted pollutant parameter. To value the experimental studies, membrane types which for the parameter of the flow achieved high flux values, for water quality parameters achieved highest removal efficiencies were selected. The flux values that continuously monitored was before decreased and then was going to be constant. High-flux values obtained with NF 270 nanofiltration membrane, and high removal efficiencies were obtained with reverse osmosis XLE membrane. In the bleaching wastewater treatment, removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The highest curent value is recorded as 42 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the 0, 05 µm microfiltration. The lowest current value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the ultrasound experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higeset current value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of UV/TiO 2. At the recovery of bleaching proses effluents, in terms of removal efficiency effective results yielded from zeolite pre-treatment, to obtain a high flux, effective results yielded from UF pre-treatment. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. Bleaching wastewater was passed through NF 270 nanofiltration membrane after pre-treatment and results showes that according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency increased nearly to 42 %, for XLE reverse osmosis membrane, according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency has an increase of 50 %. In the washing proses removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The flux value of nanofiltration is higher than XLE. The highest curent value is recorded as 43 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the ultrafiltration. The lowest flux value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the zeolite experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higheset flux value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of 0. 2 µm microfiltration pre-treatment process. At the recovery of washing wastewater, in terms of removal efficiency and to achieve high flux, MF and UF pre-treatment sistems gave effective results. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. In this study which using membrane technologies and a variety of pre-treatment alternatives, color parameter that an important parameter for textile industries wastewater and up to now has not a standard in our country on this parameter was largely removed. In this Project, The all experiment results showes that reusable quality can be reached in textile industry wastewater by using the membrane technology. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
