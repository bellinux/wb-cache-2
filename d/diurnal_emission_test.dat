30|$|Phalaenopsis bellina, or P. violacea, emits monoterpenes during daytime and is {{considered}} as day-pollinated flowers. Here, we present that this <b>diurnal</b> <b>emission</b> is affected mainly by circadian clock {{and to a lesser}} degree by the light factor. This is different from other plant species, whose diurnal rhythm is usually regulated by a single factor. Rosa hybrida L. cv. Honesty, Antirrhinum majus, and Rosa damascena semperflorens emit monoterpenes regulated by a circadian clock regardless of the light stimulus (Helsper et al. 1998; Dudareva et al. 2003; Picone et al. 2004). In contrast, in Mahonia japonica and Rosa hybrida cv. Fragrant Cloud, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>emission</b> of monoterpenes is determined primarily by the photoperiod (Picone et al. 2002; Hendel-Rahmanim et al. 2007).|$|R

Vehicle owner should take an appropriate action {{in order to}} reduce pollutant level lower than standard. This study attempts to analyze economic aspect and emission level considerations come into making optimal choice of vehicle owner. First, we examine the influential factors of action taken in maintenance process of non-compliance vehicle on probability of vehicle to pass the second stage <b>emissions</b> <b>test.</b> Second, due to variation of actions taken in the maintenance process, we analyze impact on cost and explore components affects on variation of maintenance cost. Empirical analysis was done by using Inspection and Maintenance data in year 2000 which collected at several auto-mechanic shops in Jakarta city. The bivariate probit model was applied to examine impact of chosen alternatives on the probability to pass Hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide in second <b>emission</b> <b>test.</b> To examine variation of maintenance cost and explore components affects on cost, multilevel approach was applied. It is confirm that several actions may increase probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> but on the same time reduce average cost.

30|$|The {{monoterpene}} emission {{patterns are}} likely to be parallel the expression of structural genes. In A. majus flowers, the terpene backbone biosynthesis pathway, GDPS and monoterpene synthase are all under circadian regulation (Dudareva et al. 2003, 2005; Tholl et al. 2004). The emission of monoterpenes in P. bellina matches the expression patterns of PbGDPS during flower development (Hsiao et al. 2008). Further study of whether these structural genes contribute to the <b>diurnal</b> <b>emission</b> will help to clarify how monoterpene biosynthesis is controlled in a day.|$|R
