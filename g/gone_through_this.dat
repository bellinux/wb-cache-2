25|$|The unsized {{oat groats}} {{pass through a}} heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat groats are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E
