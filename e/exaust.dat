One of the relevant substances for the environment is benzene. In the 1986 clean air directive (TA Luft), benzene is classes as carcinogenic, and an emission limit of 5 mg/m" 3 is imposed. This emission limit is exeeded in the cooling lines in the plant. As there is no economically feasible cleaning procedure to clean large quantities of <b>exaust</b> gas with a in particular low content of organic substances, a biological filter is beeing tested in a large-scale technical trial. In three phases, which are interrupted by improvement and extension work, the trial plant is developed to a successful level.

The influence of rice bran on the decomposition rate has been studied. The temperature in reaction tank rose with the addition of the rice bran. The decomposition rate of sewage sludge increased with a rise in the temperature. It was clarified that the rice bran was added to the sewage sludge to accelerate the decomposition. It is clear from the measurement of carbon dioxide concentration in exhaust that the decomposition reaction reached in the maximum about 12 hours after the beginning of reaction.

The dioxin formation and/or the quenching temperature is revealed using the Altwicker theory equation with the information of inlet gas temperature and droplet spray water. The evaporation rate of a spray water droplet also can be estimated using the Mizutani theory. The highest dioxin formation was found at 350 degrees C; thereafter, it decreased quickly. When an area of 500 microm for droplet-formed dioxins is defined as 100 %, the values of formed dioxins for 400, 300, 200 and 100 microm droplet areas are estimated as 71, 41, 25 and 18 %, respectively.

We systematically study 3 block and 4 block chiral quivers which admit a superconformal fixed point of the RG equation. Most of these theories are known to arise as living on D 3 branes at a singular CY manifold, namely complex cones over del Pezzo surfaces. In the process we find a procedure of getting a new superconformal quiver from a known one. This procedure is termed “shrinking ” and, in the 3 block case, leads {{to the discovery of}} two new models. Thus, the number of superconformal 3 block quivers is 16 rather than the previously known 14. We prove that this list <b>exausts</b> all the possibilities.

40|$|The {{standard}} Hamiltonian machinery, {{being applied}} to field theory, leads to infinite-dimensional phase spaces. It is not covariant. In this article, we present covariant finite-dimensional multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism for field theory. This formalism {{has been developed}} from 70 th as multisymplectic generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism in mechanics. In field theory, multimomentum canonical variables are field functions and momenta corresponding to derivatives of fields with respect all world coordinates, not only the time. In case of regular Lagrangian densities, the multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism {{is equivalent to the}} Lagrangian formalism, otherwise for degenerate Lagrangian densities. In this case, the Euler-Lagrange equations become undetermined and require additional conditions. In gauge theory, they are gauge conditions. In general case, these supplementary conditions remain elusive. In the framework of the multimomentum Hamiltonian machinery, one obtaines them automatically as a part of Hamilton equations. In case of semiregular and almost regular Lagrangian densities, we get comprehensive relations between Lagrangian and multimomentum Hamiltonian formalisms. The key point consists in the fact that, given a degenerate Lagrangian density, one must consider a family of associated multimomentum Hamiltonian forms in order to <b>exaust</b> solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations. We spell out degenerate quadratic and affine Lagrangian densities. The most of field models are of these types. As a result, we get the general procedure of describing constraint field systems. ...|$|E

In order to this, the following substances were measured, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and their derivatives. The analysis of pollution was carried by means of two ways. One of them was the drawing the distribution map of carbon monoxide, from which the detail state of the auto <b>exaust</b> gas on the ground was accounted. Then, the ratios between two components were calculated. First, the ratio of NO₂/NO was considered to show the intluence from the high speed cars. Because, NO is oxidized to NO₂ in the gas bowl including exhaust gas and so the concentration ratio of NO₂ is correspond with the first NOx level and the carried time. Second, the ratio of NOx/CO was found higher according as high speed and counts of Diesel cars. Third, Concerning about hydrocarbons, the ratio (ethylene+acetylene+propylene) / (hexane+toluene) is seemed to indicate the ratio of Diesel car to gasoline car.

Virtulaly the entire area was littered with historic trash and there were sparse scatters of prehistoric lithic debris as well. This area was recorded as multi-component site 41 ZP 965. Due to the extent of disturbance over the entire APE, {{it was not possible to}} identify the source area of the cultural materials. The prehistoric scatter probably represents a limited use area that included limited activities and a possible camp. A probable metate fragment and unifacial scraper suggests plant procurement and preparation. An <b>exausted</b> core, and flakes representing all reduction stages are indicators of tool and blade manufacture. The scraper may have been used to process Agave and other similar plants. The historic trash scatter covers most of the entire tract. Types observed are bottles and bottle fragments, ceramics, colored glass, window glass, and a coffee tin lid. The historic component could represent a dump that was pushed when the area was cleared of vegetation. The area could also be the site of a former house, line shack, or store.

Italian men and women (N= 91) working as bank consultants or at the counter were administered a questionnaire comprising several scales, plus questions on sociodemographic and work-related variables. The results showed that Emotional labour (Hochschild 1983; Grandey 1999) is a relevant variable of such jobs: Workers perform both (a) surface acting (SA), i. e., vis-a-vis a client express only contextually appropriate emotions (for example, by smiling to an annoying client), and (b) deep acting (DA), i. e., try to actually feel the required emotion; (c) feeling genuine emotions (GE), i. e., effortlessly feeling the required emotions, is a frequent experience too. SA, not surprisingly, is negatively related to GE. As regards the main correlates of emotional labour measured in this study, results showed that feeling GE tended to be less likely the longer the interaction with a client; the frequency of interactions was related significantly to emotional labour too: negatively as regards GE, positively as regards SA. Likewise, GE was less likely the higher the number of years spent in the present job position. Life satisfaction (Diener 1984) was related negatively to SA, positively relation GE.

The impacts of five different emissions were investigated: Road traffic exhaust, split into Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) and Heavy Duty Vehicles(HDV), Sea Traffic, Power Plants and Residential Heating. The emissions from non-exhaust (mainly road wear due to use of studded tyres) were also treated, in addition to combustion sources. The uncertainties in the emission estimates for Residential Heating using biomass (wood) are very large {{but it seems that}} it is an important PM source in Stockholm. In this report two estimates of the emissions have been used. In the lowest estimate, which seems more realistic, the contribution to population exposure of directly emitted combustion particles from residential heating is of similar magnitude (37 %) as the contribution from road traffic <b>exaust</b> (42 %). For all sources, except Sea Traffic, the total population exposure to combustion PM is much larger within Stockholm than outside; for shipping the total exposure is about as large outside the city as within. For all sources, except residential heating, the secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) exposure is higher than the combustion particle exposure. Non-exhaust particles dominate the total impact on PM 10 exposure, contributing about 60 - 70 % to the total exposure, due to all the studied sources in Stockholm.

40|$|The {{world as}} we know it today is full of {{technical}} equipment that requires energy of some sort, let it be oil, gas or electricity. With an increasing growth of the earth s population, as well as a boost in the general standard of living, it is certain that the total energy need will increase. To meet these demands one must utilize all the research available to develop the new era renewable energy and environmentally friendly technology. Solar energy is without a doubt one of the most certain sources of energy that will become a large supplier of consumer energy in the future. Thus it is important to keep on researching new ways to increase the efficiency of today s solar photovoltaic (PV) applications and keep lowering the cost of such technology. This master s thesis has studied a building-applied PV system in Norway and investigated how well the technology performs during partial shading conditions. The PV system studied in this thesis is that of Powerhouse Kjørbo in Sandvika, near the capital Oslo. Powerhouse Kjørbo is an old rehabilitated office building and is Norway s first energy-positive office building, in its third year of operation. The building, consisting of two blocks, is meant to produce more energy than it uses for materials, production, operation, renovation and demolition during the whole of its lifetime. The energy is produced by solar panels installed at the two rooftops and on the top of a nearby parking complex. The work began with gaining information about and understanding of the Powerhouse Kjørbo PV system and how it might be affected by partial shading. Prior to performing measurements and experimental and simulation studies of the Powerhouse Kjørbo system, a week of inspection was done at the site. Soiling of the modules by bird droppings and other pollution particles was observed as a potential factor for losses It was also found sources for cast shadows among others a vent pipe, a steel safety wire and a mussel shell lying on the surface. The findings became the background for the conducted shading experiments and simulations. The results from the experimental and simulation study were then used to estimate the impacts of selected cast shadows, and finally, on-site measurements at Powerhouse Kjørbo were conducted to compare to the previous findings. It was found that cleaning of strings of PV modules resulted in an increased daily energy yield by up to 11 %, compared to uncleaned modules under the same environmental conditions. It was also found that all of the identified sources of partial shading had a visible impact corresponding well to what was found during the experimental and simulation studies. When analyzing the shading impacts, the I-V curve has been shown to be most useful, where the main indicator of reduced potential power production is the short-circuit current. The simulation models have been verified by real-life measurements, and proven to need some upgrades to represent a fully realistic model of a PV module or system. When measurements were performed at the PK system, it was found that the worst drop in power occurs when shading modules on their short edge. The partial shading source that had the greatest impact was shown to be an <b>exaust</b> vent, causing a power reduction of nearly 20 % on a string level...|$|E
40|$|To what extent, in what {{context and}} with what {{psychological}} consequences do service workers regulate their emotions {{so that they are}} in line with their job requirements? To answer these questions 30 Italian men and 71 women (22 - 61 years of age) mostly working at the counter at various branches of the Post Office located in the Veneto region were administered a questionnaire comprising several scales, as well as questions on sociodemographic and work-related variables. The results showed that Emotional labour (Hochschild 1983; Grandey 1999) is a relevant variable of post office service jobs: Workers perform both (a) surface acting, i. e., control the expression of their emotions vis-a-vis a client so that they are contextually appropriate (for example, they smile to an annoying client), and (b) deep acting, i. e., try to actually feel the required emotion; (c) feeling genuine emotions, i. e., the employee effortlessly feels the required emotions, is however also a frequent experience in these service jobs. Surface acting, not surprisingly, is negatively related to feeling genuine emotions. As regards the correlates of emotional labour that were measured in this study, the following main results were obtained. Feeling genuine emotions was found to be related positively to Life satisfaction (Diener 1984), but negatively to Job realization, Emotional exaustion, and Depersonalization (i. e., the burnout components; older subjects tend to report higher burnout levels). Subjects who feel frequently genuine emotions also reported a lower frequency of Negative affect (measured by a modified version of Panas; Watson et al. 1988) in their life in the past two weeks, and a greater frequency of Positive affect - the latter in turn was positively related to Life satisfaction. Surface acting was instead positively related to Emotional exaustion and Depersonalization (similar results were obtained for deep acting, but {{it should be noted that}} in this study there was a high positive correlation between deep and surface acting). Emotionally <b>exausted</b> and depersonalized subjects felt a low level of Job realization, and reported little life satisfaction, a high frequency of Negative affect, and a low frequency of Positive affect. In general no significant differences between men and women, or as a function of civil status and number of children were observed - there were exceptions to this trend; for instance, women feel genuine emotions more than men, whereas the opposite is true for surface acting; women with children perform more deep acting than women without children; older subjects perfom less surface acting than younger ones). Not supported, too, were the hypotheses that feeling genuine emotions is less likely the longer the interactions with clients, or the more frequent they are. Finally, the higher the number of years spent in the present job position the greater their Job Involvement and Work Realization, but coupled with a higher depersonalization feeling. Finally, the results showed that subjects who report high social desirability scores tend to report feeling more often genuine emotions, performing more deep acting, and being more satisfied with their life than subjects who obtain low social desirability scores. Implications of this study for future research on the construct of emotional labour, and on its correlates, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Esta tese de doutorado busca encontrar o Não-lugar, ponto de partida e de chegada a partir do qual escreveram os filósofos neoplatônicos Plotino, Jâmblico e Damáscio, ao se depararem com a Presença Inefável Daquele que nos atrai com o seu Silêncio e que, ao invés de se calarem, tornam-se loquazes indicadores do que se esconde por trás do que é dito e que linguagem alguma consegue contemplar sem trair a si própria. Começaremos por investigar, na primeira parte deste estudo, a linguagem catafática e apofática de Plotino (1 º e 2 º Capítulos, respectivamente) a partir da exegese do Parmênides de Platão, especialmente a primeira hipótese. A partir do Um de Plotino vislumbraremos o aspecto enigmático da linguagem mística até entendermos, com Plotino, tratar-se de outra maneira de ver aquela de quem contempla o mais alto e que a linguagem mística alude através de recursos gramaticais, tais como os advérbios de lugar e superlativos, e que se concretizam através da linguagem do Amor, cuja brecha abre fendas por meio das quais nos comunicamos, o que é possível por meio de imagens, metáforas e analogias até sermos forçados a utilizar a linguagem negativa, apofática e afairética. O Parmênides de Platão, como um divisor de águas, aproximou - à distância - as perspectivas de nossos interlocutores tecendo uma trama invisível, a mesma que vislumbrávamos existir desde o início, mas que desconhecíamos o nome, que veio a se revelar a nós de modo simples e instantâneo, porque estava ali presente, em cada um deles, à sua maneira. Na segunda parte deste estudo trabalharemos a linguagem da Transcendência. A maneira muito {{particular}} como cada um deles desenvolveu um corpo filosófico próprio, a partir das hipóteses do Parmênides, revela aquilo mesmo que o diálogo pretende suscitar: o percurso ascético tanto do discípulo (para Plotino) quanto do peregrino (para Jâmblico). Em seu limite, a aporia realiza, no discurso de Damáscio (3 º capítulo), uma inversão, por meio da qual a linguagem se contorce e inverte até a mais completa exaustão quando, abandonando tudo o que havíamos agregado ao pensar, nos encontramos sós e diante de nosso nada. Sem mais nada, diante do abismo, neste instante, arremeçados adiante porque ainda não havíamos encontrado o Não-lugar encontramos Jâmblico (4 º capítulo), que nos brinda com a possibilidade de retorno, não mais através de nossos esforços, mas, inspirado pelos Oráculos Caldáicos, na teurgia como complemento da filosofia e não em oposição à mesma, tendo ido até o extremo em que esta pode nos conduzir, no diálogo com o Parmênides de Platão, promove uma mudança do paradigma parmenideano de Platão, revelando aquilo que lhe coube trazer à luz e que estava antes encoberto, o que só o instante pode revelarThis Doctoral Dissertation {{seeks to}} find the No-Where, starting and finishing point whence the Neoplatonic philosophers - Plotinus, Iamblichus and Damascius - wrote, {{when faced with the}} Ineffable Presence of That One which attracts us with Its Silence and Who, instead of silencing, becomes loquacious indicators of that which hides behind that which is said and that which no language is able to contemplate without betraying itself. We will start by investigating, in Part I, Plotinus Cataphatic and Apophatic languages (Chapters One and Two, respectively) from the exegesis of Plato s Parmenides, especially its first hypotheses. Departing from Plotinus One we will analyze the enigmatic aspect of mystical language until we understand, with Plotinus, that it is just another manner for seeing that which those who contemplate the highest and whose mystical language alludes to, through grammar resources, such as the adverbs of place and superlatives, embodied through the language of Love, whose breach opens cracks through which we communicate something that is possible by means of images, metaphors and analogies, until we are forced to use the so called negative, apophatic or aphairetic language. Plato s Parmenides, as a turning point, united at a distance - the perspectives of our interlocutors weaving thus, in an invisible woof, the same we supposed existed from the very beginning, but whose name we did not know, but which revealed itself to us in a simple and instantaneous manner, because it was there, present, in each one of them, its own way. In Part II of this work, we will work the language of Transcendence. The very specific way each one of them developed a personal philosophical corpus departing from the hypotheses of Plato s Parmenides reveals that very thing that the dialog intends to arouse: the ascetic course both of the disciple (for Plotinus) and of the pilgrim (for Iamblichus). In its limit, the aporia brings about, in Damascius discourse (Chapter Three), an inversion, by means of which language twist and turns itself until it becomes utterly <b>exausted</b> when, leaving everything that had been aggregated to thought, we find ourselves all alone, faced with our nothingness. With nothing left, before the abyss, in this instant, hurled forward because we still had not found the No-Where, we meet Iamblichus (Chapter Four), which presents us with the chance of returning, no more by means of our own efforts, but, inspired by the Caldaic Oracles, through Teurgy as complement to Philosophy and not in opposition to it, having reached the limit to which the latter had led us, in the dialog with Plato s Parmenides, it promotes a shift in Plato s Parmenidean paradigm, revealing that which it was supposed to give birth to, and which was beforehand veiled, and which is up to the instant to revea...|$|R
