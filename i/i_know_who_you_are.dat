6000|$|... "You've deceived me!" [...] I cried sternly. [...] "Jack, you've {{given me}} a false name. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> now. You're no Jack at all. You're Courtenay Ivor!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Doubt not my faith, sir,' said Eustacie, proudly; 'I {{have been}} as true to him as if I had known he lived. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to {{question}} me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MacIan screamed. [...] "Ah!" [...] he cried. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are. You are not God. You are {{not one of}} God's angels. But {{you were}} once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are?' {{she asked}} him, carelessly. 'How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{what you want}} to know my story for? Perhaps you're only trying to get {{something}} out of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} seen him here to-day. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> mean well enough, {{but he is not}} here. I can lay you the odds if you like. You would be safe with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} I have met you," [...] said Olive, [...] "and that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> And I am glad, too, {{to tell you}} that I forgive you for not taking notice of me seven years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon not. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> {{and that}} you are an old {{associate}} of hers, {{in the days of}} her sin and unregeneration. I want you to answer me, before God and man, what was your purpose in coming there to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does--oh! it does. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> I find no {{difficulty}} in tracing in your features the resemblance to your portrait {{in the family}} gallery, at the Nest. The eyes, too, cannot be altered without artificial brows, and those you have not." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "What is thy name? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> thy quality." [...] - [...] Montjoy asks him, [...] "You {{know from}} my {{clothing}} who I am." [...] Then, Henry says, [...] "Well then, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who goes there?" [...] he cried, in a high-pitched, nervous voice. [...] "Don't come {{any closer}} until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] and {{he raised his}} pistol and pointed it at those who approached.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm Belding, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] replied Belding in hearty amaze, as he {{stretched}} forth his big hand. [...] "You're Dick Gale's Dad--the Governor, Dick used to say. I'm sure glad to meet you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, Madame, {{welcome to}} it all--welcome as the flowers in May. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> though I forget your name; it {{is a name}} dear to all La Vendée. Your husband is a great and good man; indeed, you shall have my bed, though you'll find it very cold. Your husband--but, oh dear! I beg your pardon, Madame, I forgot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who are you, anyhow," [...] {{he cried}} out, [...] "to {{threaten}} to strike {{me and to}} insult me, who am as good as you? You dare not strike me! You may shoot a man from behind, as you shot poor Captain Brand on the Rio Cobra River, but you won't dare strike me face to face. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and what you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who are you, anyhow," [...] he cries, {{his voice}} mightily hoarse {{even in his}} own ears, [...] "to {{threaten}} to strike me! You may be a bloody pirate, and you may shoot a man from behind, as you shot poor Captain Brand on the Cobra River, but you won't dare strike me face to face. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and what you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kent," [...] he continued, [...] "from {{the first}} moment of your mock investigation, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were. Your every step was shadowed, your every {{movement}} dogged. Transome Kent--by your true name, Peter Kelly, murderer, I denounce you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum, where Jesus exorcises an evil spirit who cries out, [...] "What do {{you want}} with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are—the Holy One of God!".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> must be {{the very}} first moment I saw you," [...] she answered, blushing; [...] "you're so much like him in some ways, though not in all.... And {{he told me that}} day he had a twin brother." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN. I know that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> And the earth-shaking {{part of it}} to me is {{that though}} you were placed in that {{enormously}} responsible position, neither I nor anyone else knows what your beliefs are, or even whether you have either beliefs or principles. What we did know was that your Government was formed largely of men who regarded you as a robber of henroosts, and whom you regarded as enemies of the people.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{take back}} my {{invitation}} for a week!' cried the Prince. 'Now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> you must {{stay with me}} for a long time. I wish you could stay always,' he added, his eyes still fixed upon the beautiful young woman. Then, as if to explain this outburst of interest, he said: 'You know, I rely so much on your advice and counsel, and there is no knowing what that Dowager may do next.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll take them, will you?' said he. 'You're a very leery cove, by {{the look}} of you, but I can tell you that you've got the wrong sow by the ear this time. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> You're a runaway Frenchy, from the prison yonder, as anyone could tell with half an eye. But you don't know who I am, else you wouldn't try such a plant as that. Why, man, I'm the Bristol Bustler, nine stone champion, and them's my {{training}} quarters down yonder.' ...|$|E
50|$|In May 2008 {{the track}} <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> Could Be from Profit In Your Poetry, was used inthe US TV drama series Moonlight. The song {{can be heard}} during the final scene of episode 14, which was edited so that the song {{could be used in}} its entirety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph; don't <b>you</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are?" [...] he went on. [...] "You're {{the son of}} a thief. Do {{you hear}} that?-- {{the son of a}} thief! What right have you got to set {{yourself}} up to be any better than your father was afore you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{returned}} Wisbech, [...] "then <b>I</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> must be. In fact, I'm rather glad I {{came across}} you. You are evidently {{the man who}} looked after my nephew when he was ill, and from what Miss Waynefleet told me, Derrick owes you a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave lady," [...] {{answered}} the bird, [...] "do not blame me for having joined my voice {{to those who}} did their best to preserve my freedom. Although confined in a cage, I was content with my lot, but if I must become a slave, I could not wish for a nobler mistress than one who has shown so much constancy, and from this moment I swear to serve you faithfully. Some day you will put me to the proof, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> better than you do yourself. Meanwhile, tell me what I can do, and I will obey you." ...|$|E
60|$|But the Prince {{knew what}} he wanted, and when the old witch {{saw that he had}} made up his mind to have the foal, she said, 'I am obliged to keep my promise and to hand you over the foal; and as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and what you want, I will tell you in what way the animal will be useful to you. The man in the {{cauldron}} of boiling pitch, whom you set free, is a mighty magician; through your curiosity and thoughtlessness Militza came into his power, and he has transported her and her castle and belongings into a distant country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you come}} here, white men," [...] he asked, [...] "uninvited and against the law of my land, where only one white man is welcome, my brother Dogeetah, who cured me of {{sickness}} with a knife? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> You are dealers in men. You come here to steal my people and sell them into slavery. You had many slaves {{with you on the}} borders of my country, but you sent them away. You shall die, you shall die, you who call yourselves lions, and the painted rag which you say shadows the world, shall rot with your bones. As for that box which sings a war-song, I will smash it; it shall not bewitch me as your magic shield bewitched my great doctor, Imbozwi, burning off his hair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maiden," [...] replied Maduna, in a shamed voice, [...] "that {{was your}} fault, not mine. If you had {{appealed to me}} I would have let you go. But you killed my sentry, and then the chase began, and ere <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were my runners were out of call." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charrisse: “If <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, then you're {{not worth}} knowing.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{called the}} Su-dic, which {{is short for}} Supreme Dictator. I sent that man away because the moment you {{mentioned}} Ozma of Oz, and the Emerald City, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are. <b>I</b> suppose I'm the only Flathead that ever heard of you, but that's because I have more brains than the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have changed}} since we met last, young sir," [...] {{she said with a}} smile, [...] "though it is but a month since. Then you were a 'prentice boy, now you are an esquire of Sir Walter Manny, and on the highway to distinction. That you will win it I am well assured, since one who risked his life to rescue a woman and child whose very names were unknown to him is sure to turn out a noble and valiant knight. I little thought when my {{daughter}} called you her knight, that in so short a time you might become an aspirant to that honour. I hope that you do not look askance at us, now that you know I am in possession of the lands of your parents. Such changes of land, you know, often occur, but now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> I would that the estates bestowed upon Sir Jasper had belonged to some other than you; however, I trust that you will hold no grudge against us, and that you may win as fair an estate by the strength of your arm and the king's favour." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] he replied, without moving. [...] "You are Caroline, Duchess of Winchester. I keep my hat upon my head because I owe you {{no respect}} and I feel none. As to asking you in, {{no one of}} your family will ever, of my will, step inside these palings." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Makes no answer, {{but remains}} standing. There is a pause. Then {{the eyes of}} the two women meet. LADY CHILTERN looks stern and pale. MRS. CHEVELEY seem rather amused.] Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really were, <b>I</b> should not have invited you to my house last night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] said my companion, with my card in his hand. [...] "Fact is, I was {{round at}} your place this morning {{trying to get}} rooms, and the clerk {{told me all about}} you from my description. I felt as mean as pu'sley goin'; seemed to be takin' kind of an {{advantage}} of you." ...|$|R
