5|$|A <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> {{constructed}} of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E
25|$|In optics, a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> is {{an optical}} {{component}} {{with a regular}} pattern, which diffracts light into several beams.

The first man-made <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> was made around 1785 by Philadelphia inventor David Rittenhouse, who strung hairs between two finely threaded screws.

50|$|Another {{method for}} {{manufacturing}} <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> uses a photosensitive gel sandwiched between two substrates. A holographic interference pattern exposes the gel which is later developed. These gratings, called volume phase holography <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> (or VPH <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings)</b> have no physical grooves, but instead a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the gel. This removes {{much of the}} surface scattering effects typically seen in other types of gratings. These gratings also tend to have higher efficiencies, and allow {{for the inclusion of}} complicated patterns into a single grating. In older versions of such gratings, environmental susceptibility was a trade-off, as the gel had to be contained at low temperature and humidity. Typically, the photosensitive substances are sealed between two substrates which make them resistant to humidity, thermal and mechanical stresses. VPH <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> are not destroyed by accidental touches and are more scratch resistant than typical relief gratings.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} we have fabricated and investigated two kinds of surface relief <b>gratings</b> (phase <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings),</b> formed with standard photolithography combined with the plasma-etching and reactive ion etching (RIE). Diffraction efficiency of <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> (originally produced in silicon and quartz glass substrates) was measured experimentally and estimated using linear dimensions of gratings defined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The main experimental results were compared with the computer simulations where the standard software (“PCGrate 2000 MLT ” and “GSolver”) were employed to calculate diffraction efficiency of different period of <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> for the different wavelengths of visible light. Comparing two evaluation methods: direct (scanning probe microscopy) and indirect (diffraction efficiency) we have demonstrated feasibility of optical methods in control of geometrical dimensions of gratings at the microscopic range.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} shallow <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> for quadrature phase interferometry. A single shallow diffraction grating-based Michelson interferometer yields only trivial (0 ° or 180 °) phase shift between different output ports. In comparison, a combination of two parallel shallow <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> can be useful to achieve desired phase shifts (e. g., 90 ° for quadrature phase interferometry). We show that the phase at different output ports of a grating-pair based interferometer can be adjusted by shearing the two gratings with respect to each other. Two harmonically-related <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> are used to demonstrate phase shift control at the output ports of a modified Michelson interferometer.

25|$|The {{periodic}} {{structure of}} a crystalline solid acts as a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating,</b> scattering the electrons in a predictable manner.

However, the technique is limited by phase problem.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commonly}} {{confused with}} diffraction gratings are the iridescent colors of peacock feathers, mother-of-pearl, and butterfly wings. Iridescence in birds, fish and insects is often caused by thin-film interference {{rather than a}} <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating.</b> Diffraction will produce the entire spectrum of colors as the viewing angle changes, whereas thin-film interference usually produces a much narrower range. The surfaces of flowers can also create a diffraction, but the cell structures in plants are usually too irregular to produce the fine slit geometry necessary for a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating.</b> The iridescence signal of flowers is thus only appreciable very locally and hence not visible to man and flower visiting insects. However, natural gratings do occur in some invertebrate marine animals, like the antennae of seed shrimp, and have even been discovered in Burgess Shale fossils.|$|E

25|$|In optics, a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> is {{an optical}} {{component}} with a periodic structure, which splits and diffracts light into several beams travelling in different directions.

25|$|In astronomy, stellar {{classification}} is {{the classification}} of stars based on their spectral characteristics. Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with absorption lines. Each line indicates an ion of a certain chemical element, with the line strength indicating the abundance of that ion. The relative abundance of the different ions varies with {{the temperature of the}} photosphere. The spectral class of a star is a short code summarizing the ionization state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature and density.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} seen in meteorology. Diffraction coronas are colorful rings surrounding {{a source of}} light, such as the sun. These are usually observed {{much closer to the}} light source than halos, and are caused by very fine particles, like water droplets, ice crystals, or smoke particles in a hazy sky. When the particles are all nearly the same size they diffract the incoming light at very specific angles. The exact angle depends {{on the size of the}} particles. Diffraction coronas are commonly observed around light sources, like candle flames or street lights, in the fog. Cloud iridescence is caused by diffraction, occurring along coronal rings when the particles in the clouds are all uniform in size.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. This is certainly not the case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E
