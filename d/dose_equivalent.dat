5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{exposure}} {{varies from}} place to place but delivers a <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> in the vicinity of 2.4mSv/year, or about 0.3µSv/h. For comparison, one chest x-ray is about 0.2mSv and an abdominal CT scan is supposed to be less than 10mSv (but {{it has been reported that}} some abdominal CT scans can deliver as much as 90mSv).

25|$|In {{countries}} with nuclear power, radioactive wastes comprise less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, {{much of which}} remains hazardous for long periods. Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants. Coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal. A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent,</b> or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 {{times as much as}} from the operation of nuclear plants. Indeed, coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis, but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated, and this is released directly into the environment as fly ash, whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials, for example, in dry cask storage vessels.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absorbed dose}} and <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> from {{galactic cosmic rays}} and solar {{energetic}} particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions {{to the surface of}} Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. [...] This study estimates that a few meters drill is necessary to access possible biomolecules. [...] The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. [...] Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.|$|E

2500|$|The {{health effects}} of the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear {{accident}} are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low. The American Nuclear Society concluded that average local radiation exposure was equivalent to a chest X-ray, and maximum local exposure equivalent to less than a year's background radiation. The U.S. BEIR report on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation states that [...] "he collective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> resulting from the radioactivity released in the Three Mile Island accident was so low that the estimated number of excess cancer cases to be expected, if any were to occur, would be negligible and undetectable."

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 06:00 JST on 15 March, {{an explosion}} damaged the 4th floor rooftop {{area of the}} Unit 4 reactor as well {{as part of the}} adjacent Unit 3. The explosion is thought to be caused by the ignition of hydrogen that had accumulated near the spent fuel pond, the hydrogen was initially thought to have come from the stored fuel rods, but later, TEPCO believed the hydrogen came from Unit 3. A hand-written summary of a conference call, taken by an aide to then-Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman Gregory Jazcko, stated that fuel could have been ejected from the Unit 4 spent fuel pond during this explosion; this was later found to be in error. Later reports that the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had caught fire were found to be erroneous; later reports clarified that the fire did not involve the fuel pool. Current versions of the IAEA report do not mention a fire (as of 6/2014, the logs of the fuel transfer process from the Unit 4 SFP to the common fuel pool indicate steady progress with no fuel damage reported). As radiation levels rose, some of the employees still at the plant were evacuated. On the morning of 15 March, Secretary Edano announced that according to the TEPCO, radiation <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rates measured from the Unit 4 reached 100 mSv/h. Edano said there was no continued release of [...] "high radiation".|$|E
2500|$|Coal is a {{sedimentary}} rock formed primarily from accumulated plant matter, {{and it includes}} many inorganic minerals and elements which were deposited along with organic material during its formation. [...] As {{the rest of the}} Earth's crust, coal also contains low levels of uranium, thorium, and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes whose release into the environment leads to radioactive contamination. While these substances are present as very small trace impurities, enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released. A 1,000 MW coal-burning power plant could have an uncontrolled release of as much as 5.2 metric tons per year of uranium (containing [...] of uranium-235) and 12.8 metric tons per year of thorium. In comparison, a 1,000 MW nuclear plant will generate about 30 metric tons of high-level radioactive solid packed waste per year. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much uncontrolled radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. The collective radioactivity resulting from all coal burning worldwide between 1937 and 2040 is estimated to be 2,700,000 curies or 0.101 EBq. During normal operation, the effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> from coal plants is 100 times that from nuclear plants. Normal operation however, is a deceiving baseline for comparison: just the Chernobyl nuclear disaster released, in iodine-131 alone, an estimated 1.76 EBq [...] of radioactivity, a value one order of magnitude above this value for total emissions from all coal burned within a century, while the iodine-131, the major radioactive substance which comes out in accident situations, has a half life of just 8 days.|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} online: January 5, 2015 Peripheral photon and neutron doses {{from external}} beam radiotherapy (EBRT) are associated with increased risk of carcinogenesis in the out-of-field organs; thus, dose estimations of secondary radiation are imperative. Peripheral photon and neutron doses from EBRT of prostate carcinoma were measured in Rando phantom. (6) LiF:Mg,Cu,P and (7) LiF:Mg,Cu,P glass-rod thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs) were inserted in slices of a Rando phantom followed by exposure to 80 Gy with 18 -MV photon four-field 3 D-CRT technique. The TLDs were calibrated using 6 - and 18 -MV X-ray beam. Neutron <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> measured with CR- 39 etch-track detectors were used to derive readout-to-neutron dose conversion factor for (6) LiF:Mg,Cu,P TLDs. Average neutron <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> per 1 Gy of isocentre dose were 3. 8 ± 0. 9 mSv Gy(- 1) for thyroid and 7. 0 ± 5. 4 mSv Gy(- 1) for colon.

2500|$|Human {{epidemiology}} {{studies show}} that nicotine use is not a significant cause of cardiovascular disease. A 2015 review found that nicotine is associated with cardiovascular disease. A 2016 review suggests that [...] "the risks of nicotine without tobacco combustion products (cigarette smoke) are low compared to cigarette smoking, but are still of concern in people with cardiovascular disease." [...] Some studies in people show the possibility that nicotine contributes to acute cardiovascular events in smokers with established cardiovascular disease, and induces pharmacologic effects that might contribute to increased atherosclerosis. Prolonged nicotine use seems not to increase atherosclerosis. Brief nicotine use, such as nicotine medicine, seems to incur a slight cardiovascular risk, even to people with established cardiovascular disease. A 2015 review found [...] "Nicotine in vitro and in animal models can inhibit apoptosis and enhance angiogenesis, effects that raise concerns {{about the role of}} nicotine in promoting the acceleration of atherosclerotic disease." [...] A 2012 Cochrane review found no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease with nicotine replacement products. A 1996 randomized controlled trial using nicotine patches found that serious adverse events were not more frequent among smokers with cardiovascular disease. A meta-analysis shows that snus consumption, which delivers nicotine at a <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to that of cigarettes, is not associated with heart attacks. Hence, it is not nicotine, but tobacco smoke's other components which seem to be implicated in ischemic heart disease. Nicotine increases heart rate and blood pressure and induces abnormal heart rhythms. Nicotine can also induce potentially atherogenic genes in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Microvascular injury can result through its action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Nicotine does not adversely affect serum cholesterol levels, but a 2015 review found it may elevate serum cholesterol levels. Many quitting smoking studies using nicotine medicines report lowered dyslipidemia with considerable benefit in HDL/LDL ratios. Nicotine supports clot formation and aids in plaque formation by enhancing vascular smooth muscle.|$|E
