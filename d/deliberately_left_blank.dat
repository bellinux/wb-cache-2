50|$|When the {{building}} on Number 13, {{on the corner}} to Köpmangatan, was built in 1768, a small space {{in front of it}} was <b>deliberately</b> <b>left</b> <b>blank</b> to allow space for horses carriages to turn. The building's rounded corner, the detailing in the façade and portico, and parts of the interior, are the best preserved example of the Rococo estates of the Bourgeoisie during that era.|$|E
50|$|Custom coffins are {{occasionally}} {{created and}} some companies also make set ranges with non-traditional designs. These include printing or painting of peaceful tropical scenes, sea-shells, sunsets, cherubs and patriotic flags. Some manufacturers have designed {{them to look}} like gym carry bags, guitar cases, cigar humidors, and even yellow dumpster bins. Other coffins are <b>left</b> <b>deliberately</b> <b>blank</b> so that friends and family can inscribe final wishes and thoughts upon them to the deceased. In Taiwan, coffins made of crushed oyster shells {{were used in the}} 18th and 19th centuries.In the 1990s, the rock group Kiss released a customized Kiss Kasket, which featured their trademark makeup designs and KISS logo and could also be used as a cooler. Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell was buried in one.|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed by Placebo's Brian Molko for Les Inrockuptibles magazine, Smith {{said that}} Trey Parker and Matt Stone sent him the script, but <b>deliberately</b> <b>left</b> some {{portions}} <b>blank</b> [...] "to keep the surprise. They didn't {{want anybody to}} know, they wanted to shock. When I saw myself, I found it surrealistic." [...] In another interview set up by Entertainment Weekly, Smith described the process to Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy: [...] I {{stayed up all night}} and went into this radio station and recorded my words down a phone line. I had no idea what it was all about. I had one of them {{on the other end of}} the line directing me, saying, [...] "Please sound more like Robert Smith. Come on!" [...] About six months later I saw it and I was completely thrown by what they had done with it. [...] He told Wentz that the [...] "Disintegration is the best album ever!" [...] scene was [...] "one of my greatest moments in life".|$|R
25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might help explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is <b>left</b> <b>deliberately</b> <b>blank</b> here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name.|$|R
