5|$|After the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge.</b> Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{migrant workers}} started to arrive from 1992 onwards {{due to the}} {{creation}} of new job opportunities by the UNTAC administration. At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as FUNCINPEC and the BLDP began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the 1993 general elections. In November 1992, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. The first guerrilla-style attacks by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> soldiers justified the killings by claiming that some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in disguise. The spate of killings by <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.|$|E

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt {{an attempt by the}} Vietnamese to dominate them, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which {{was in the process of}} seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and China.|$|E
5|$|In March 1992, {{the start}} of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which {{included}} troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers. The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi. In June 1992, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement. Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia. Towards the end of 1992, <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In {{the months leading up to}} the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, {{because of}} the cut of US aid, all the republican government's leaders wanted to stop the war without conditions. However, Fernandez refused to {{negotiate}} with the <b>Khmers</b> <b>rouges</b> if the government would make FANK lay down their arms during the negotiation; for this reason, he resigned as army chief. The government let the <b>Khmer</b> <b>rouges</b> take Phnom Penh without real battle for the purpose of negotiation.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{he was a}} general and the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> chief-of-staff. He was {{also a member of}} the Standing Committee of the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> Central Committee ("Party Center") during its period in power. He became very {{powerful}} within the party, especially in the south-west zone. He was named by Pol Pot as leader of the national army of Democratic Kampuchea. He lost the lower part of one leg in fighting around 1970.|$|R
50|$|Arguable {{examples}} include the destruction of Dresden {{at the end of}} World War II and the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> destruction in Cambodia.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E

50|$|Between 327,000 and 541,000 {{ethnic and}} {{religious}} minorities in Cambodia are estimated to {{have been killed by}} the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> genocides against them.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vietnamese {{invasion}} of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, {{who were the}} <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> political ally, launched a punitive invasion of Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the capital, Vietnamese units {{continued}} their advance in two columns into western Cambodia, capturing Battambang and Siemréap. The columns met at Sisophon and drove on to the Thai border, where there was heavy fighting in March and in April. In the meantime, some remaining <b>Khmers</b> <b>rouges</b> units offered scattered resistance before they melted away into less accessible areas. There the <b>Khmer</b> <b>rouges</b> leaders soon rekindled an insurgency against the new government in power, just as they had in the late 1960s, and insecurity persisted in the countryside in spite of the continued Vietnamese presence.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|The other non-communist {{organisation}} was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, {{formed by}} Sihanouk and {{known by its}} French acronym FUNCINPEC. The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea’s seat at the UN vacant {{on the basis that}} neither the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people. He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of savage fighting, the Republican {{government}} was defeated on 17 April 1975 when the victorious <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> proclaimed the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea.|$|E
5000|$|... 28-30 January: Vietnamese {{artillery}} fired {{about one}} hundred 130mm shells, mortars and rockets at {{positions of the}} <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> 320th Division near the Khao Din Refugee Camp about 34 miles south of Aranyaprathet. This was followed by an infantry assault on Khao Ta-ngoc.|$|R
50|$|The Vietnamese {{sweeping}} through Cambodia {{produced an}} unprecedented level of turmoil on the Thai border, as disorganised and by-passed <b>Khmers</b> <b>rouges</b> units and civilian refugees fled before their advancing enemy. Amid this chaos, in 1979, two anti-Vietnamese insurgent movements, besides the <b>Khmer</b> <b>rouges,</b> came into being. The {{first of these}} was the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF - see Appendix B), the armed wing of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLAF - see Appendix B), which gave allegiance to Son Sann, a non-communist, perennial cabinet minister in successive Sihanouk administrations. The other was the Sihanouk National Army (Armée nationale sihanoukiste - ANS - see Appendix B), the armed wing of the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Co-operative Cambodia (Front uni national pour un Cambodge indépendant, neutre, pacifique, et coopératif - FUNCINPEC - see Appendix B), which owed allegiance to Sihanouk. Fighting independently, these noncommunist guerrilla movements and the <b>Khmers</b> <b>rouges</b> fomented continuous rebellion in the early 1980s {{that could not be}} quelled, despite a substantial Vietnamese military commitment to this purpose. Operating from refugee camps on the Thai frontier, the insurgents made forays into the Cambodian border provinces and kept the countryside in a permanent state of insecurity.|$|R
50|$|After 1975, the PMLI {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with the Communist Party of Kampuchea, even after the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam. A PMLI leader visited a CPK-controlled zone of Cambodia in 1987. After Pol Pot's arrest in 1997, the PMLI denounced the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> betrayal.|$|R
5|$|Agent Orange {{was used}} as a {{defoliant}} in eastern Cambodia during the Vietnam War, but its impacts are difficult to assess due to the chaos caused by the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> regime.|$|E
5|$|In September 1982, Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS) {{was formed}} by the merger of several pro-FUNCINPEC {{resistance}} armies, including MOULINAKA. However, ties between FUNCINPEC with the KPNLF and <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> remained tenuous. On the one hand, Son Sann publicly criticised Sihanouk on several occasions, while on the other hand, the <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> army periodically attacked the ANS, prompting Sihanouk in threatening to quit as CGDK's president {{on at least two}} occasions in June 1983 and July 1985. In December 1987, Sihanouk met with the Prime Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen in France. The following year in July 1988, the first informal meeting was held in Jakarta, Indonesia between the four warring Cambodian factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> KPNLF and the PRK government. The meetings were held with a view to end the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, and two additional meetings were later held which became known as the Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIM).|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese were {{slaughtered}} {{and dumped}} in the Mekong River {{at the hands of}} Lon Nol's anti-Communist forces. The <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> later imitated Lon Nol's actions.|$|E

50|$|The Royal University of Fine Arts (សាកលវិទ្យាល័យភូមិន្ទវិចិត្រសិល្បៈ) is a {{university}} in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Its origins date {{to the establishment of}} the École des arts cambodgiens in Phnom Penh in 1918.
