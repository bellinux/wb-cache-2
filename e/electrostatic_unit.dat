5000|$|The {{discovery}} {{of this relationship}} started in 1855, when Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch determined {{that there was a}} quantity related to electricity and magnetism, [...] "the ratio of the absolute electromagnetic unit of charge to the absolute <b>electrostatic</b> <b>unit</b> of charge" [...] (in modern language, the value [...] ), and determined that it should have units of velocity.

However, Weber and Kohlrausch did not make the connection to the speed of light. Towards the end of 1861 while working on part III of his paper On Physical Lines of Force, Maxwell travelled from Scotland to London and looked up Weber and Kohlrausch's results. He converted them into a format which was compatible with his own writings, and in doing so he established the connection to the speed of light and concluded that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{dimensional}} analysis have been disputed by historians. The 19th-century French mathematician Joseph Fourier is generally credited with having made important contributions {{based on the}} idea that physical laws like F = ma should be independent of the units employed to measure the physical variables. This led to the conclusion that meaningful laws must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was eventually formalized in the Buckingham π theorem. However, the first application of dimensional analysis has been credited to the Italian scholar François Daviet de Foncenex (1734-1799). It was published in 1761, 61 years before the publication of Fourier’s work.James Clerk Maxwell played a major role in establishing modern use of dimensional analysis by distinguishing mass, length, and time as fundamental units, while referring to other units as derived. Although Maxwell defined length, time and mass to be [...] "the three fundamental units", he also noted that gravitational mass can be derived from length and time by assuming a form of Newton's law of universal gravitation in which the gravitational constant G is taken as unity, thereby defining M = L3T−2. By assuming a form of Coulomb's law in which Coulomb's constant ke is taken as unity, Maxwell then determined that the dimensions of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>unit</b> of charge were Q = L3/2M1/2T−1, which, after substituting his M = L3T−2 equation for mass, results in charge having the same dimensions as mass, viz. Q = L3T−2.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 20th century, roentgens were used for the purpose of {{radiation}} protection. This replaced earlier practices that relied on time, film exposure, or fluorescence. The National Council on Radiation Protection established the first formal dose limit in 1931 as 0.1 roentgen per day. The International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee, now known as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) soon followed with a limit of 0.2 roentgen per day in 1934. In 1950, the ICRP reduced their recommended limit to 0.3 roentgen per week for whole-body exposure. The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) took over the definition of the roentgen in 1950, defining it as [...] "the quantity of X or γ-radiation such that the associated corpuscular emission per 0.001293 gram of air produces, in air, ions carrying 1 <b>electrostatic</b> <b>unit</b> of quantity of electricity of either sign." [...] The 3 MeV cap was no longer part of the definition, but the degraded usefulness of this unit at high beam energies was mentioned in the accompanying text. In the meantime, the new concept of roentgen equivalent man (rem) had been developed. Starting in 1957, the ICRP began to publish their recommendations in terms of rem, and the roentgen fell into disuse. The medical imaging community still has a need for ionization measurements, but they gradually converted to using C/kg as legacy equipment was replaced. The ICRU recommended redefining the roentgen to be exactly 2.58 × 10−4 C/kg in 1971.|$|E

Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|R

40|$|THE {{importance}} of the velocity {{of light in the}} development of electrical theory and practice is sometimes overlooked and in this review special emphasis will therefore be given to this aspect of the work and to the determinations of the velocity by electrical methods. It will moreover be assumed at the outset that in accordance with theory the value is independent of the frequency of the waves. The electrical, radio, and optical methods are all measurements of the same constant and the different titles of the various papers are merely indications of the particular technique employed. If there are discrepancies in the results then the theory must be re-examined; but so far no significant discrepancies have been found. The suggestion that light consists of an electromagnetic radia [...] tion was first made rather tentatively by Faraday in 1846, and ten years later Weber and Kohlrausch obtained a, value by an electrical method which was in good agreement with Fizeau's optical value. Faraday's suggestion, and this experimental support, were much in Maxwell's mind when he wrote his famous paper on the electromagnetio field. It may be regarded as an experimental faot which stimulated the formulation of electromagnetio theory rather than as a deduction made from it, as is often supposed.
