500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has been}} {{embroiled in a}} feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> That's how it goes to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E

2500|$|Returning {{to work in}} the studio, Loveless and Gordy re-recorded all the {{material}} they had worked on the previous autumn. The changed voice was stronger than what it was previously, and a different Patty Loveless recorded her first album for Epic, Only What I Feel.
