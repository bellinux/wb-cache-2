50|$|Diving watches have {{relatively}} thick watch crystals. Sometimes domed crystals {{are used to}} enhance the pressure-resistance of the watch and to improve the watch face legibility under water. The typical materials used for crystals are acrylic glass, <b>hardened</b> <b>glass</b> and synthetic sapphire which all have their pros and cons. Acrylic glass is very resistant to breakage; it can easily be scratched, but small scratches can be buffed out with polishing compounds. <b>Hardened</b> <b>glass</b> is more scratch-resistant than acrylic glass and less brittle than sapphire. Sapphire is very scratch-resistant but less shatterproof than the other options. Anti-reflective coatings are generally applied on sapphire crystals to enhance the legibility of the watch. Some manufacturers use sapphire/hardened glass laminate crystals, where the scratch-resistance of sapphire is combined with the better shatter-resistance of <b>hardened</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

So Belliveau bought a used vacuum chamber and directed employees to re-build it for the purpose of manufacturing their own dichroic filters. At the time, there were no other lighting companies that made their own dichroic filters. Color Pro was a commercial and critical success, selling multiple hundreds of units each month. It was distributed worldwide through a newly established distributor network.|$|E
50|$|Early {{windshields}} {{were made}} of ordinary window glass, but {{that could lead to}} serious injuries {{in the event of a}} crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal. The <b>hardened</b> <b>glass</b> shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, hovever, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, Henry Ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology of glass laminating. Windshields made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|On February 9, 1891, the New York Times {{reported}} on {{the founding of the}} company, which included seventeen factories. After the companies combined, two new plants were built. One, an automatic facility, was constructed at Gas City, Indiana. A hand-worked glass operation was also added at Tiffin, Ohio. The plants all received a letter designation. The main office started at South 9th and Bingham Streets, Pittsburgh, PA, in the former Ripley Glass facility, and moved to Tiffin in 1938. Over time, the factories closed until only the Tiffin plant survived. The company went bankrupt in 1963, with the Tiffin plant reorganizing as the [...] "Tiffin Art Glass Company". The other plant which survived to that point was the Glassport, Pennsylvania plant. It was closed after a storm on August 3, 1963 which resulted in the factory's water tower collapsing through the plant roof. The glass furnaces cooled and hardened, and it was not cost-effective to remove the 250 ton <b>hardened</b> <b>glass</b> and make the repairs that would have been needed to restart the facility.|$|E
40|$|Materials and {{structures}} technology covers {{a wide range}} of technical areas. Some of the most pertinent issues for the Astrotech 21 missions include dimensionally stable structural materials, advanced composites, dielectric coatings, optical metallic coatings for low scattered light applications, low scattered light surfaces, deployable and inflatable structures (including optical), support structures in 0 -g and 1 -g environments, cryogenic optics, optical blacks, contamination hardened surfaces, radiation <b>hardened</b> <b>glasses</b> and crystals, mono-metallic telescopes and instruments, and materials characterization. Some specific examples include low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) structures (0. 01 ppm/K), lightweight thermally stable mirror materials, thermally stable optical assemblies, high reliability/accuracy (1 micron) deployable structures, and characterization of nanometer level behavior of materials/structures for interferometry concepts. Large filled-aperture concepts will require materials with CTE's of 10 (exp 9) at 80 K, anti-contamination coatings, deployable and erectable structures, composite materials with CTE's less than 0. 01 ppm/K and thermal hysteresis, 0. 001 ppm/K. Gravitational detection systems such as LAGOS will require rigid/deployable structures, dimensionally stable components, lightweight materials with low conductivity, and high stability optics. The Materials and Structures panel addressed these issues and the relevance of the Astrotech 21 mission requirements by dividing materials {{and structures}} technology into five categories. These categories, the necessary development, and applicable mission/program development phasing are summarized.

50|$|The idea of {{heatable}} {{glass is}} based on usage of energy-efficient low-emissive glass, where the coating {{plays the role of}} heating element. It can be used both in production of multiple glass panes and as a part of triplex, which has also the function of protective glazing. The technological process of production of multiple glass panes made of heatable glass is practically the same as the process of ordinary multiple glass panes production. The main difference is the presence of power supply and, if necessary, temperature sensor. The temperature sensor allows to track the temperature of heating glass and eliminates the possibility of overheating of the product. In order to prevent shocks, the conductive coating is always placed inside the multiple glass pane or laminated unit. Only safe tempered glass, the strength of which is a lot higher than the strength of ordinary glass, is used in production of heatable glass. When the <b>hardened</b> <b>glass</b> is destroyed there are safe splittings. Also the current-carrying coating loses its integrity and the automatic fuse, which turns off the power supply of the glass, is activated. The electrodes are placed inside the lamination and no one can reach them without destruction of the product.|$|E

50|$|Soda-lime glass {{undergoes}} a steady increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature, permitting operations of steadily increasing precision. The glass is readily formable into objects {{when it has}} a viscosity of 104 poises, typically reached at a temperature around 900 °C. The glass is softened and undergoes steady deformation when viscosity is less than 108 poises, near 700 °C.

40|$|Four {{hand-held}} {{tools were}} tested for failed high-level waste melter decontamination and decommissioning (D&D). The forces {{felt by the}} tools during operation were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer since they will be operated by a remote manipulator. The efficiency of the tools was also recorded. Melter D&D consists of three parts: (1) glass fracturing: removing from the furnace the melted glass {{that can not be}} poured out through normal means, (2) glass cleaning: removing the thin layer of glass that has formed over the surface of the refractory material, and (3) K- 3 refractory breakup: removing the K- 3 refractory material. Surrogate glass, from a formula provided by the Savannah River Site, was melted in a furnace and poured into steel containers. K- 3 refractory material, the same material used in the Defense Waste Processing Facility, was utilized for the demonstrations. Four K- 3 blocks were heated at 1150 C for two weeks with a glass layer on top to simulate the <b>hardened</b> <b>glass</b> layer on the refractory surface in the melter. Tools chosen for the demonstrations were commonly used D&D tools, which have not been tested specifically for the different aspects of melter D&D. A jackhammer and a needle gun were tested for glass fracturing; a needle gun and a rotary grinder with a diamond face wheel (diamond grinder) were tested for glass cleaning; and a jackhammer, diamond grinder, and a circular saw with a diamond blade were tested for refractory breakup. The needle gun was not capable of removing or fracturing the surrogate glass. The diamond grinder only had a removal rate of 3. 0 x 10 - 4 kg/s for K- 3 refractory breakup and needed to be held firmly against the material. However, the diamond grinder was effective for glass cleaning, with a removal rate of 3. 9 cm 2 /s. The jackhammer was successful in fracturing glass and breaking up the K- 3 refractory block. The jackhammer had a glass-fracturing rate of 0. 40 kg/s. The jackhammer split the K- 3 refractory block into two pieces: one weighing 12. 7 kg and the other 16. 8 kg. However, it was not capable of fracturing smaller pieces off the block except when the chisel was applied {{at the edges of the}} block or at the fissure of the split. The circular saw successfully cut the K- 3 refractory material at a rate of 0. 29 cm 3 /s or a line at 4. 1 cm/s. A Fourier transform was performed on the acceleration data to obtain the frequency domain results...|$|E

There is a substantial energetic contribution to the stress that rises rapidly as segments between entanglements are pulled taut. The thermal component of stress is less sensitive to entanglements, mostly irreversible, and directly related to the rate of local plastic arrangements. Entangled and unentangled chains show the same strain hardening when plotted against the microscopic chain orientation rather than the macroscopic strain. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A drill {{processing}} for {{the difficult}} to cut material such as ceramics, <b>hardened</b> steel, <b>glass</b> and heat-resistant steel is widely requested {{in the industrial}} world. Furthermore the drilling process {{becomes more and more}} difficult in the case of that the requested hole diameter is less than one millimeter. In order to achieve requirements for drilling process, ultrasonically assisted machining is applicable. Ultrasonic vibration assisted machining techniques are suitable to machine difficult-to-cut materials precisely. The ultrasonic vibration assisted sub-millimeter drilling process reduces the cutting forces and prevents severe wear of tools. However, it is difficult to observe directly the effect of vibration action because the process of ultrasonic drilling is dynamic instantaneous and micro cutting process. In this report, high speed camera with appropriately arranged polarized device realized the visualization of process of ultrasonic drilling based on the photoelastic analysis. For the conventional drilling, the stress distribution diagram showed the intensive stress occurred under the chisel and side wall. On the other hand, the ultrasonic drilling produced lower and stable cutting force and decreased the tool temperature. 1...|$|R

This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. Float glass replaced this process.|$|R

40|$|The {{crystallization}} behaviour of {{a rapidly}} quenched, amorphous Al- 4 Ni- 6 Ce material has been examined during low temperature annealing, and shown to commence by the nucleation of nanoscale Al crystals, which stop growing once they reach a size of about 10 nm.

The nanoscale Al crystals lead to some <b>hardening</b> of the <b>glass,</b> but do not modify the good ductility of the material.

40|$|Solar energy {{generation}} gains in significance {{within the scope}} of a sustainable and environmentally oriented energy policy. An approach to efficiency increases of solar modules is to increase light transmission through the glass coverings by the use of anti reflection coatings. In the transmission of light through a grass screen because of the different refraction indexes at each boundary about 4 % of the light is reflected. By bringing to bear an anti reflection coating with a refractive index of 1. 23 {{on both sides of the}} glass an optimally stable reflection reduction is achieved over the entire spectral range of sunlight. Silica with a nano scale porosity of about 50 % is a material that fulfills these conditions. A wet chemical coating process was developed for nano coatings about 130 nm thick with porous structures. The coating is applied by the sol/gel process. After applying a nano-particulate silica sol by immersion coating a thermal treatment <b>hardens</b> the <b>glass.</b> Th e so obtained anti reflection coating leads to an increase in energy transmission of about 6 % and reduction of the angle dependence. With such an anti reflection covering glass the annual yield of a photovoltaic facility increases by 6 % and the annual heat yield of a collector facility increases by 10 %. The anti reflection glass has passed relevant stability tests and is used increasingly as standard glass for photovoltaic modules...|$|R

40|$|The {{metal fatigue}} {{mechanism}} of bulk glassy alloys (BGAs) {{resulting from the}} ductile nature of a glassy alloy {{differs from that of}} the conventional crystalline engineering alloys. Extreme hardening of the fatigue crack tip on the fatigue-fractured surface of the Zr- and Pd-based BGAs was usually observed just before the final fracture. Embrittlement around the fatigue crack tip, generated by excessive hardening to stop the fatigue crack propagation, significantly decreases fatigue fracture toughness. Hardening by hydrogen was also considered as an alternative mechanism of the strain aging effect in fatigue of glassy alloys because the second phase cannot be observed on a fatigue fracture surface, and only hydrogen promotes <b>hardening,</b> maintaining a <b>glass</b> structure. Hydrogen analysis of a micro area region was attempted with nuclear reaction analysis which used accelerated ion 15 N up to 6. 385 MeV to determine the hydrogen concentration of the fatigue-fracture surface.
