40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel statistical {{description of the}} counterpoise effective length due to lightning surges, where the (impulse) effective length had been obtained by means of regressive formulas applied to the transient simulation results. The effective length is {{described in terms of}} a statistical distribution function, from which median, mean, variance, and other parameters of interest could be readily obtained. The influence of lightning current amplitude, lightning <b>front</b> <b>duration,</b> and soil resistivity on the effective length has been accounted for, assuming statistical nature of these parameters. A method for determining the optimal counterpoise length, in terms of the statistical impulse effective length, is also presented. It is based on estimating the number of dangerous events associated with lightning strikes. Proposed statistical description and the associated method provide valuable information which could aid the design engineer in optimising physical lengths of counterpoises in different grounding arrangements and soil resistivity situations.

40|$|Purpose. To obtain {{experimentally}} {{that the}} duration of the high-voltage pulse front is less than 1. 5 nanoseconds on the load of a pulse voltage generator of less than 50 ohms in the form of more than two working chambers with a water-containing product. That increases the efficiency of disinfection of treated products. Methodology. To obtain high-voltage pulses in working chambers - the generator load - the pulse generation method was used according to the Arkadyev-Marx scheme. The pulses on the load were measured with a low-ohm resistive voltage divider, transmitted over a broadband coaxial cable, and recorded using a C 7 - 19 oscilloscope with a 5 GHz bandwidth. The working chambers were filled with water and consisted of an annular body made of PTFE 4 and metal electrodes forming the bottom and the chamber cover having flat linings of food stainless steel for contact with the food product inside the chamber. Results. The high-voltage pulses on the generator load of about 50 Ohm or less have a trapezoidal shape with a rounded apex and a base duration of no more than 80 ns. The experimentally obtained pulse amplitudes on the generator load are up to 18 kV. As the load resistance decreases, the amplitude of the pulses decreases, and {{the duration of}} the front and pulse duration in general are shortened because of the accelerated discharge of cascade capacitive storages. Originality. For the first time we have obtained experimentally on the load of the generator in the form of three parallel working chambers with water, the active resistance of each of which is less than 50 Ohm, the pulse <b>front</b> <b>duration</b> tf≈ 1 ns. In addition, we have obtained experimentally a stable 9 - 10 channel triggering mode of the trigatron type spark gap in a five-cascade pulse voltage generator with a step-by-step peaking (exacerbation) of the pulse front in its cascades (GPVCP). Practical value. We have obtained experimentally the nanosecond pulse <b>front</b> <b>duration</b> on the GPVCP load and that opens the prospect of industrial application of such generators for microbiologically disinfecting treatment (inactivation of microorganisms in food) water-containing food products...|$|E

40|$|Basing on 2 D {{computer}} simulation of physical processes in high-voltage reversibly-switched dynistors (RSD) important peculiarities of their submicrosecond pulse performance mechanisms have been studied. It is characteristic that on {{early stages of}} switching fronts rather great voltage spikes and dangerous delays in current rise are observed. These undesirable manifestations {{are found to be}} eliminated due to appropriate reduction of the doping in p-base. Following this way for RSD with blocking voltage of 2. 5 - 5 kV at the value of reversibly pumped charge 5 - 10 uC/cm^ 2 one can diminished the switching <b>front</b> <b>duration</b> up to 75 - 100 ns and lower.

40|$|Positive cloud-ground {{lightning}} {{is considerably}} {{more complex and}} less studied compared to the negative lightning. This paper aims to measure and characterize the significant parameters of positive return strokes electric field, namely, the zero-to-peak rise time, 10 - 90 % rise time, slow <b>front</b> <b>duration,</b> fast transition rise time (10 - 90 %), zero-crossing time, and opposite polarity overshoot relative to peak. To {{the best of the}} authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} such detailed characteristics of positive lightning in Malaysia are thoroughly analyzed. A total of 41 positive lightning flashes containing 48 return strokes were analyzed. The average multiplicity is 1. 2 strokes per flash. The majority of positive lightning was initiated from the primary positive charge rather than as a byproduct of in-cloud discharges. The cumulative probability distribution of rise time parameters, opposite polarity overshoot relative to peak, and slow front amplitude relative to peak are presented. A comparison between studies in four countries representing tropic, subtropic, and temperate regions was also carried out. Measured parameters in Florida, Sweden, and Japan are generally lower than those in Malaysia. Positive lightning occurrences in tropical regions should be further studied and analyzed to improve our current understanding on positive return strokes...|$|E
40|$|Disturbances of {{electric}} power {{transmission and distribution system}} are frequently caused by tow kinds of transient voltages whose amplitude may greatly exceed the peak values of normal A. C. voltage. The first kind is lightning over voltage, originated by lightning strokes hitting the phase wires of overhead lines or the busbar of outdoor stations. The amplitudes are very high, usually in the order of 1000 kv or more, depending upon the insulation. Exhaustive measurement and long experience have shown that lightning over voltages are characterized by short <b>front</b> <b>duration,</b> ranging from a fraction of micro second to several tens of microseconds and then slowly decreasing to zero. The second kind is caused by switching phenomena. Their amplitudes are always related to the operating voltage and the shape is influenced by the impedance of the system {{as well as by the}} switching condition. The rate of voltage rise is usually slower, but it is known that the wave shape can also be very dangerous to different insulation systems. Though the actual shape of both kinds of over voltages varies strongly, it became necessary to simulate these transient voltages by relatively simple means for testing purposes. Today the various national and international standards define the impulse voltage as a unidirectional voltage which rises rapidly to a peak value and then decays relatively slowly to zero. The impulse testing is necessary to ensure that the electrical equipment is capable of withstanding the over voltages that are met within service and to ensure a reliable service for system build by this tested equipment...|$|E
40|$|For a planar free {{electron}} laser (FEL) configuration we study self-amplified coherent spontaneous emission driven by a gradient of the bunch current {{in the presence of}} different levels of noise in bunches. The longitudinal granularity of the electron bunch density originating from shot noise is maintained throughout the analysis. For the FEL model with the SwissFEL injector bunch parameters, we calculate the probability density distribution of the maximum power of the radiation pulses for different levels of shot noise. It turns out that the temporal coherence quickly increases as the noise level reduces. We also show that the FEL based on coherent spontaneous emission produces almost Fourier transform limited pulses. The analysis indicates that the time-bandwidth product is mainly determined by the bunch length and the interaction distance in an undulator. Calculations of the FEL characteristics for different rise times of the front of the current pulse are performed, and it is found that a reduced level of the power fluctuations is preserved for the bunch current pulse with a <b>front</b> <b>duration</b> up to several FEL wavelengths. We also propose a novel scheme that permits the formation of electron bunches with a reduced level of noise and a high gradient of the current at the bunch tail to enhance coherent spontaneous emission. The presented scheme uses effects of noise reduction and controlled microbunching instability and consists of a laser heater, a bunch compressor, and a shot noise suppression section. We show that shot noise reduction by 2 orders of magnitude in electron bunches produced by the SwissFEL injector can be achieved in a compact noise suppression section. The noise factor and microbunching gain of the overall proposed scheme with and without laser heater are estimated...|$|E

40|$|Oscillographic {{measurement}} and time-resolved photographic recording {{have been used}} to examine the breakdown of rod/rod, rod/sphere and rod/plane gaps with long-duration negative impulse potentials of up to 1 MV crest. As in the positive discharge, the breakdown process is found often to cease for considerable periods on the impulse wave tail. Breakdown then occurs after a long time lag for gaps composed of rod cathodes and rod or small sphere anodes. Where the anode is large, no long time lags are observed. Measurement of the variation of breakdown strength with time during the impulse duration has been made by the superimposition of a second impulse upon the first, following a controllable delay. The results show a minimum probability of breakdown initiation after 15 μs of the applied impulse, and a subsequent slow recovery. It is suggested that this confirms the effect of the initial corona phase in causing space charge fouling of the gap. The breakdown voltage of rod/rod gaps is shown to decrease by up to 30 % when the impulse wave front is reduced from 0. 50 to 0. 06 μs. The breakdown strength with negative impulses is thus less than with positive impulses for wave fronts faster than 0. 20 μs. For the wave form 0. 50 / 2000 μs, the breakdown voltage is found to depend more critically upon the dimensions of the earthed electrode than is the case with positive impulses. The breakdown voltage for a rod/ 25 cm sphere gap is 73 % greater than for a rod/rod gap, yet also 15 % greater than for a rod/plane gap. For gap lengths between 25 and 65 cm, the breakdown voltage of the rod/plane gap is found to increase with decreasing wave <b>front</b> <b>duration.</b> The variation of the negative impulse corona with rate of potential rise and with crest voltage is examined photographically. Many of the observed variations of breakdown voltage and time-lag characteristics can be accounted for in terms of the impulse corona phase.
