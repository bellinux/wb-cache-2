The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E

However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century.

Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental <b>illnesses,</b> <b>and</b> predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E

40|$|Understanding <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> {{health care}} in the ancient world, and {{especially}} within ancient Israel, is not an easy undertaking. Most of the research done on Israelite health care focuses on the identification of disease rather than their sociological implications. This study hypothesises that to truly understand ancient Israel’s thoughts on <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> health care it is important to take the wider social context, in which a sick person would have found himself, into account. This study analyses the illness of King Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26 : 11 - 23) {{against the backdrop of the}} ancient Near East’s understanding of <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> health care, Israel’s view of Yahweh’s role in illness, as well as the interwovenness between <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> the social values of honour and shame. The notions of purity and impurity and the role they played in Israel’s understanding of illness, as well as the role of the temple and other consultative options are also taken into account in the study. In so doing the study intends to shed some light on the interwovenness between <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> social values in ancient Israel and thus enabling a better understanding of 2 Chronicles 26 : 11 - 23 <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> <b>and</b> {{health care in}} ancient Israel.

5|$|In 1983 Solti {{conducted}} for the only time at the Bayreuth Festival. By this stage in his career he no longer liked abstract productions of Wagner, or modernistic reinterpretations, such as Patrice Chéreau's 1976 Bayreuth Ring, which he found grew boring on repetition. Together with the director Sir Peter Hall and the designer William Dudley, he presented a Ring cycle that aimed to represent Wagner's intentions. The production was not well received by German critics, who expected radical reinterpretation of the operas. Solti's conducting was praised, but <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> last-minute replacements of leading performers affected the standard of singing. He was invited to return to Bayreuth for the following season, but was unwell and withdrew on medical advice before the 1984 festival began.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, HMV Group {{announced}} that Waterstones like-for-like sales over the Christmas period were down 8.5 per cent {{on the previous}} year. This culminated in the resignation of managing director Gerry Johnson with immediate effect. He was replaced by development director Dominic Myers, who was {{managing director of the}} British academic bookselling chain Blackwells until 2005. Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar's into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their local market alongside a 'rejuvenation' of the company brand and an increase in range. As part of these changes, Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> their families, in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations.

He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
5|$|Later {{texts of}} Hinduism declare Ahimsa {{one of the}} primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against dharma (moral life). Finally, the {{discussion}} in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain <b>illnesses,</b> <b>and</b> recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the Charaka Samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.|$|E

5|$|The 2/7th {{returned}} to Australia in early October 1943. After {{a period of}} leave, the battalion concentrated around Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands. During this time the units of the 6th Division were converted to the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} battalion's vehicle allocation and a reorganisation of its specialist platoons, with its Bren carriers and heavy vehicles being replaced by jeeps and the anti-aircraft platoon being disbanded. A medium machine gun platoon was added and new anti-tank weapons were also received. The battalion's authorised strength was also reduced to around 800 personnel; however, throughout late 1943 and into early 1944 the 2/7th was well below this due to <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> recurring diseases, such as malaria, amongst personnel who had returned from New Guinea. Nevertheless, a long period of training followed and the battalion was rebuilt over time and did not see further action until late in the war when the 6th Division was committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign, in order to release US troops for operations in the Philippines. At the start of the new campaign, Guinn was relieved of his command and appointed commandant of the Land Headquarters Tactical School. In his place, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Parbury took command of the battalion, which deployed aboard the US transport ship Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
