40|$|AbstractThe glucose {{metabolism}} of Fibrobacter succinogenes S 85 was studied in detail; key intermediates and alternative pathways <b>were</b> <b>evidenced</b> by NMR and/or enzymatic assays. A high phosphoketolase activity was detected in four strains of Fibrobacter under strictly anaerobic conditions, with ribose- 5 -phosphate as substrate, no activity <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> with fructose- 6 -phosphate. This {{is the first}} report of a pentose phosphates phosphoketolase in bacteria unable to use pentoses. In contrast, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway could not <b>be</b> <b>evidenced.</b> Incubation of living cells of F. succinogenes with Na 213 CO 3 confirmed the incorporation of 13 CO 2 in the carboxylic group of succinate. The presence of fumarase <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> by in vivo 13 C-NMR using 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO); the enzyme showed a high reversibility under physiological conditions. The production of formate from glucose catabolism <b>was</b> <b>evidenced</b> by enzymatic assay and by NMR and a pyruvate formate lyase activity was detected using strictly anaerobic conditions...|$|R

5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of groups}} of Jews venerating Ezra {{to an extent}} greater than {{mainstream}} Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group}} of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products.

Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E

The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as {{the capital of the}} Roman province of Britannia in 100.
