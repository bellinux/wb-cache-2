40|$|Background and Objectives: Linear alkyl benzene sulfonates {{are widely}} used as {{surfactants}} in formulated detergent products. Because of their use in household and <b>industrial</b> <b>detergents,</b> LAS is discharged into wastewater collection systems and subsequently entered to wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the concentration of LAS with accuracy. They are usually determined by standard method which is time-consuming,tedious and requires great quantities of chloroform. IN 2006 E. Jurado et al proposed a simplified method for measurement of LAS. In the present work the standard method and E. Jurado simplified method was compared economically. Material and Methods: In this work NPV method was used for accounting the cost of initial investment, consumable material, non-consumable equipment and annual cost of staff and finally Net Present Value was calculated for them separately. The rate of interest was considered 15 %. Results: calculation showed initial investment, annual cost of staff and materials for standard method 13351981, 499968 and 1710981 RLS, respectively.

40|$|A {{sample of}} palynomorph-rich Upper Carboniferous {{mudstone}} from Scotland was separately pre-treated overnight with acetone, two detergent solutions, formic acid, household bleach (two methods), methylated spirits and white spirit prior to palynological preparation using sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaPO 3) 6]. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify effective methods of pre-treatment that would increase palynomorph yields using the (NaPO 3) 6 method. Pre-treatment generally increased the mass of sample that was broken down by the (NaPO 3) 6 technique. Detergent one (carpet cleaner), formic acid, household bleach and white spirit allowed the disaggregation of more rock than without any pre-treatment. However, formic acid produced a lower concentration of Carboniferous miospores than with no pre-treatment. Pre-treatment with acetone, detergent two (<b>industrial</b> <b>detergent)</b> and methylated spirits actually decreased the weight of rock that was disaggregated with (NaPO 3) 6. Despite this, all these three pre-treatments improved the palynomorph yield as compared to with no pre-treatment. Moreover, all the pre-treatments except formic acid improved palynomorph productivity. The effectiveness of pre-treatments was demonstrated by the increased absolute numbers of indigenous palynomorphs extracted. However, the concentrations of miospores per gram of rock are more significant. Acetone, both detergent solutions, methylated spirit and white spirit significantly improved the amounts of palynomorph extracted.

40|$|Forward osmosis (FO) is an {{emerging}} technology {{which can be}} applied in water reuse applications. Osmosis is a natural process that involves less energy consumption than reverse osmosis (RO), and therefore can be applied as a dilution process before low-pressure RO; {{it is expected to}} compete favourably against current advanced water reuse technologies that use microfiltration/ultrafiltration and RO. The focus of this research was to assess the efficiency of different cleaning procedures to remove fouling from the surface of a FO membrane during the operation of a submerged system working in FO-mode (active layer (AL) facing feed solution) intended for secondary wastewater effluent (SWWE) recovery, using seawater as draw solution (DS), which will be diluted and can further be fed to a low-pressure RO unit to produce fresh water. Natural organic matter (NOM) fouling was expected to affect the AL, while for the support layer (SL), transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were used as indicators of fouling due to their stickiness and propensity to enhance the attachment of other foulants in seawater on the membrane surface. The composition of the NOM fouling layer was determined after proper characterisation with a liquid chromatograph coupled with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), showing biopolymers and protein-like substances as the main constituents. NOM fouling showed high hydraulic reversibility after a 25 % flux decline was observed, up to 89. 5 % when in situ air scouring for 15 min was used as a cleaning technique. Chemical cleaning with a mixture of Alconox, an <b>industrial</b> <b>detergent</b> containing phosphates, and sodium EDTA showed to increase the reversibility (93. 6 %). Osmotic backwash using a 4 % NaCl solution and DI water proved to be ineffective to recover flux due to the salt diffusion phenomena occurring at the AL. Part of the flux that could not be recovered is attributable to TEP fouling on the SL, which forms clusters clearly identifiable with an optical microscope and TEP-specific dyeing/staining of the membrane. Two solutions were tested to clean in place of the SL: a 1 % NaOCl solution and the same detergent solution used to clean the AL. The former agent compromised the integrity of the FO membrane, as proved with flux and conductivity measurements; 94. 5 % of flux was recovered with the latter agent, showing that chemically irreversible fouling for the FO membrane is on the order of 5. 5 %, which might be associated with the adsorption of biopolymers on the AL and some TEP residuals on the SL. Physical cleaning (air scouring) of the AL proved to be {{the most effective way to}} control fouling. © 2013 Copyright Balaban Desalination Publications...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} using {{natural fibres}} are studied intensively and {{widely used in}} applications including automotive, packaging, consumer goods and construction. Good balance of mechanical properties, processability and low cost are great advantages of these materials {{on top of the}} environmental benefits. Recently, there have been various efforts to amplify the positive effects on the environment by replacing the conventional polymers by bio-derived renewable polymers in the composites. Recent studies conducted from our research group showed competitiveness of plant fibre-thermoplastic composites. Implementing the promising results and experience, a new composite design using renewable polyethylene as the matrix material was studied. This polyethylene is a renewable thermoplastic that was derived from sugar cane ethanol. The objectives of this study were to employ renewable high density polyethylene (HDPE) into composites using wheat straw and flax fibre to extend the range of properties of the HDPE while keeping the amount of renewable content to nearly 100 %. The chemical resistance of these materials has not been reported before and it was investigated here by measuring and comparing the properties before and after accelerated chemical ageing. Both wheat straw and flax fibre had two different grades in size. Each of them was compounded with HDPE and additives (antioxidant and coupling agent) in a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The concentrations of fibres were varied from 0 to 30 wt-%. Then, injection molded samples were prepared for measurement of properties: tensile, flexural, impact tests. The effects of reinforcing fibre size were studied first. Both length and aspect ratio were considered. For both types of fibre composites, a general trend was observed. There was no clear evidence of improvements in flexural (strength and modulus) and tensile (strength, percentage elongation at break) properties with respect to the change in fibre size. However, impact (IZOD impact strength, Gardner impact failure energy) properties showed some improvements. This result was due to no substantial difference in size and aspect ratios in post-processed fibres that were actually residing in the matrix. There were remarkable improvements in flexural strength and modulus when the fibre content increased. However, minor decreases in tensile properties were observed. Furthermore, the impact properties were very sensitive to the concentration of fibres. As the fibre concentration went up, there were significant decreases in both IZOD impact strength and Gardner impact failure energy. Chemical resistance of these composites was studied by exposing them in six different chemical solutions (hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, ethyl alcohol, <b>industrial</b> <b>detergent,</b> water) for up to thirty days. The increase in weight and leaching behaviour was observed. As the fibre content increased within the composites, the weight gain was more rapid during chemical ageing. Because there were more fibres exposed on the surface after chemical ageing, it is likely that they contributed to the higher flux of liquids (used for chemical ageing) inside the sample. Among the physical properties, tensile properties were most susceptible to the chemical ageing. One possible reason could be due to the exposed surface area to volume ratio, which was the highest in tensile bars and therefore faster mass transfer taking place into the matrix per volume. Finally, morphological study using scanned electron spectroscopy (SEM) revealed the damage on the surface when exposed to the chemicals. The fibres on the surface had been leached out in the sodium hydroxide solution leaving empty spaces. The fractured surface was also monitored via SEM. Though there was not enough evidence of strong interfacial interactions between the fibre and the polymer, good dispersions were observed...|$|E

In the present study, bioaccumulation of 4 -NP was evaluated in the clam Tapes philippinarum after exposure for 7 and 14 days to 0, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 mg NP/L.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} composite osmotic distillation (OD) membrane consisting of a thin hydrogel coating on a microporous hydrophobic substrate for the concentration of aqueous feeds containing surface-active agents. The range of OD applications using the hydrophobic membrane alone have been severely limited by the propensity for membrane wet-out when contacted by amphiphilic agents such as oils, fats and detergents. Wet-out allows the feed solution to track freely through the membrane pores with a resulting loss of solutes {{and a decrease in}} selectivity. The rationale for the approach taken was based on the hypothesis that the high water selectivity of the hydrophilic coating would maintain good water mass transfer to the underlying hydrophobic substrate but exclude other components including surface-active agents. The first stage of this work involved the identification of potential coating materials and the fabrication and structural characterization of films of these materials to determine their suitability. The second stage involved the development of techniques to facilitate adhesion of the hydrophilic coatings to the hydrophobic substrate, and the testing of the resulting composite membranes for OD performance and resistance to wet-out by surface-active agents. Sodium alginate was selected as the major coating component {{on the basis of its}} non-toxicity and its potential for stable hydrogel formation. Structural characterization of noncrosslinked films and films crosslinked using a water-soluble carbodiimide (WSC) was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and swelling measurements. Maximum crosslinking through esterification of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on adjacent polymer strands using the film immersion method was achieved with a non-solvent (ethanol) concentration of 60 vol % and a WSC concentration of 100 mM at pH 4. These conditions resulted in a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 60 wt %. DSC measurements of noncrosslinked and crosslinked alginate films showed an increase in crystallinity and hence rigidity on crosslinking. Therefore, several coatings were prepared as blends of sodium alginate and amorphous highly flexible carrageenan gum in order to meet the flexibility requirements of a membrane subjected to varying operating pressures in an industrial OD plant. Structural characterization with respect to polymer blend ratio was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimisation for crosslinking conditions was undertaken as for sodium alginate alone. Optimum conditions for film preparation were 20 wt % carrageenan content and a crosslinking medium containing 60 vol % non-solvent (ethanol) and 120 mM WSC at pH 4. These conditions produced a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 85 wt %. Two different techniques were employed to anchor the coatings on substrate PTFE membranes. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 2 µm, the technique involved surface tension adjustment of the coating solution by ethanol addition in order to enhance penetration of the coating solution meniscus into the substrate pores. This was followed by polymer precipitation by the selective removal of water using OD to provide structural interlocking. T-peel strength measurements showed that this technique resulted in a ten-fold increase in adhesion strength when compared with a coating cast without surface tension adjustments. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 1 µm, an interfacial bonding agent, myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTMA), was used. This technique gave a three-fold increase in adhesion strength relative to that of coating cast without the use of MTMA. The composite membranes were tested in extended OD trials using pure water and feeds containing limonene, the major surface-active components of orange oil. The sodium alginate-carrageenan blend membrane, which was the preferred membrane based on flexibility and water sorption considerations, was also tested against full-cream milk and an <b>industrial</b> <b>detergent,</b> sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS). The results indicated that the coatings offered little resistance to water transport and were effective in providing protection against membrane wet-out. Durability trials showed that the composite membranes retained their integrity in water for a minimum of 30 days. Overall, this study has expanded the potential applications of OD to include many important industrial concentration steps that are currently being undertaken by conventional processes with unsatisfactory results. These include the concentration of citrus juices, full-cream milk and nuclear power plant liquid waste. These feeds contain limonene, fats and detergents respectively, all of which wet out unprotected hydrophobic membranes...|$|E
40|$|Since {{more than}} 97 % {{of the water}} in the world is seawater, {{desalination}} technologies have the potential to solve the fresh water crisis. The most used desalination technology nowadays is seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO), where a membrane is used as a physical barrier to separate the salts from the water, using high hydraulic pressure as the driving force. However, the use of high hydraulic pressure imposes a high cost on operation of these systems, in addition to the known persistent fouling problems associated with reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration systems. Forward osmosis (FO) is an alternative membrane process that uses an osmotic pressure difference as the driving force. FO uses a concentrated draw solution to generate high osmotic pressure, which extracts water across a semi-permeable membrane from a feed solution. Afterwards, fresh water can be obtained when the diluted draw solution is regenerated in a second treatment step, e. g., low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO). Research has identified the potential for hybrid forward osmosis/low-pressure reverse osmosis (FO/LPRO) systems for several applications, including seawater desalination, and to reduce the cost and fouling propensity of producing fresh water from impaired-quality water sources, compared to conventional high pressure RO systems. One of the main advantages of FO is the limited amount of external energy required to extract water from the feed solution, using only a very low amount of energy to recirculate the draw solution {{on one side of the}} membrane, while the feed solution is passively in contact with the other side of the membrane. The objective of this research is the evaluation of a hybrid desalination system using forward osmosis, where the feed water is a primary or a secondary wastewater effluent, and the draw solution is seawater, with the purpose of recovering fresh water from impaired quality sources with the use of minimum hydraulic pressure. This hybrid system has two clear advantages: (i) the diluted seawater resulting from the FO dilution process is further treated in a LPRO unit to produce fresh water, using less energy than conventional high pressure SWRO systems; (ii) the concentrated wastewater effluent produced by FO enables low-cost processing. The results show that forward osmosis recovers water from wastewater, rejects nutrients and micropollutants, outperforms traditional SWRO systems in terms of fouling resistance and control, having a high flux recovery when applying physical cleaning methods. Water recovery A study revealed the ability of a FO process to integrate seawater desalination and municipal wastewater treatment for drinking water production (Chapter 2). The FO process showed a high rejection for chemical oxygen demand, phosphate and trace metals, and moderate rejection for ammonia and total nitrogen. Organic carbon analysis revealed that the membrane tested was unable to reject low molecular weight acids and low molecular weight neutral compounds, such as sodium acetate and urea. Biopolymer-like substances played a dominant role in the formation of fouling on the membrane surface. The study showed that FO is a reliable barrier to effectively reject most wastewater contaminants and salts from either the wastewater as feed solution or seawater as draw solution while allowing clean water to pass through, providing a possible significant energy-saving strategy to combine (integrate) municipal wastewater treatment and seawater desalination to further promote sustainable urban water management and water reuse in coastal cities. Furthermore, in another study (Chapter 3), applying practical conditions of water reuse applications, FO membranes were able to reject most of the organic micropollutants spiked in the feed water; rejections were moderate for hydrophilic neutral compounds (44 – 95 %), moderate for hydrophobic neutral contaminants (48 – 92 %), and high for the hydrophilic ionic micropollutants (96 – 99 %). FO coupled with LPRO was effective in rejecting low molecular weight hydrophilic neutral micropollutants, with rejections exceeding 89 %. For the rest of the compounds, rejections were greater than 99 %. A hybrid FO/LPRO system serves as a double barrier against micropollutants, including pharmaceutically active compounds, hormones and other pollutants. Organic fouling and cleaning Characterization of the organic foulants in both wastewater and seawater was performed (Chapter 4). Organic carbon analysis (liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrices (3 -D FEEM)) suggest that biopolymers and protein-like substances, present in the feed water, form a fouling layer on feed side of the FO membrane, reducing the water flux and thus, affecting the efficiency of the seawater dilution process. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were identified in the support layer of the FO membrane in contact with the seawater, which contains a significant amount of these particles, reducing the flux of the FO membrane. Physical and chemical methods were used and compared in an effort to set an effective protocol for FO membrane cleaning (Chapter 5). Natural organic matter fouling showed high hydraulic reversibility, up to 90 % when in-situ air scouring for 15 minutes was used as a cleaning technique. Chemical cleaning with a mixture of Alconox, an <b>industrial</b> <b>detergent</b> containing phosphates, and sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) showed to improve the reversibility further (93. 6 %). Osmotic backwashing using a 4 % NaCl solution and deionized (DI) water proved to be ineffective to recover the flux due to the salt diffusion phenomena occurring at the active layer (the membrane separation layer). The same detergent solution used to clean the active layer was used to clean the support layer; 95 % of flux was recovered, showing that the chemically irreversible fouling of the FO membrane is in the order of 5. 5 %, which might be associated with the adsorption of biopolymers on the active layer and some TEP residuals on the support layer. Physical cleaning (air scouring) proved to be the most effective way to control organic fouling. Biofouling The study on the influence of feed spacer thickness (28, 31 and 46 mil, 1 mil = 0. 0254 mm) on performance and biofouling development on the feed side of FO membranes (Chapter 6) led to the following conclusions: (i) the biomass amount alone does not determine the flux decline: the same amount of biomass was found for all spacer thicknesses after the same run time at the same feed flow, while the flux reduction decreased with thicker spacer; (ii) the flux decline caused by biomass accumulation can be reduced by using a thicker spacer; (iii) spatial distribution of the biofilm differed with feed spacer thickness. Findings are in agreement with reported data for high pressure reverse osmosis cross-flow systems: thicker spacers reduce the impact of biofouling on performance. This result clearly contradicts observations obtained with particulate and colloidal fouling in forward osmosis. Outlook Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging membrane technology with a range of possible water treatment applications (desalination and wastewater recovery). An overview of applications, advantages, challenges, costs and knowledge gaps is given (Chapter 7). With current commercial technology, hybrid FO systems for both desalination and water recovery applications have proven to have higher capital cost compared to conventional technologies. Nevertheless, due to the demonstrated lower operational costs of hybrid FO systems, the unit cost for each m 3 of fresh water produced with the FO system are lower than conventional desalination/water recovery technologies (i. e. ultrafiltration/RO systems). There are key benefits of using FO hybrid systems compared to RO: (i) chemical storage and feed systems may be reduced for capital, operational and maintenance cost savings, (ii) reduced process piping costs, (iii) more flexible treatment units, and (iv) higher overall sustainability of the desalination process, while producing high quality water. The major challenges of FO to be a commercially viable technology are: (i) developing a higher flux membrane, capable of maintaining an elevated salt rejection and a reduced internal concentration polarization (ICP) effect, (ii) the availability of appropriate draw solutions, which can be recirculated via an efficient recovery process, (iii) better understanding of fouling and biofouling occurrence, (iv) assuring the high quality of the water produced, (v) hybridization with other technologies that can increase the benefits of FO use (i. e. water recovery, energy production, etc.). Numerical modeling can be a useful tool to understand biofouling in FO membrane processes and to suggest potential approaches for fouling prevention/reduction. Along with this, future experimental studies should focus on the use of modified spacers and novel cleaning strategies. It is strongly suggested to upscale the process into a pilot scale facility in which a comprehensive evaluation of water quality and energy parameters can be done, facilitating a life cycle assessment and a cost cycle assessment of a hybrid process (i. e. FO-LPRO), which will give important information on the direction that should be taken to develop robust low cost water treatment hybrid systems to produce high quality water.

The capability of NP to induce apoptotic events in haemocytes was also studied. Exposure of clams to 0. 2 mg/l NP increased significantly (P< 0. 05) Neutral Red uptake when compared with controls, suggesting that NP may cause alterations in cell membrane stability. Significant (P< 0. 01) decreases with respect to controls in both SOD and lysozyme activities were observed at concentration higher than 0. 05 mg /l NP. A significant (P< 0. 001) increase in apoptotic index (i. e., the percentage of haemocytes showing positivity to the TUNEL reaction) was also recorded in the same 54 concentration range. Apoptotic haemocytes generally showed a shrinkage of cell volume and a spherical shape.

40|$|Nonylphenol (NP) {{is widely}} used in {{nonionic}} surfactant formulation, especially in producing nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs). NPEs are commonly employed in plastics, latex paints, lubricating oils, emulsifi ers, pesticides, paper and textile industries, and both household and <b>industrial</b> <b>detergents.</b> As a consequence of their wide use, high levels of NPEs are discharged in the aquatic environment, either directly from untreated effl uents or indirectly from sewage treatment plants, where they are biologically degraded to de-ethoxylated intermediates, of which NP is the fi nal product. In water, NP is more persistent than NPEs; moreover, because of its high lipophilicity NP can rapidly be accumulated by aquatic organisms, especially by bivalve molluscs. In the present study, we evaluated lethal and sublethal effects of NP on the clam Tapes philippinarum, ecologically and commercially important in the lagoon of Venice. In 96 hour lethality test, animals were exposed to 0, 0 plus acetone, 0. 19, 0. 38, 0. 75, 1. 5, 3 mg NP l- 1. The 96 -h LC 50 was 1. 12 mg l- 1. To evaluate alterations of physiological responses (fi ltration rate, respiration rate, scope for growth and survival in air) clams were exposed to various sublethal NP concentrations (0, 0 plus acetone, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2 mg NP l- 1) for seven days. Adverse effects of NP were observed on physiological parameters of clams. Filtration rate signifi cantly decreased at 0. 1 and 0. 2 mg NP l- 1 (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01, respectively).
