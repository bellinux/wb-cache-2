5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> politics, religion and science, and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> science.|$|E

5|$|As {{an expert}} in the use of air units to aid {{artillery}} and infantry, Gordon P. Saville held to the concept of tactical air power through his time as ACTS instructor from 1934 to 1936. Later, Saville successfully implemented his <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean Theater.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> the first chapter on variation of On the Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{linked the}} nature of prime {{distribution}} with <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> analysis. He proved that {{the sum of the}} reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and the prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.|$|E

5|$|Having {{refused to}} publish her <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> books, Montalban became largely {{forgotten}} following her death, although the OMS continued under new leadership. Her {{life and work}} was mentioned in various occult texts and historical studies of esotericism during subsequent decades; a short biography by Julia Philips was published by the Atlantis Bookshop in 2012.|$|E
5|$|His serious remarks {{could get}} him in trouble as well. Some of his public utterances in 1913, in which he {{appeared}} to advocate radical <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> regard to the inheritance of property, caused much criticism.|$|E
5|$|Hume often wrote editorials, {{engaged in}} litigation, appealed to legislators, and waged {{political}} campaigns {{to protect his}} business interests. Running as a Republican, he was twice elected, in 1900 and 1902, to represent Coos and Curry counties in the Oregon House of Representatives. According to his biographer, he voted self-interest first and conservative positions second, resisting Populist <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> vogue at the time.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major <b>ideas,</b> <b>in</b> large part because {{it has not been}} cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.|$|E
5|$|One of Euler's {{more unusual}} {{interests}} was {{the application of}} mathematical <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} third edition, Darwin prefaced the {{introduction}} with a sketch of {{the historical development of}} evolutionary <b>ideas.</b> <b>In</b> that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.|$|E

5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> the Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the {{group known as}} the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's Transcendental idealism, {{as well as his}} celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.|$|E

5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{draws upon}} many poems, {{including}} ideas from William Cowper's Task.
