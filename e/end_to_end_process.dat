Commonly referred to as ‘National VMS reporting’, it uses both satellite and GPRS/GSM communication services depending on the Legislative requirements. Two schemes are currently operational: for Northern Ireland Mussel Dredging and Isle of Man Scallop Fisheries. EU VMS reporting scheme: these are fishing vessel position reporting requirements, through satellite communication services only, that enables the authorities to track the position of fishing vessels, as set out in EU Regulations. It is commonly referred to as ‘EU VMS reporting’.In addition, electronic logbook requirements are defined thus: catch and effort recording in ‘real time’ but as a minimum every 24hrs whilst a fishing vessel is at sea. Catch and effort data can be transmitted over whichever communication channel is available (i.e., if the Satellite Communication Service is unavailable, connection will be attempted via GPRS/GSM and vice versa). Electronic logbooks are commonly referred to as ‘E-logbooks’ and the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> and accompanying software is referred to as ‘Elogbook Software System or ELSS’.In order to address this challenge the UK fishing authorities teamed up with Applied Satellite Technology Ltd (AST Ltd) in 2012 {{to come up with a}} combined solution. The resulting solution was the VMS Plus device, which has the capability to deliver all of these requirements through one device and is now being rolled out to the UK fishing fleet. In summary the VMS Plus device meets the following functional requirements in full: ...|$|E

This project was led by the Civil and Industrial Engineering department (Aerospace Unit) of Pisa University and co-funded by the Regional Government of Tuscany. The project was executed by Edi Progetti & Sviluppo and completed in August 2013 {{with the construction of}} a full-scale prototype of IDINTOS. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish an initial draft manual (Pilot’s Operating Handbook, POH) based on the IDINTOS research activities compliant with standard regulations for future use in certification applications. This encompassed observing, actively participating and documenting the manufacturing and assembly <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> during all phases of the IDINTOS project.

40|$|In a {{traditional}} multitier applications performance bottlenecks {{can be in}} user interactions level or network latency or data access or business logic level. The solutions as changes or tuning parameters can be applied at architect, design, framework or algorithm or at coding level. This paper highlights an inquisitive, experimental, top down, tear apart, drill down and analytical approach across two aspects one across <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> flow and data flow on those specific use cases or scenarios requiring performance improvement and another across layers of abstraction like architecture, framework, design, logic and coding. Re engineering for performance gain requires identifying hot spots on both aspects viz which architectural, design decision or which processing or data flow stage is having performance issue. Once identified one can further drill down and identify root cause and also can find solution as a change. To help the application owner in decision making process, the analysis outcome should have tuning parameters, relationship between them, optimum values, tradeoffs on each changes, effort, risks, cost and benefits for incorporating each change. Following the above mentioned approach on a system in production with large enterprise we could drill down to a rectangular hyperbolic or reciprocal relation between elapsed time to transport all records retrieved from a query {{and the number of}} records being pre fetched (pre fetch size) and cached in the data base client application by the database driver in each trip. Because of the reciprocal nature, we could observe that when the pre fetch size is low drastic reduction in elapsed time could be obtained even for a small increase in pre fetch size, whereas when the pre fetch size is high the gain in performance is not so significantly high even for larger increase in pre fetch size...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The United Nations (UN) Property Management Unit (PMU) {{under the}} Logistics Support Division (LSD) of the Department of Field Support (DFS), in exercising {{effective}} stewardship over United Nations Owned Equipment (UNOE), sought {{to develop a}} Property Management Performance Management Framework. The present research was written to assess the current performance of the Property Management Performance Management Framework (PMPMF) and suggest further improvements. The scope of the PMPMF was also envisioned to be expanded to include other services with emphasis on the overall <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>processes</b> of DFS/UN supply chain. Design/Methodology/Approach: Both qualitative and quantitative based approaches were adopted in this study. Several Academic literatures were reviewed to develop a robust performance management framework, TOTS Canvas. KPI categorization under the TOTS Canvas includes: Technological, Operational, Tactical and Strategic (TOTS). Findings: The research provides a novel framework for measuring the overall <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>processes</b> within organizations with special emphasis on supply chain. The research results showed, that 91. 2 % of the users of the framework agree that the PMPMF has helped their missions to exercise good stewardship over UN assets. Consequently some benchmarking KPIs were identified and deemed as very significant to PMU/LSD/DFS/UNHQ end-to-end Supply Chain. These KPIs were categorized under eight sub-groupings. Other services under LSD were also identified {{to be included in}} the expansion of the current PMPMF. Research Limitations/Implications: Future studies can be conducted to validate the TOTS Canvas in different organizational settings. The envisioned <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>processes</b> of the United Nations supply chain is still ongoing, certain Organizational principles might not be applicable in the near future so it will be vital to conduct further researches to validate the results and findings of this present research. Practical Implications: The thesis provides robust practical contribution applicable to mainstream supply chain performance management initiatives. This is achievable by applying the TOTS Canvas offered in this research. Practitioners and researchers who seek <b>to</b> identify an extensive <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> performance management involving several downstream and upstream processes can apply the TOTS Canvas Originality/Value: To the candid knowledge of the researcher, the categorizations of KPIs have not been done in a way reflecting the TOTS Canvas.

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry is constantly evolving, which {{has resulted in}} a growing number of services for end-users. The current trend of triple- and quadruple-play offers that include services using different technologies have caused the IT support for the IT service providers to become increasingly complex. This diploma paper deals with the order management system (OMS) whose purpose is to support order entry and order handling as an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process.</b> In order to achieve the greatest possible degree of business process automation, OMS performs integrations with numerous other systems that are responsible for other domains. Due to the complexity of IT in modern telecommunications companies, the fragmentation of IT into specific domains is required, but this makes the data management within an organization much more difficult. Therefore, the TM Forum has developed frameworks for the organization of IT and recommendations on how business processes should be defined and how enterprise information model should be implemented. In its first part, this thesis presents the technologies that are required for the successful implementation of the order management system in telecommunications. First, the TM Forum's Frameworx is described, followed by SOAP web services. The business process modeling systems basics are introduced, since these are required for the implementation of the order handling business process. The third chapter is devoted to the SID framework analysis, a Frameworx component that deals with shared information and data model. It focuses mostly on product and service domains, since these are the most important from the order handling perspective. The main part of the thesis then presents the OMS, its architecture and a rich history of optimizations of the system {{in the last two years}} since its initial production deployment. The main systems that OMS is integrated with are presented as well. Finally, the implementation of the OMS data model is presented. The chapter also explains how data obtained from the product catalog and service management system is being paired in the OMS. ...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With the rise in computational power, the prospect of simulating a complex engineering system {{with a high degree}} of accuracy and in a meaningful way is becoming a real possibility. Modelling and simulation have become ubiquitous throughout the engineering life cycle, as a consequence there are many thousands of existing models and simulations that are potential candidates for integration. This work is concerned with ascertaining if systems engineering principles are of use in the support of virtual testing, from desire to test, designing experiments, specifying simulations, selecting models and simulations, integrating component parts, verifying that the work is as specified, and validating that any outcomes are meaningful. A novel representation of systems engineering framework is proposed and forms the bases for the methods that were developed. It takes the core systems engineering principles and expresses them in a way that can be implemented in a variety of ways. An <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> for virtual testing with the potential to use existing models and simulations is proposed, it provides structure and order to the testing task. A key part of the proposed process is the recognition that models and simulations requirements are different from those of the system being designed, and hence a modelling and simulation specific writing guide is produced. The automation of any engineering task has the potential to reduce the time to market of the final product, for this reason the potential of natural language processing technology to hasten the proposed processes was investigated. Two case studies were selected to test and demonstrate the potential of the novel approach, the first being an investigation into material selection for a squash ball, and the second being automotive in nature concerned with combining steering and braking systems. The processes and methods indicated their potential value, especially in the automotive case study where inconsistences were identified that could have otherwise affected the successful integration. This capability, combined with the verification stages, improves the confidence of any model and simulation integration. The NLP proof of concept software also demonstrated that such technology has value in the automation of integration. With further testing and development there is the possibility to create a software package to guide engineers through the difficult task of virtual testing. Such a tool would have the potential to drastically reduce the time to market of complex products...|$|E

The model was one of partnership - between public sector Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and the commercially-driven UKeU, and between collaborating HEIs. It was judged unsuccessful by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) who wound up the venture in 2004. This symposium will ask the question "Where now for global e-learning?" The panel members will draw both on practical experiences of working on UKeU projects and on the work undertaken by the e-Learning Research Centre which is a joint venture between the Higher Education Academy and the Universities of Manchester and Southampton. The outcomes from three studies will be presented, each examining a different aspect of UKeU. 1) eLearning in UKeU: Through questionnaires and in-depth interview eLRC has examined the approach taken by UKeU to e-learning {{and the extent to which}} the model advocated was taken up and applied by the course development teams in HEIs. Is the activity-based learning object model developed by UKeU worth adopting? What other models make sense for global HE courses? 2) Managing risks: One of the impediments to e-learning is the perception of the different nature of risk compared to conventional teaching and learner support. UKeU recognised this and implemented a risk register that was revised and reviewed every quarter. Examination of some of the UKeU risk registers by the eLRC has revealed the scope of risks and their severity and impact as identified by UKeU. The contribution to overall risk levels from the business model, the marketing operation and the technology adopted will all be examined. Are there lessons to be learnt from UKeU for others involved in high risk activities? What can be done to manage, and where possible, eliminate risks of the sort encountered by UKeU? 3) Modelling UKeU: The eLRC is developing a UML model of the UKeU end to end business process. It is anticipated that this, and similar models, will be applicable to e-learning in other organisations. How helpful are models such as this in managing the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> of e-learning effectively? Is it realistic to try to industrialise the development process and the delivery of courses? How ready are HEIs to take this road? What are the human issues around such approaches that might impede their effectiveness? HEFCE's e-learning strategy now favours "blended learning" over "pure" e-learning. Does this mean that supporting students via e-learning to take courses entirely remotely should not be attempted? The symposium will use the evidence from the UKeU studies to inform the debate of what constitutes good practice in global e-learning. It will explore just how relevant e-learning could be to addressing the global deficit for higher education and examine the extent to which the perception of international students as cash cows runs counter to universities' belief in education as a tool for promoting equity...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a common issue for the business organizations of the world. It has become an important factor for the companies to do something good for the well being of the societies or surroundings where they belong to. Gradually many factors like supply chain sustainability as well as managing risk, adding value and benefit for stakeholder groups are coming forward concerning with CSR. A banking supply chain includes both the supply side and demand side elements that involves the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> of sourcing funds, managing those funds, disbursement of funds to, and collection from, customers. These activities can be conducted directly by the bank or indirectly through its intermediaries or agents. Like all other organizations banks also face cost and other challenges: some are predictable and some unanticipated. So Banks need to develop some strategies to navigate these challenges, like identifies hidden business costs, enhance its’ cash supply chain capabilities and improve productivity by uncovering organization’s insights that create opportunities for cost reduction, improving efficiency and mitigating risks–all without diminishing value. By thinking of cash as goods, banks can apply proven consumer business (CB) strategies to reduce excess inventory, lower handling and processing costs, improve operating efficiency and optimize the supply chain network of ATMs. Financial institutions, such as banks, do not produce hazardous chemicals or discharge toxic pollutants into the air, land or water and thus apparently they might be viewed as uninvolved with environmental issues. But through their financing practices they are supporting commercial activity that ultimately degrades the natural environment. Again CSR is not just philanthropy and obeying the laws, rather an attempt to ensure their own sustainability and profitability. In Bangladesh The banking sector {{has a history of}} involvement in benevolent activities like donate to different charitable organizations, poor people and religious institutions, city beautification and patronize art & culture. In this study twenty two private commercial banks have been chosen to find out the relationship between CSR & deposit amount, CSR & loan amount by evaluating last four years data. The study has given an interesting output. The output has shown that the relationship between CSR & deposits fits only 12 % where the relationship between CSR & loans fits only 8 %. So, {{it can be said that}} there is positive relationship between CSR & deposits, CSR & loans but the relationships are not strong enough. Brand trust is another important factor which can be affected by CSR expenses. In case of measuring brand trust, six phases of CSR- Employee Satisfaction, Social Phase, Ethical State, Legal Phase, Economic phase, Brand Trust and Environmental Phase has been used. If the CSR activities have been done properly then there are positive impacts on these six phases. To measure & compare the relationship between the brand trust & CSR expenses four banks has been chosen. Thirty employees from each bank (total 120) have been chosen randomly to find out their brand trust through questionnaire survey. From the comparison among four banks having the highest & lowest CSR expense in 2013, we can see that in every aspect or phases of CSR DBBL & IBBL have significant value than BCBL & NCCBL. In 2013 DBBL & IBBL have spent the highest amount in CSR where BCBL & NCCBL has spent the lowest. From the study we can see that in every phase there is a strong link between CSR expenses & brand trust or brand reputation. So, it is very much clear that CSR has a great impact on brand trust as well as brand value as the customers and employees believe the brand for its social responsibility nature. So from the study it can be said that as a tool of procurement and supply chain management CSR is quite efficient & successful in creating brand trust and reputation than increasing the amounts of deposits & loans. Though the relationships between CSR expense & deposits, CSR expense & loans are not strong enough but by creating the brand trust the banks can bring an overall positive impact on the banks performance. So, the CSR activities should be used in a very much effective way with other important factors so that in near future CSR can have a significant impact on the overall supply chain of a bank in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|FMS: The {{rapid growth}} in New Zealand’s {{telecommunications}} industries allowed growth of supportive industries like Information Technology (IT) development companies. This case study is about a small IT company called Field Management Services (FMS) and their struggle in the current economic market. New Zealand’s telecommunications industry is regulated {{by the government and}} due to economic benefits of the internet the government invested $ 5 billion in its growth and made changes to promote competition in the market. This allowed FMS to grow along with the market. FMS launched in 2003 and doubled in size every 2 - 3 years until 2013 when the market became unstable due to the government conducting a price review of regulated products. This stopped the Retail Service Providers (RSP’s) like 2 degrees, Telecom and Vodafone from spending what they usually do with FMS for software and hardware services. FMS needed to be more careful with how they spend their capital expenditure, they needed {{to make sure it was}} being spent on the right IT initiatives to produce a certain level of benefits for the organisation. Key products for FMS are software applications development specifically for the telecommunications network and data centre management offering cloud solutions. The FMS organisational structure has a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and four key executives that also sit on the Capital Control Council (CCC). The IT department sits under the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who also manages the Project Management Office (PMO) which runs all the IT project initiatives. The current issue facing FMS is the CIO cannot justify the current capital expenditure of his IT department. There does not seem to be an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>process</b> for benefit realisation. Everyone in the IT department agreed that the benefits are never measured. The benefits appear in the business case presented to the CCC but they are not tracked and even if they were most times projects cancelled out each other’s benefits. The CIO conducted research to find out if there was a business benefit realisation process and if it could be improved upon. With business on the decline FMS needed to become more efficient. Literature: The academic literature identified the lack of a business benefit programme as an issue in the IT sector. There have been advances in project management to track the time, scope and cost of IT projects but 30 - 40 % of IS projects are still delivering no benefits at all (Bradley, 2010). Very few organisations engage benefit identification early enough and they also do not track the benefits through to completion, which could be 6 months to 2 years down the track. The literature also recommends what an organisation can adopt to increase the benefit realisation in their organisation. Fink (2003), suggests identifying and tracking tangible and non tangible benefits which are financial and non financial. Using a tracking register that regularly reports up to an executive level is beneficial, along with a clear plan of what, who and how it will be measured. The Stakeholder Identification Theory will be applied to the current validated benefit process at FMS to identify weaknesses and assist in making those weaknesses stronger. The theory analyses each stakeholder and assigns them a ranking. If the ranking is low it is a weakness in the process and recommendations will be made on how to increase the ranking of the weak stakeholders. Analysis: The method of research consists of qualitative research in the form of conversational style interviews. Some preliminary investigation produced a draft benefit realisation process that would be used as a hypothesis for the interviewees to validate and comment on. Validation of the process diagram showed: 1. No official process for benefit realisation, 2. Business Technology Manager (BTM) was missing, 3. No feedback loop to the CCC, 4. Only two people in the whole organisation knew about a benefit tracking register, 5. PMO successfully using the 3 ‘O’ model to outline benefits at the initiate gate phase, 6. Specialist Material Expert (SME) needed to be added. There were six trends that came out of the interview questions that gave deeper insight to the weaknesses in the benefit process for FMS: 1. CCC is only about funding and the report to executive committee on benefits is too highlevel. 2. Capital Performance Manager (CPM) has tracking register but is only tracking financial benefits from business cases. 3. BTM acts as Business Owner (BO) as well as a BTM on some projects, is the BTM appropriate to act in all the BO roles. 4. Benefits in business case are too vague and only financial (tangible) benefits officially reviewed. 5. BO is part-time and has disbanded so no one is responsible for measuring benefits. 6. Benefits in business case not always reviewed when scope of funding changes to the project. With these issues in mind the case study then applies the Stakeholder Identification Theory to the categorised stakeholders in the FMS benefit process and assigns a ranking number. Three stakeholders stood out with low ranking numbers, this pinpoints weaknesses in the process. Stakeholder: Part-time BO and Investment Manager = 2 Discretionary stakeholder, and the CPM = 3 Demanding stakeholder. Recommendation: Three recommendations came out of the analysis: 1. Part-time BO passes on accountability for benefit realisation to someone else once they leave, 2. IM incorporates the 3 ‘O’ model currently being used in the PMO to identify benefits clearly in the business case, 3. CPM, IM and BO develop a report specifically on benefits to close the loop with the CCC. The case study concludes by applying the theory to the benefit realisation process again once the recommendations have been incorporated. The results on the three weak rankings of the stakeholders improves to: Part-time BO moved up to a 7 Definitive stakeholder, the IM and the CPM improved to a 6 Dependant. The BO had continuity of accountability with the IM and the CPM having clear and official reporting tools. The IT division were now able to effectively and efficiently report on business benefit realisation and justify the value that they add to the organisation through capital funding initiatives...|$|E

40|$|D. Litt et Phil. Dynamic organisations with {{information}} technology driven infrastructures are invariably {{in a state}} of change, which can be attributed to a multitude of planned (as opposed to forced) interventions. Planned interventions can vary greatly in format and the following serves as examples: • Change required {{as a result of a}} new management structure being introduced. • New systems or technology being implemented. • Processes being improved or changed. • New corporate cultures being established. • Changing market focus. • Business Process Reengineering initiatives. Business process reengineering flowing from a planned intervention would normally culminate in a requirement for a further planned intervention in the form of change management to be implemented. This is required to not only ensure that <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>processes</b> are established <b>to</b> ultimately culminate in sustained process improvement and competitive advantage, but also that the impact of such process changes map to the subsequent cultural and organisational change requirements. Should these entities however be undertaken against the background of a forced intervention, a new approach is required to ensure that not only processes are catered for, but also include behavioural and organisational considerations. Research hypothesis validation was conducted in two organisations of which one served as a Control Group, while the other organisation was split to form two separate and distinct research groups. Into the first research group of the latter organisation (Experimental Group B), the Transformation Process model, which forms the focus of this thesis was introduced to facilitate the implementation of business process reengineering and change management as planned interventions and affirmative action as the forced intervention. In terms of the methodology of the Transformation Process model, any process entity is required to be infused and mapped to a change entity and thereafter superimposed onto the applicable forced intervention in symbiotic unison to test the hypothesis. Into the second research group (Experimental Group A) the same interventions were implemented as in the case of Experimental Group B, however not in terms of the Transformation Process model, but in the traditional way whereby process change was followed by organisational change the latter, which included the forced intervention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShared {{services}} are {{a type of}} intra-corporate activity for support functions such as information technology, finance, purchasing, marketing. Out of these functions, the finance shared {{services are}} singled out in this paper. The activities pertaining to the finance department are analyzed according to The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants ACCA professional standard. Some of these activities are highly suitable to be managed as iterative back-office processes, such as the receivables account and the payables account. We propose several finance shared services business models which we have found evidence of in Romania. Finance shared services may be managed as pools of diversified activities, as simple iterative processes (such as invoices), as <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> accounting <b>processes,</b> or as inclusive solutions which involve other functional areas such as credit management and purchasing. Evidence of Romanian companies providing such services has been collected using Internet resources such as job advertising sites, company web sites and the media. In Romania, {{there are a variety}} of shared service and business process outsourcing providers, such as Continental Automotive, Hella, Oracle, British American Shared Services, Hewlett Packard, Bosch, Accenture, Genpact. The purpose of this paper is to exemplify the benefits brought by one type of shared service and its value proposition potential. This article is part of a research on value based management, in which the particular case of intra-corporate business value pattern is analyzed for production, research and development, and overheads (shared services). Intra-corporate business is managed using the transfer price which is different from the market price, and this is one reason why we call this business model “specific”. The other reason is that Romania as a location offers the very advantages shared service providers seek...|$|R
40|$|Facing the {{new market}} challenges, service {{providers}} {{are looking for}} solutions to improve three major business areas namely the Customer Experience, The Operational Efficiency and Revenue and Margin. To meet the business requiements related to these areas, service providers are going through three major transformation programs namely the Business Support Systems transformation program for Customer related aspects, the Operations Support System transformation program for mainly service Fulfillment and Assurance and Resource, Fulfillment and Assurance, and Time To Market Transformation program for Products ans Services development and management. These transformations are about making a transition from a current situation with all its views to a desired one. The information view transformation is about reorganizing and reengineering the existing information {{to be used for}} the day to day activities and reporting to support decision making. For reporting purpose, service providers have to invest in Business Intelligence solutions. For which the main purpose is to provide the right information in a timely manner to efficiently support the decision making. One of the key BI challenges is to model an information structure where to host all the information coming from multiple sources. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest a step by step methodology to design a Telco Data Mart, one of the fundamental BI components. Order-To-Payment, an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> customer <b>process,</b> will be used as an application for this methodology. Our methodology consists on bringing together the concepts of business intelligence and the telecom business frameworks developed by the TM Forum: the Business Process Framework, the Information Framework, and the Business Metrics. The advantage of this solution is its ability to adapt to any telecom enterprise architecture since it's built around the business standards. Comment: 25 pages, 24 figures, 17 tables, IJCS...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between increases in space mission complexity and rapidly declining space mission budgets has created strong pressures to radically reduce {{the costs of}} designing and operating spacecraft. A key approach to achieving such reductions is through reducing the development and operations costs of the supporting mission operations systems. One of the efforts which the Communications and Data Systems Division at NASA Headquarters is using to meet this challenge is the Mission Operations Control Architecture (MOCA) project. Technical direction of this effort has been delegated to the Mission Operations Division (MOD) of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). MOCA {{is to develop a}} mission control and data acquisition architecture, and supporting standards, to guide the development of future spacecraft and mission control facilities at GSFC. The architecture will reduce the need for around-the-clock operations staffing, obtain a high level of reuse of flight and ground software elements from mission to mission, and increase overall system flexibility by enabling the migration of appropriate functions from the ground <b>to</b> the spacecraft. The <b>end</b> results are <b>to</b> be an established way of designing the spacecraft-ground system interface for GSFC's in-house developed spacecraft, and a specification of the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> spacecraft control <b>process,</b> including data structures, interfaces, and protocols, suitable for inclusion in solicitation documents for future flight spacecraft.

40|$|The {{integration}} of biomedical sensors with wireless net-work technology may have great potentials in medical ap-plications. In this paper, we investigate {{the use of}} the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard in an ECG monitoring sensor network and study the effects of CSMA/CA mechanism, number of network devices, sampling rates and transmitting cycles. The performance of the network is analyzed in terms of transmission delay, <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, and packet delivery rate. Both biomedical signal sampling time and transmis-sion delay contribute <b>to</b> the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, but the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency is mainly introduced by signal sam-pling time, especially for low data rate biomedical sensors. The packet delivery rate increases when the number of pay-load data becomes large due to high channel efficiency and packet coding efficiency, but large size packet suffers high <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency. In our case study, for a full size MAC packet with maximum payload size (114 bytes), the aver-age <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency introduced by sampling and trans-mitting is about 90 ms. For time-critical applications, a payload size between 40 and 60 bytes can be a good choice, due <b>to</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and acceptable packet de-livery rate. In the design and deployment of biomedical sensor networks in time-critical medical care applications, trade-off between <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and packet delivery rate must be considered...|$|R

40|$|International audience—Many WSN {{industrial}} applications impose requirements {{in terms of}} <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> delay. However, the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> delay estimation in WSNs {{is not a simple}} task because of the high dynamic of networks, the use of duty-cycled MAC protocols as well as the impact of the routing protocols. Markov-based modelling is an interesting approach to deal with this problem aiming to provide an analytical model useful for understanding protocol's behavior and <b>to</b> estimate the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> delay, among other performance parameters. However, existing Markov-based analytic models abstract the reality simplifying the analysis and thus resulting models are not accurate enough for estimating the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> delay. Furthermore, establishing an accurate Markov model using classic approaches is very difficult considering the highly dynamic behavior of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtain the Markov chain model of sensor nodes by means of Process Mining techniques through the code execution trace. <b>End</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> delay is then computed based on this Markov chain. Experimentations were done using IoT-LAB testbed platform. Comparisons in terms of delay are presented for two different metrics of the RPL protocol (hop count and ETX) ...|$|R
