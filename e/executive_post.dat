25|$|Gandhi {{comes from}} the Nehru–Gandhi family. Due to {{security}} concerns, Gandhi constantly had to shift schools in his youth. He studied abroad under a pseudonym, his identity being known only to a select few including university officials and security agencies. After obtaining degrees in international relations and development studies at the universities of Rollins and Cambridge, Gandhi worked at the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London, before establishing the Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm, Backops Services Private Ltd. In 2004, Gandhi re-entered public life {{when he ran for}} and won his father's old Lok Sabha (lower house of Indian Parliament) seat of Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. A few years later, in 2007, Gandhi was elected as the General Secretary of the Congress party, an <b>executive</b> <b>post</b> also held in the past by his father, Rajiv Gandhi and by his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. Amidst calls from Congress party veterans for his greater involvement in party politics and national government, Gandhi was elected Congress Vice-President in 2013.|$|E

Li Xiaopeng entered politics in Shanxi province and became its governor in 2012; in 2016 he became Minister of Transport. Li Xiaolin served as chief executive of China Power International Development, before being transferred out in 2016 to a minor <b>executive</b> <b>post</b> at a different power company.|$|E
2500|$|Tapping into growing anger {{with the}} SLFP government, Jayewardene led the UNP to a {{crushing}} {{victory in the}} 1977 election. [...] The UNP won a staggering five-sixths of the seats in parliament—a total that was magnified by the first-past-the-post system, {{and one of the}} most lopsided victories ever recorded for a democratic election. [...] Immediately thereafter, he amended the constitution of 1972 to make the presidency an <b>executive</b> <b>post.</b> [...] The provisions of the amendment automatically made the incumbent prime minister—himself—president, and he was sworn in as president on 4 February 1978. He passed [...] a new constitution on 31 August 1978 which came into operation on 7 September of the same year, which granted the president sweeping—and according to some critics, almost dictatorial—powers. He moved the legislative capital from Colombo to Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{constitution}} also changed the executive branch, abolishing {{the post of}} prime minister. Instead, that post's powers were transferred to the state president, which was converted into an <b>executive</b> <b>post</b> with sweeping powers. [...] He was elected by an electoral college whose members were elected by the three chambers of the Parliament. [...] The president and cabinet had sole jurisdiction over [...] "general affairs." [...] Disputes between the three chambers regarding [...] "general affairs" [...] were resolved by the President's Council, composed of members from the three chambers and members directly appointed by the president. [...] In practice, {{the composition of the}} President's Council and the electoral college made it impossible for the Coloured and Indian chambers to outvote the white chamber even if they voted as a bloc. [...] Thus, the real power remained in white hands—and in practice, in the hands of Botha's National Party.|$|E

He was approached on behalf of the British Government with the suggestion that if he would become a British subject the Government would be pleased to give him an important <b>executive</b> <b>post</b> and with the hint that if he succeeded a title might await him. His answer was: [...] "I'll do what I can for you with pleasure; but I'll be damned if I'll give up my American citizenship—not on your life!" [...] Within the last six months two large financial organizations, each independently, have offered him $100,000 a year to enter their service; and an industrial company offered him $100,000 [...] "to start with."

2500|$|Starting {{in early}} 2005, Cunningham was heavily courted by Lehigh Valley democrats {{to run for}} {{executive}} of Lehigh County. No Democrat had ever won the executive's office since the county's home rule charter {{went into effect in}} 1978, and Lehigh County Democratic Committee Chairman Charles F. Smith Jr. called Cunningham the party's [...] "dream candidate". Cunningham announced his candidacy for the position in March, and he formally resigned from the Rendell administration on April 8. He ran with no opposition in the Democratic primary, clearing the way for a challenge against Republican Executive Jane R. Ervin, who was seeking a second four-year term. During his campaign, Cunningham strongly criticized Ervin for a 69 percent county tax increase in 2003, calling it [...] "unconscionable" [...] declaring that a change in leadership was necessary. Cunningham raised other campaign issues as the election continued, including crime prevention, the cost of a planned courthouse expansion, and priorities in county construction projects. Ervin responded aggressively to Cunningham's campaign, raising questions about his record in Bethlehem and Rendell's administration and defending her tax increase as {{the right thing to do}} for the county. Cunningham defeated Ervin by a margin of 33,263 to 20,721, capturing 62 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat ever elected to the <b>executive</b> <b>post.</b> He had spent roughly $500,000 in the election. The county executive position paid $65,000 annually, a 41 percent cut from Cunningham's salary as a cabinet secretary.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2001, {{politics}} {{were dominated by}} questions about the Grand-Mere Affair. Both the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives frequently charged that Chrétien had broken the law in regards to his lobbying for Business Development Bank for loans to the Auberge Grand-Mère inn. Questions were especially centered around the firing of Business Development Bank president François Beaudoin, and the involvement of Jean Carle, formerly of the PMO, in sacking Beaudoin. Carle served as Chrétien's chief of operations between 1993 and 1998 before leaving to take up an <b>executive</b> <b>post</b> at the Business Development Bank, and was described by Maclean's in 1998 as being {{so close to the}} Prime Minister as to be almost a member of the Chrétien family. Carle and Chrétien were so close that in the 1980s, Chrétien had allowed Carle to live rent-free in his basement at his Ottawa house. Carle was widely seen within the Liberal ranks as Chrétien's [...] "surrogate son". Patrick Lavelle, the chairman of the Business Development Bank, tried to block Carle's appointment on the grounds that he was unsuitable for the post, but after a meeting with Carle's patron Chrétien, felt he had [...] "no choice" [...] but to accept Carle. Chrétien claimed that Carle was not involved in any way with the loans to the Grand-Mere Inn, only to be countered by Joe Clark, who produced a leaked document showing that he was. On February 19, 2001, the RMCP announced that there they did not find sufficient evidence to lay criminal charges against anyone in regards to the Grand-Mere Affair, and Chrétien accused Clark of waging a [...] "witch hunt" [...] against the Liberals. On March 2, 2001, the federal ethics counselor Howard Wilson again cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing in the Grand-Mere Affair. The opposition parties charged that because Wilson was accountable only to the Prime Minister, not Parliament, that he was a puppet of Chrétien's who would never rule against his boss. Recalling that the Red Book of 1993 had promised that the Liberals would appoint an ethics counselor responsible to Parliament, the Canadian Alliance tabled a motion that was a verbatim copy of the Red Book promise, which Chrétien then ordered the Liberals to vote against. One Grit backbencher complained to the media that Chrétien had made the entire caucus [...] "feel like goddamned hypocrites". On April 5, 2001, The National Post received documents purportedly from an anonymous source within the Business Development Bank, dealing with Chrétien's interest in the Auberge Grand-Mère inn, one of which contained a footnote indicating that Chrétien was still owed $23,040 by Duhaime for his share in the Auberge Grand-Mère at the time in 1997 when he was lobbying the Business Development Bank to make a loan to the Auberge Grand-Mère, in which case, presuming the documents are genuine, Chrétien would have broken the law on conflict-of-interest. Chrétien maintained and still maintains that the documents are forgeries done by persons unknown, designed to discredit him. Since 2001, the RCMP has been investigating the alleged forgery, through no suspect has yet emerged, and some such as the journalist Colby Cosh have expressed doubts about Chrétien's forgery claim. The complex issues concerning conflict-of-interest laws, ownership of the Grand-Mere Inn and its golf course, and the firing of Beaudoin did not excite much interest {{on the part of the}} Canadian public.|$|E
