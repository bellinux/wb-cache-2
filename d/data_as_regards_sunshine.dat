The patients’ parents answered a previously validated questionnaire with closed questions to provide <b>data</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> the socio-economic factor. All the information was stored in a database and submitted to descriptive statistical analysis. Results: 61 % of population sample was of the male gender and 92 % was of the white race. The incisive trans-foramen fissure was prevalent (62 %) and the unilateral fissures were most frequent (65. 8 %), and the left side was the most affected (44. 3 %). As regards systemic factors, 22 % of the patients had syndromes or sequences; the most frequently associated syndrome was the Pierre Robin. Among the malformation associated with cleft lip and palate fissures, congenital heart diseases were prevalent (37. 9 %). Family recurrence of fissures was shown in only 23 % of cases. The family nuclei were composed of married parents (84 %), who had higher education (47 %) and worked full time (81 %). Conclusion: There was greater frequency of the incisive trans-foramen fissure and greater occurrence in the male gender.

40|$|Time {{for primary}} review 20 days Moderate {{consumption}} {{of red wine}} has been putatively associated with lowering {{the risk of developing}} coronary heart disease. This beneficial effect is mainly attributed to the occurrence of polyphenol compounds such as anthocyanosides (ACs), catechins, proanthocyanidins (PAs), stilbenes and other phenolics in red wine. This review focuses on the vascular effects of red wine polyphenols (RWPs), with emphasis on anthocyanosides and proanthocyanidins. From in vitro studies, the effect of red wine polyphenols on the vascular tone is thought to be due to short- and long-term mechanisms. NO-mediated vasorelaxation represents the short-term response to wine polyphenols, which exert the effect by increasing the influx of extracellular Ca 2 +, and the mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + in endothelial cells. Polyphenolic compounds may also have long-term properties, as they increase endothelial NO synthase expression acting on the promoter activity. In addition, they decrease the expression of adhesion molecules and growth factors, involved in migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, they inhibit platelet aggregation.

Tremendous {{progress has been}} achieved in unravelling the genetic background of IBD. It {{has led to the}} discovery of mutations in NOD 2 associated with ileal CD and numerous other genes {{have been found to be}} associated with IBD susceptibility. Methods A review of the literature on the genetic background of IBD was performed. Results It is only partially understood how mutations in NOD 2 lead to CD. Mouse models, in vitro data and studies in humans offer conflicting <b>data</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> whether there is a loss or gain of function of NOD 2 in CD. Several additional genes have been identified of which only a few are currently being recognized as potential disease causing or disease modifying genes. Promising candidate genes include TLR 4, MDR 1, NOD 1 (CARD 4), DLG 5 as well as the IBD 5 locus including SLC 22 A 4 / 5. Conclusions Although genetic research has not yet led to a better prediction of the disease course or patient selection for medical therapy, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD. For future genetic research, accurate phenotyping of patients is very important and large population-based cohorts are needed. Eventually, genetic research may be able to classify different disease phenotypes on a more detailed molecular basis and may provide important contributions in the development of new therapeutic approaches...|$|R

One of the aims of SIMIT was to improve the geological and geophysical information in Lampedusa and in Malta and ultimately to mitigate natural hazards. Although this region lies on the Sicily Channel Rift Zone, a seismically active domain of Central Mediterranean, the knowledge about seismotectonic and seismic hazard is not satisfactory. At present, seismic hazard assessment (SHA) for Italy (MPS Working Group, 2004), Tunisia (Ksentini and Romdhane, 2014) and more generally for whole European areas (Giardini et al., 2013) do exist, whereas no specific SHA for the Sicily channel archipelagos are available.

40|$|Abstract Background Health-related {{quality of}} life is a topic of current interest. This paper {{considers}} a randomized phase III study of radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (docetaxel) versus radiation therapy alone in non-small cell lung cancer, stage III A/B. Longitudinal data on {{quality of life}} have been obtained through repeated administration of a multi-item questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C 30) developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Missingness in the data is owing to patients having failed to complete the questionnaire at some of the scheduled filling-in times. Methods We have analysed a monotone (in terms of missingness) subset of the <b>data</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> estimation of the mean score of a summary measure of self-reported quality of life in a hypothetical drop-out-free population at different points in time. Missingness is a difficult issue of great importance. We have therefore chosen to compare three different methods that are relatively easy to implement: the linear-increments method, the inverse-probability-weighting method and the Markov-process method. Single imputation has been applied in a supplementary analysis to fill in for all the non-consecutive missing score values prior to the execution of the estimation procedure. Results For the response in focus, the observed mean score at a certain time is larger than the estimated mean scores, which implies that the true mean score is easily overestimated unless the missingness is appropriately adjusted for. Comparison of the treatment arms shows a significant difference in mean score at the end of treatment. Conclusion Use of proper methodology developed for analysing data subject to missingness is necessary to reduce potential estimation bias. The quality of life of patients receiving radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (docetaxel) appears somewhat worse than that of patients receiving radiation therapy alone in the period during which treatment is given. The conclusions are robust for the choice of statistical methods. </p...|$|R
