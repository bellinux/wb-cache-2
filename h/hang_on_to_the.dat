25|$|The airport's {{value was}} {{estimated}} at NOK20 million. A sabotage of the drainage system was discovered in 1949, which explained many of the technical challenges affiliated with the runways. This was decisive in putting off the military desire to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> facility. Sola Air Station took the three large hangars and a barracks into use, {{while the rest of}} the airfield was decommissioned. A NOK6.7 million estimate to bring the airport back into shape was found to be not worth the cost.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} in the box office, Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews from critics. It was looked upon as scandalous once it was {{released}} because it portrayed Vince Everett as an anti-heroic character, presented a convict as a hero, used the word [...] "hell" [...] as a profanity, and included a scene showing Presley in bed with co-star Tyler. The Parent-Teacher Association described the movie as [...] "a hackneyed, blown-up tale with cheap human values." [...] The New York Times criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay where the secondary characters whom Mickey Shaughnessey and Judy Tyler acted out were [...] "forced to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hero's flying mane and ego for the entire picture." [...] Cue magazine called the film [...] " [...] unpleasant, mediocre and tasteless drama." ...|$|E
500|$|The club's {{failure to}} gain {{promotion}} {{meant that it}} was unable to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ambitious Cascarino, who was sold to Millwall for £225,000, but despite {{the loss of the}} team's star striker the Gills' 1987–88 season began with a flurry of goals. [...] On consecutive Saturdays Gillingham beat Southend United 8–1 and Chesterfield 10–0 (the latter a new club record for a professional match), but the early-season promise faded and in December Peacock was controversially sacked after a 6–0 defeat to Aldershot. [...] His assistant, Paul Taylor, was promoted to manager, but after an unsuccessful spell in charge Taylor was himself replaced in October 1988 by former Tottenham Hotspur manager Keith Burkinshaw. [...] Burkinshaw was unable to turn the team's fortunes around, however, and departed shortly before the club's relegation to Division Four was confirmed {{at the end of the}} 1988–89 season.|$|E

Also in 1859 they remodeled the First Congregational Church in Keene, New Hampshire. Like much of Boyden's work at the time, it featured a monumental Italianate facade.

40|$|How {{should one}} place oneself within the present iconosphere, {{at a time}} when {{everything}} seems to be hyper documented? What can be done with the plethora of images surrounding us? And is there anything left for us to read in these objects that have already been discussed over and over again? The filmmaker Harun Farocki <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that his documentaries can make images speak in new and different ways. Also, while traditional iconology sees the image as a crossword puzzle with only one possible interpretation, Georges Didi-Huberman argues for a critical montage aiming <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> openness of the images in order to deploy their multiple meanings. What is at stake here is the very construction of "the eye of history," an alternative viewpoint allowing for a kind of reading that would free the document from the strictures of homogenizing interpretations. The montage as understood by Didi- Huberman restores the complexity of the visual, thus placing itself in stark opposition to traditional authoritarian ap- proaches. This paper explores the role of a "pedagogy of the document" in liberating knowledge from automatized modes of reading. Peer reviewe...|$|R
