The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish charitable organisation which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund has since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle. The plan is to develop the site for the enjoyment of visitors, with improved pathways, a nature trail and information points about the heritage of the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of what Page did in the obscure years after modeling was answered <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> the publication of an official biography in 1996, Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-up Legend.

Pratt's Flower Folk. She continued this work even after she was routinely selling out her exhibitions of pastels and watercolors and gaining commissions for her miniatures.|$|E
25|$|The African Lakes Company’s failure lay <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> {{its lack}} of the {{finances}} to realise its ambitious plans, {{but also because it}} thought that trading in ivory and in slaves were intimately connected, as David Livingstone among others had observed recently-enslaved Africans being forced to carry ivory to the coast. However, by the 1870s, most ivory porters were paid specialists, and the relation between in ivory and slaves was a negative one: the increasing European demand for ivory led to a depletion of the elephant herds in many areas, whose people were then forced to sell slaves in exchange for the trade goods they had formerly bartered for ivory.|$|E
