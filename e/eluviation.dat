50|$|The {{process of}} removal of {{materials}} from geological or soil horizons is called <b>eluviation</b> or leaching. There {{is a difference}} in the usage of this term in geology and soil science. In soil science, <b>eluviation</b> is the transport of soil material from upper layers of soil to lower levels by downward precipitation of water across soil horizons, and accumulation of this material (illuvial deposit) in lower levels is called illuviation. In geology, the removed material is irrelevant, and the deposit (eluvial deposit) is the remaining material. <b>Eluviation</b> occurs when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{moisture}} content and water {{flow through the}} soil profile support leaching of soluble constituents, and <b>eluviation.</b> <b>Eluviation</b> is the translocation of colloid material, such as organic matter, clay and other mineral compounds.

Nusantara Bioscience 8 : 83 - 88. Post open pit mining may in most cases leave unarable and {{degraded}} lands due to heavy soil disturbances and therefore reclamation efforts of such area should be addressed on the revitalization of the soil functions for plant growth. The capability of tropical humid soils, including post open pit mining soils, to support plant growth is largely determined by their organic matter content-nutrient pool, soil aggregation, microbial activity, etc. However, soil organic matter content is, to large extent, governed by the soil clay content which is most likely permanent. This may imply that the soil texture couple with soil organic matter content could be a sound measurement to assess the recovery stages of the mined-out lands in term of soil functions for plant growth. This research was conducted in three sites of reclamation area in Berau, East Kalimantan. Soil texture varied from moderately fine (35 - 40 % clay) to fine (40 - 50 % clay) and very fine (> 50 % clay) for the BMO, SMO and LMO sites respectively. Soil clay <b>eluviations</b> were found in both of SMO (8 years old revegetation) and BMO (> 12 years old revegetation) sites but not in LMO site. Soil organic matter content ranged from very low (12 and 8 years old revegetation when the organic matter content reaching its maximum. The very fine soil texture does not show clay <b>eluviations</b> process until > 12 years old revegetation even containing the highest organic C content and reaches its maximum at 8 - 10 years old revegetation...|$|R

However, phosphate amendments contain large amounts of phosphorus, which could leach out to potentially contaminate groundwater and surface water. A laboratory column leaching experiment was designed to study the effects of simulated acid rain (SAR) on the potential release of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and phosphorus (P), and their availability after immobilizing with hydroxyapatite (HAP) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (PDP). The application of HAP and PDP enhanced the leachate electrical conductivity, total organic carbon, and pH. Higher P was found in the PDP- (> 4. 29 mg L- 1) and HAP-treated (> 1. 69 mg L- 1) columns than that in untreated (< 0. 2 mg L- 1) columns, and they were both over the class V limit (0. 4 mg L- 1) mandated by the Chinese National Quality Standards for Surface Waters (GB 3838 - 2002). PDP application decreased the leachate Cu, Pb, and Cd effectively; however, HAP addition increased leachate Cu and Pb. HAP and PDP applications decreased the soil CaCl 2 -extractable and exchangeable fraction of Cu, Pb, and Cd, and increased resin P. However, <b>eluviations</b> transformed the heavy metals from inactive to active fractions and reduced soil labile P. These findings showed that HAP and PDP had a potential risk of excessive P-induced eutrophication. Meanwhile, more attention should be paid to the leaching loss of multiple metals because phosphate amendments might promote the leaching of some metals while immobilizing others...|$|R

The nitrogen mineralization in surface soil, NO 3 - -N dynamics and distribution in soil profile, and N 2 O emission were investigated. Eight treatments {{were laid out}} randomizing with three replications in 24 plots: maize plantation without fertilizer (CK 1), bare soil without maize plantation and fertilization (CK 2), swine manure (S 1, S 2), poultry manure (P 1, P 2), and cattle manure (C 1, C 2). Three manures were applied at two application levels (15 t/hm 2 and 30 t/hm 2). The results indicated that NH 4 + -N in surface soil showed the same temporal pattern without much variation among different treatments. But NO 3 - -N in the same layer exhibited large temporal pattern in all treatments, which was mainly due to its easy <b>eluviations</b> of NO 3 - -N in soil, its transformation to N 2 O {{and the influence of}} precipitation. The distribution of NO 3 - -N in the soil profile during maize growing season showed the leaching tendency from surface soil to subsoil, which was different among the treatments. The poultry treatments showed the largest leaching tendency. The study also revealed that the emissions of N 2 O were affected by the application of organic manures in the order of P 2 > S 2 > C 2 > P 1 > S 1 > C 1 > CK 1 > CK 2. All these results showed that organic manure applications significantly affect {{nitrogen transformation}} and distribution in maize soil.

Tais solos foram, até então, pouco estudados e se caracterizam pela ocorrência de um horizonte B plânico subjacente a um horizonte B textural, plíntico ou não. No município de Ouricuri, foram selecionados três perfis representativos destes solos, classificados como: Plintossolo Argilúvico eutrófico planossólico sódico (perfil 1); Argissolo Amarelo eutrófico planossólico solódico (perfil 2) e Argissolo Amarelo eutrófico plíntico planossólico sódico (perfil 3). A mineralogia das frações calhau e cascalho foi determinada macroscopicamente, enquanto a da areia, por lupa binocular. As frações silte e argila foram analisadas por difratometria de raios X. As descrições micromorfológicas foram {{realizadas}} em seções delgadas de amostras de horizontes selecionados. A fração areia destes solos é essencialmente composta por quartzo, mas feldspatos e mica também ocorrem a partir do horizonte 2 Btbn. O silte é basicamente constituído por quartzo, feldspatos e mica. A argila é composta por caulinita, mica, interestratificados irregulares, esmectita e quartzo, ocorrendo as maiores quantidades de esmectita e interestratificados nos horizontes 2 Btbn e 2 BCn. O horizonte B plânico (2 Btbn) apresenta microestrutura em blocos angulares e expressivos argilãs (de iluviação e intemperização), enquanto o horizonte Bt sobrejacente apresenta microestrutura granular e ausência de qualquer tipo de argilã. A disparidade observada na mineralogia da fração argila e as distintas feições micromorfológicas corroboram a identificação de uma mudança de material de origem entre os horizontes Bt e B plânico dos solos estudados. A posição do horizonte B plânico, que apresenta muitos argilãs de iluviação, e a ausência de características que evidenciem mobilização de argila do Bt precedente revelam uma paleopedogênese para o solo. Estes resultados indicam que os solos foram desenvolvidos em duas etapas. As rochas do embasamento cristalino sofreram uma primeira pedogênese, da qual o marco atual de evidência é a camada de litofragmentos, em sua maioria arestados, que ocorre no topo do B plânico, e que foi, provavelmente, acumulada pela erosão diferencial, formando um pavimento desértico. Posteriormente, os solos foram recobertos por camadas de sedimentos intemperizados, relacionados com a Chapada do Araripe, que se misturaram, em proporções variadas, ao material já edafizado das rochas do embasamento. Estes materiais estão, desde sua deposição, sendo retrabalhados pelos processos pedogenéticos atuais. The {{objective of}} the present study was to characterize the mineralogy and micromorphology of soils with stagnic properties from the micro region of Araripina, in the Sertão Zone of Pernambuco State aiming to improve the understanding of their properties and pedogenic processes. Up to now, these soils have been poorly studied. They are characterized by the presence of a solodic or natric B horizon underlying a normal argic B horizon. Three representative soil profiles were selected in Ouricuri County. According to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources they are classified as: Natric Stagnic Sesquisol (profile 1); Solodic Stagnic Lixisol (profile 2), and Plinthic Stagnic Lixisol (profile 3). The mineralogy of the coarse fractions was determined macroscopically or by using a binocular magnifying lens, while the silt and clay fractions were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Selected horizons were micromorphologically described based on thin soil sections. The sand fraction of the studied soils is essentially composed by quartz, but feldspars and micas were also detected in the 2 Btbn horizons. The silt fraction contains mostly quartz, feldspars and mica. The clay fraction is composed by kaolinite, mica, irregular interstratified minerals, smectite, and quartz. The highest amount of smectites and interstratified clay minerals were observed in the 2 Btbn and 2 BCn horizons. The solodic or natric B horizons (2 Btbn) is characterized by the presence of a blocky microstructure and well developed illuviation and weathering argillans, while the overlying argic B horizon has a granular microstructure and no argillans. The differences observed in the clay mineralogy and micromorphological features between the argic B horizon and the underlying poorly drained solodic or natric B horizon indicate the presence of two parent materials. The position of this Na-rich B horizon, which is high in argillans, and the absence of evidences of clay <b>eluviations</b> from the overlying argic B horizon suggest a paleopedogenesis for this horizon. Results indicate that the soils were developed in two stages. The first pedogenesis occurred on the crystalline rock basement. One of the evidences is the edged stone layer on top of the solodic or natric B horizon, probably formed because of differential erosion, originating a desertic pavement. Afterwards, the soils were covered by layers of highly weathered sediments, related to the Araripe high tableland, which were mixed at varied proportions with the topsoil of the underlying weathered parent material. Both materials have been affected by current pedogenic processes since their deposition...|$|R
50|$|These sub-processes include mobilisation, <b>eluviation</b> and illuviation. Mobilisation and <b>eluviation</b> both move organic {{materials}} and minerals through the A horizon into the B horizon. During this, they react {{with the water}} (illuviation) to become oxidised. This process of podzolisation results in the characteristic soil profile of spodosols, in which the E horizon is usually an ashen grey or white colour without structure {{and there is a}} distinctive hardpan oxide layer in the B horizon (which is always darker than the E horizon). The E horizon can be dark grey in profiles which are high in organic matter, but in such cases the underlying B is very dark.

50|$|A catena forms {{when the}} climate, {{including}} precipitation and evaporation, {{is the same}} for the whole slope, and when sufficient time has passed for equilibrium to be reached between the processes that bring materials in to a facet and the processes that take materials away. The result is a predictable sequence of soil facets. A catena is thus an open system which has continuous input and output processes. On a steeper slope {{in the middle of a}} catena, erosion, such as by runoff, is faster, so facets are typically thinner and drier. Conversely, on a shallower slope at the top or bottom of a catena, soils are thicker and deeper. In addition, the top facets lose materials such as mineral salts when these are washed out by rain (<b>eluviation),</b> while the bottom facets gain materials when these are washed in (illuviation).|$|E
50|$|Water is {{essential}} for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the regolith. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site topography, and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers (<b>eluviation)</b> to the lower layers (illuviation), including clay particles and dissolved organic matter. It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters. Thus, percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons. Likewise, a deficiency of water {{is a major factor}} in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions. Soluble salts are not leached from these soils, and in some cases they build up to levels that curtail plant and microbial growth. Soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays (calcrete or caliche horizons). In tropical soils, when the soil has been deprived of vegetation (e.g. by deforestation) and thereby is submitted to intense evaporation, the upward capillary movement of water, which has dissolved iron and aluminum salts, is responsible for the formation of a superficial hard pan of laterite or bauxite, respectively, which is improper for cutivation, a known case of irreversible soil degradation (lateritization, bauxitization).|$|E

This process is common in many soil types and responsible {{for the development of}} a textural differentiation in soil profiles in the subsurface. However, the mechanisms of lessivage are still poorly understood, and to our knowledge, lessivage has rarely been quantified.

We paid special attention to the experimental conditions, so that the conditions were favourable for lessivage and as close as possible to field conditions. The <b>eluviation</b> experiment showed that the release of particles was not the determining process for lessivage. We also showed that the smectite selectivity of <b>eluviation</b> was not continuous overtime. Both physical and chemical processes were identified as acting on both <b>eluviation</b> and illuviation.

According to their fate, parent limestones comprised three Zn pools: bound to calcite and pyritesphalerite grains, bound to phyllosilicates and bound to goethite in the inherited phosphate nodules. Four pedological processes, i. e., carbonate dissolution, {{two stages of}} redox processes and <b>eluviation,</b> redistributed Zn during pedogenesis. The carbonate dissolution of limestones released Zn bound to calcite into soil solution. Due to residual enrichment, Zn concentrations in the soil are higher than those in parent limestones. Birnessite, ferrihydrite and goethite dispersed in soil horizon trapped high quantities of Zn during their formation. Afterwards, primary redox conditions induced the release of Zn and Fe into soil solution, and the subsequent individualization of Fe and Mn into Zn-rich concretions. Both processes and subsequent aging of the concretions formed induced significant exportation of Zn through the bottom water table. Secondary redox conditions promoted the weathering of Fe and Mn oxides in cements and concretions. This process caused other losses of Zn through lateral exportation in an upper water table. Concomitantly, <b>eluviation</b> occurred {{at the top of}} the solum.

Illuviation was experienced on a column made of undisturbed loamy horizon (L 1) lying on a second undistrurbed monolith of a loamy horizon (called L 2) having contrasting mineralogical and physicochemical properties.

We therefore analyzed Cu concentrations and stable isotope ratios (δ 65 Cu values) in a drained Retisol to trace the response of Cu to a changing hydrological regime and enhanced clay <b>eluviation.</b> The study soil was artificially drained 16 years before sampling resulting in macroscopically visible pedogenetic changes and is thus a suitable site to investigate the influence of pedogenetic processes {{on the fate of}} Cu. Samples were collected from all horizons along a trench at four distances from the drain: 0. 6 m, 1. 1 m, 2. 1 m and 4. 0 m. In the E&Bt horizon, four different soil volumes (ochre, pale brown, white-grey and black) were sampled at all four distances from the drain. Furthermore, we analyzed soil solutions sampled with piezometer, porous cups, and at the drain outlet. The Cu concentrations were lowest in the surface (Ap) horizons (6. 5 – 8. 5 μg g− 1) and increased with depth to the clay-rich Bt horizons (10. 5 – 12 μg g− 1), because of clay <b>eluviation</b> and associated Cu transport. The δ 65 Cu values significantly decreased from the surface (Ap = − 0. 25 ± 0. 07 ‰) to the deeper horizons, but showed no significant variation among the deeper horizons (− 0. 41 ± 0. 28 ‰) and no correlation with the clay content, indicating that clay <b>eluviation</b> did not significantly affect δ 65 Cu values. The isotopically heavier δ 65 Cu values in the Ap horizons can probably be explained by agricultural management practices like sludge application and fertilization. Close to the drain (position 0. 6 m), Cu concentrations were depleted and the lighter Cu isotope was enriched (− 0. 91 ± 0. 15 ‰) in the uppermost part of the E&Bt horizon. We attribute this to the changing redox conditions, caused by the lowering of the water level close to the drain. Copper concentrations in black and ochre volumes were significantly higher than in pale-brown and white-grey volumes. The black volume had significantly higher δ 65 Cu values than the ochre volume indicating preferential sorption/occlusion of the heavy Cu isotope by Fe oxides. Enhanced clay <b>eluviation</b> in bulk soil close to the drain and in specific soil volumes did not affect δ 65 Cu values. Cu concentrations (2. 1 – 14 μg L− 1) and δ 65 Cu (0. 04 – 0. 42 ‰) values in water samples showed no clear relation with redox changes along the trench perpendicular to the drain. The enrichment of the heavy Cu isotope in the solution samples (Δ 65 Cu(soil-solution) = − 0. 61 ± 0. 41) indicates that reductive Cu mobilization is not the main driver of Cu leaching, because this would preferentially mobilize isotopically light Cu. We conclude that the <b>eluviation</b> of the < 2 μm fraction, strongly controlled Cu concentrations, but had no discernible effect on δ 65 Cu values. The changing redox conditions did not seem to control Cu concentrations and the stable isotope distribution in most of the bulk soil, soil volumes and soil water.

In the Iranian soil layer we will find: decayed parent materials, decaying plant material, decaying animal matter (manure) along with vegetation. Results {{of the present study}} show us that methods stimulating natural fertility in Iran includes composting-adds humus layer, drip irrigation-balances illuviation and <b>eluviation</b> in arid regions, crop rotation/ intercropping-reflects natural diversity and limits gleization, add lime-reduces gleization, non-cultivation techniques-reduces hard pan (calcification) caused by compaction and reduce pesticide use-keeps decomposers alive in humus layer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{heterogenous}} {{natural conditions}} on the Dolj District there were formed an array of soils from the sandy ones to the luvic and stagnogleic ones. The sandy soils that were formed {{under the influence of}} Danube River occupy large surfaces on the south western part of the Dolj District and have a high content of basic elements and have a somehow higher fertility than the ones formed on the jiu valley. Generally, the sandy soils from Dolj District have a low fertility status determined by the higher thick material content, higher water permeability and reduced mineral elements content. The salty soils are present within the Jiu lowland and Danube lowland as discontinuous surfaces where the watertable is shallow. In this zones, along with solonetz and solonceak are encountered on smaller surfaces alluvial soils as salty ones that are low to average salinisated. The luvosoils occupies the plateau zone of the dolj District, within the low zones where the water logs a longer period during the year determining <b>eluviation</b> phenomena as well as stagnogleisation of the shallow soil profile and helps creating a not quite favorable environment for plant growing. The reddish preluvosoils and stagnogleisated ones are encountered especially on the northern zone of the district on the plateau that have no drainage where the water logging determines <b>eluviation</b> processes and stagnogleisation, especially on the upper soil profile. Generally, within {{the northern part of the}} district the soils from the slopes have different erosion degrees that determine the decreasing of their fertility...|$|E
40|$|Drop impact, a {{key process}} of {{particle}} mobilization in interrill erosion, {{has been largely}} neglected as a mobilization mechanism {{in the realm of}} colloid-facilitated transfer (CFT) research. We investigated the contribution of drop impact to the <b>eluviation</b> of silt and clay particles from repacked samples of 6 -mm-thick, fine earth (< 2 mm) or 2 - to 4 -mm aggregates under simulated rainfall conditions. Samples were initially moist or dry, and protected or not from drop impact. The results indicated a complex, three-way interaction between the aggregation status, initial water content, and drop impact. Drop impact was a major contributor to particle mobilization on moist samples, increasing by a factor of three to four the mobilization that was observed without drop impact. The initial status of aggregation and the initial water content of the soil interacted to govern the rate of surface seal development and surface ponding, which are believed to interfere with the particle release process. Initially dry samples were most susceptible to sealing and released fewer particles than initially moist samples. In some cases, a first-order equation to predict particle <b>eluviation</b> as a function of cumulative rainfall energy appeared to be a reasonable approximation, at least up to about 400 J m(- 2) of cumulative rainfall kinetic energy. Current modeling efforts that do not take drop impact into account are clearly limited in their predictive capacity when applied to bare soils. Greater interactions between the CFT and interrill erosion research communities may help advance the understanding and modeling of particle release in the topsoil by drop impact...|$|E
40|$|As the {{environment}} influences soil formation, Quaternary loess-paleosols provide an important, yet complex source on former climate and vegetation conditions. This study revises the paleopedological {{record of the}} Rocourt-complex, the pedostratigraphic marker for the Eemian and early Weichselian in the Belgian loess belt. Depth functions were established from an exceptionally well-preserved, in-situ sequence. Based on soil micromorphological features, total element contents, iron fractions and carbon content a reconstruction {{was made of the}} polygenetic formation of the Rocourt soil. Results indicate that only by combining multiple soil features, consistent information could be obtained. Furthermore, this study shows that cryogenic processes, transport of colloids, iron dynamics, redox-conditions, organic matter formation and biological activity were major soil forming processes. The hypothesis of six major stages of soil formation under varying climatic conditions was most supported by the data. During the warm to temperate oceanic climate of the Eemian, a strongly weathered argic horizon was formed. This horizon was later disrupted by reticulate ice segregation and stagnogley during the severe and prolonged cold conditions of the first cold stadial following the Eemian. Weak soil formation, during the relatively short continental St. Germain I interstadial, subsequently formed cambic soil properties and a humiferous horizon in a mixture of local and new sediments. These soils were disrupted by fragipan Formation, with its associated cryogenic structure, banded <b>eluviation</b> and redoxfront, during the succeeding stadial with periglacial conditions. During the St. Germain II, another A horizon formed in new, calcareous material during more stable climatic conditions, allowing organic matter build-up, <b>eluviation</b> of smectite and formation of pedogenetic iron. During the evolution from this warmer climate with forest or forested steppe to eventually periglacial open tundra, an accretionary humiferous soil concluded the last episode of soil formation before the onset of pleniglacial Weichselian conditions.

40|$|Phosphorus {{content and}} balance in granulometric {{fractions}} of old alluvial soil developed from alluvial deposits od Vistula River in middle Poland was studied. The distribution of phosphorus in particular granulometric fractions of the studied soil showed high quantitative variability vertically in the profile. This {{resulted from the}} layered structure of the Vistulian old alluvial formation developed throughout the Holocene. The contribution of grain fractions in phosphorus accumulation increased with a decrease in their diameter, and in certain fractions with a decrease in their quantitative state. <b>Eluviation</b> of phosphorus down the soil profile concerned in particular grain fraction < 0. 02 mm.
