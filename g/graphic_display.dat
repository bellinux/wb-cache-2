5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour <b>graphic</b> <b>display.</b> Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

The new studio was divided into five {{different}} sections on the lower level including an interview area, the couch area, the news desk, the performance/interview/extra space area, and home base, {{which is where the}} anchors start the show. A gigantic Panasonic 103-inch plasma monitor is often used for <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> backgrounds. A kitchen set is located upstairs from the main studio. The blue background that is seen in the opening of the show in home base moves up and down to allow a view of the outside from the home base.|$|E

In theory, the method (called [...] "RGB Decimation" [...] internally) can enhance the anti-aliasing of any digital image.|$|E

[...] Sharkey expressed approval, stating Shank is [...] "bloody, violent, adolescently indulgent, and absolutely beautiful in execution." [...] Shea stated it is [...] "a savage game that revels in the brutality of street fighting."

2500|$|In a major 1996 report, the Waitangi Tribunal {{claimed the}} events at Parihaka {{provided}} a <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> of government antagonism to any show of Māori political independence. It noted: [...] "A vibrant and productive Māori community was destroyed and total State {{control of all}} matters Māori, with full power over the Māori social order, was sought." [...] Historian Hazel Riseborough also believed the central issue motivating the invasion was mana: [...] "Europeans were concerned about their superiority and dominance which, it seemed to them, could be assured only by destroying Te Whiti's mana. As long as he remained at Parihaka he constituted a threat to European supremacy in that he offered his people {{an alternative to the}} way of life the European sought to impose on them." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be of}} {{significant}} aid in accomplishing a teleoperation task throughout all three phases of off-line task analysis and planning, operator training, and online operation. In the first phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> provide substantial aid to investigate work cell layout, motion planning with collision detection and with possible redundancy resolution, and planning for camera views. In the second phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> can serve as very useful tools for introductory training of operators before training them on actual hardware. In the third phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be used for}} previewing planned motions and monitoring actual motions in any desired viewing angle, or, when communication time delay prevails, for providing predictive graphics overlay on the actual camera view of the remote site to show the non-time-delayed consequences of commanded motions in real time. This paper addresses potential space applications of <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> in all three operational phases of advanced teleoperation. Possible applications are illustrated with techniques developed and demonstrated in the Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory at JPL. The examples described include task analysis and planning of a simulated Solar Maximum Satellite Repair task, a novel force-reflecting teleoperation simulator for operator training, and preview and predictive displays for on-line operations...|$|R
