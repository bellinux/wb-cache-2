40|$|A 1 : 50 scale {{hydraulic}} model was designed based on Froude Number similarity using hydrological and sediment {{data from a}} braided gravel-bed river (the North Branch of the Ashburton River, Canterbury, New Zealand). An experimental programme was devised to investigate firstly, the relationships between discharge-slope product and bedload transport rate under steady and varying discharges; and secondly, the changes in bedload transport rate resulting from flow abstractions. Seven experiments using steady flow conditions were conducted (with six different discharge-slope combinations), and eleven experiments using unsteady flow conditions were also conducted (with five different discharge-slope combinations). The experiments were carried out in a 20 m x 3 m tilting flume equipped with a sediment <b>feed</b> <b>device</b> and an automated data acquisition and control system. In all experiments water at 30 °c was used to reduce viscosity-related scale effects. Braided stream development was in some experiments found to be limited by the 3 m flume width; however, using available data from the narrower reaches of the North Branch of the Ashburton River, it was shown that good hydraulic similarity was achieved. Analyses of the experimental results revealed that bedload transport rates in braided channels are highly variable, with relative variability being inversely related to mean bedload transport rate. Variability was also found to be cyclic with short-term variations being caused by the migration of bedforms. Assessments of two bedload transport prediction rate equations were made: the Schoklitsch (1962) equation and the Bagnold (1980) equation. It was concluded that the Schoklitsch (1962) equation {{is unlikely to be}} useful for braided gravel-bed rivers, however the Bagnold (1980) equation was found to be very reliable, with the experimental data displaying a close adherence to the empirical 3 / 2 power-law dependence of bedload transport rate on excess stream power which is the basis of this equation. Average bedload transport rate was found to be dependent on channel form, although insufficient measurements were made to define the relationship. Bedload transport was found to be more efficient under steady flow than under unsteady flow, and it was postulated that this is caused by a tendency for channel form to evolve towards a condition which maximises bedload transport for the occurring flow. Using the results from the unsteady flow experiments, it was shown that stream power is a reliable basis for predicting the bedload transport capacity reductions caused by flow abstractions from braided rivers...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} is focused on the dynamics and stability of thin liquid films flowing over heterogeneous surfaces, which are involved in numerous applications ranging from coating processes to microfluidics devices. Because of the small height-to-length ratio of the thin film, interfacial forces dominate the hydrodynamics in such flows. For thin films flowing over a locally heated substrate, the temperature gradient at the free surface induces a surface tension gradient, or Marangoni stress, at the liquid-gas interface. The flow due to this stress redistributes liquid from warmer to cooler regions, creating a pronounced bump in the film profile that is susceptible to a hydrodynamic instability that can cause a degradation in microdevice performance. Since a gradient in surface tension can also be induced by a surfactant concentration gradient, the thin film flowing over a locally heated substrate may behave markedly differently in the presence of surfactant. Utilizing the appropriate simplifications of lubrication theory, evolution equations are derived for the local film thickness and surfactant concentration, and predictions based on nonlinear and linearized equations of state for the surface tension are compared. Despite a localized accumulation of surfactant near the upstream edge of the heater, the predictions of the two models are found to be in good agreement. More significantly, a detailed linear stability analysis reveals that the surfactant stabilizes the film. The physical mechanism for this stabilization is discussed and linked to a qualitative change in the kinematics associated with the elimination of fluid recirculation near the heater. The effect of surfactant is also investigated for films over isothermal, inclined substrates with topographical features and for the dynamics of a film on a heated, horizontal substrate with topographical features. In the absence of surfactant, the effect of inertia on the stability of a liquid film flowing over a locally heated substrate is investigated by incorporating the leading-order term for inertia within the framework of lubrication approximation. The linear stability analysis and the energy analysis reveal that the inertial term destabilizes the film. ^ The second part of this dissertation is focused on two fundamental studies relevant to the pyrolysis of biomass. The heating of a biomass particle produces a temperature gradient within the particle, which creates spatially varying reaction rates. A reaction-transport model is developed to investigate the significance of intra- and extra-particle heat transfer effects on the pyrolysis of nonporous particles of cellulose, a major component of lignocellulosic biomass. Recently measured kinetic parameters are incorporated. The explicit shrinkage of a biomass particle undergoing pyrolysis is related to the overall mass loss as gaseous products are formed. Numerical predictions for measurable properties, including the temporal evolution of the residual mass and the final yield of char, which is an undesired byproduct, are validated through comparison to experimental data for various particle sizes and external temperatures. The particles are found to be sufficiently non-isothermal during typical processing conditions that heat transfer influences the char and product yield. Extensions are made to the pyrolysis of porous biomass particles. ^ In continuous flow processing, the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass typically occurs in a fluidized bed reactor. Solid biomass particles enter the reactor along with a carrier gas through a vertical standpipe, decompose, and produce condensable vapors that can be further processed into biofuel. Due to the coupling of the hydrodynamics to the rate of particle decomposition, the selection of appropriate operating conditions for the <b>feed</b> <b>device</b> can be challenging. For inert gas-solid flows, rich nonlinear dynamics can be observed due to momentum transfer between the phases through the drag force coupled to the compressibility of the gas. For decomposing solids as in pyrolysis, the exchange of mass between the phases further complicates the hydrodynamics. Using the approach of interacting and interpenetrating continua, a one-dimensional, steady-state model is developed for the gravity-driven flow of gas and decomposing particles through a vertical standpipe. The theory yields the particle and gas flow rates, the pressure profile, and the particle size and void fraction distributions. Preferred operating conditions are identified to produce steady flow, avoid a transition to moving bed flow, and provide desired values of the pressure, particle size, and solids flow rate at the pipe exit. Applications are made to the pyrolysis of wood particles. The admissible range of operating conditions is found to increase with the particle decomposition rate, which increases strongly with temperature. ...|$|E
