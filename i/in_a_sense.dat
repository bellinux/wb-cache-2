5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision rules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E
50|$|Before the Middle Ages {{there was}} a logical debate among Islamic logicians, {{philosophers}} and theologians over whether the term qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real <b>sense</b> and analogical reasoning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> metaphorical <b>sense.</b> On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058-1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that qiyas refers to analogical reasoning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real <b>sense</b> and categorical syllogism <b>in</b> <b>a</b> metaphorical <b>sense.</b> Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real <b>sense.</b>|$|R

A system may well be stable <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time <b>sense</b> (persistent) without being stable <b>in</b> <b>an</b> energy <b>sense.</b> The familiar concept of kinetic stability characterizes that other stability kind, as exemplified by a hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture.

5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, {{engagement}} between Russian and Turkish battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> the mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade.

This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over {{the conduct of the}} war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{after the death of}} Augustus, the Roman Empire was, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> a union of inchoate principalities, which could have {{disintegrated}} at any time. In 68 AD, Ser. Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was proclaimed Emperor by his troops. In Rome, the emperor Nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide. The governor of Lower Germany, A. Vitellius, was soon proclaimed Emperor by his troops, and in Rome, the Praetorian Guard proclaimed M. Salvius Otho Emperor. In 69, Galba was assassinated and Otho took an army to Germany to defeat Vitellius, but instead was himself defeated. He committed suicide, and Vitellius was proclaimed Emperor, but was quickly defeated and the executed by Vespasian, who was then declared Emperor. Under the Emperor Vespasian, the Roman constitution began a slide toward outright monarchy. Vespasian died in 79, and was succeeded by his son, Titus, who presided over a further weakening of the senate. He was succeeded by his brother, Domitian, in 81. Domitian's reign marked a significant turning point on the road to monarchy, as he made himself Censor for life, and unlike his father, used these powers to further subjugate the Senate. Domitian, ultimately, was a tyrant with the character which always makes tyranny repulsive, and this derived in part from his own paranoia, which itself was a consequence {{of the fact that he}} had no son, and thus no obvious heir. In September 96, Domitian was assassinated.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{religious}} beliefs {{date back to}} the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek {{religious beliefs}}. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.|$|E
5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> be reborn in his son.|$|E
