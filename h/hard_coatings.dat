EHC coatings are very tough, in fact no cracks could be produced with 10 N Vickers microindentations. However, their superficial morphology and Vickers microhardness are significantly affected by the substrate preparation technique, the deposition process characteristics, and by post-deposition treatments. This causes the coatings to show different behaviors in different wear conditions; in particular, <b>harder</b> <b>coatings</b> are more abrasion-resistant, but undergo a more severe mass loss under unlubricated sliding conditions. HVOF-sprayed cermet <b>coatings</b> are <b>harder</b> but less tough than EHC ones. Therefore, they undergo a comparable or even higher mass loss when subjected to three-body abrasion conditions. However, their two-body sliding resistance definitely overcomes that of EHC coatings, because they form a tough and uniform surface film protecting them from further damage...|$|R
