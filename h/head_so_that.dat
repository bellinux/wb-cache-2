25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her <b>head</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The {{back of her head}} and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E

500|$|Damage to the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) {{will lead to}} ipsilateral weakness in the trapezius muscle. This can be tested by asking the subject to raise their shoulders or shrug, upon which the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position. [...] Additionally, if the nerve is damaged, weakness or an inability to elevate the scapula may be present because the levator scapulae muscle is now solely able to provide this function. Depending on {{the location of the}} lesion there may also be weakness present in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which acts to turn the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the face points to the opposite side.|$|E
500|$|Demosthenes {{started to}} learn rhetoric because {{he wished to}} take his guardians to court {{and because he was}} of [...] "delicate physique" [...] and couldn't receive gymnastic {{education}} which was customary. In Parallel Lives Plutarch states that Demosthenes built an underground study where he practiced speaking and shaving one half of his <b>head</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could not go out in public. Plutarch also states that he had “an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation” that he got rid of by speaking with pebbles in his mouth and by repeating verses when running or out of breath. He also practiced speaking in front of a large mirror.|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your <b>head</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Great Dish (also {{known as}} the Oceanus Dish or as the Neptune Dish, {{from the face of}} a sea-god at its centre), which {{measures}} 605mm in diameter and weighs 8256 g, is the outstanding piece. [...] The decoration, which was worked by chasing from the front, is in three concentric zones. [...] In the centre, the head of a marine deity, probably Oceanus, the personification of the ocean, is shown full-face, with a beard made of seaweed and dolphins emerging from his hair. [...] This portrait is surrounded by a narrow inner frieze of decoration populated by nereids (sea-nymphs), tritons and other mythical and natural sea-creatures, while the deep outermost zone carries imagery of the Bacchic thiasos, the dancing, music-making and drinking revels of the god Bacchus. More specifically, the triumph of Bacchus over Hercules is depicted. [...] Hercules is shown staggering drunkenly and supported by two helpful satyrs. Bacchus himself appears with his panther and Silenus at the '12 o'clock' position on the circle in relation to the orientation of the Oceanus <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> in most illustrations of the dish, he is seen upside-down {{at the top of the}} picture. The god Pan also appears in the composition, dancing and brandishing his pan-pipes, as do several dancing Maenads, the female devotees of Bacchus, and satyrs. [...] The entire design is traditionally pagan, and is superbly executed.|$|E
50|$|Sel-Sync or Selective Synchronous {{recording}} is {{the process}} of selectively using audio tape record heads as play back <b>heads</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> new signals can be recorded on other tracks in perfect sync with the existing tracks.
