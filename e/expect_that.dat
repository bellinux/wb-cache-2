5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the {{discovery}} of Planet Nine would aid in understanding the processes behind {{the formation of the}} Solar System and other planetary systems, as well as how unusual the Solar System is, with a lack of planets with masses between that of Earth and that of Neptune, compared to other planetary systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E

5|$|The comet {{continued}} to fade as it receded, {{but is still}} being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
5|$|The few impact craters on Triton {{are almost}} all {{concentrated}} in the leading hemisphere—that facing {{the direction of the}} orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent. Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

By identifying these types of “driver” indicators, {{it may be possible to}} simplify the assessment task. Lastly, we <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> with a rather small number of indicators it would be possible to conduct a SIA, capable of giving reliable, understandable and comprehensive results of sustainability of the forest-based bioeconomy in Finland.|$|R

I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|Brandon {{invites the}} Dashwoods and the Middletons {{to a party}} on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby {{requests}} a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and {{he may not be}} able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used}} to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> there are more cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, {{and one of the}} coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
