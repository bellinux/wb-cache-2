60|$|The prize {{proved to}} be the full-rigged ship Portobello--Captain Hardy, master--bound from London to Kingston in Jamaica, with a cargo of cotton goods and <b>hoop-iron.</b>|$|E
60|$|Six of us youngsters {{were treated}} in this way; then the lather was scraped {{off with a}} piece of old <b>hoop-iron,</b> and, after being thus shaved, buckets of cold water were thrown over us.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "hard stuff" [...] {{referred}} to was <b>hoop-iron,</b> which, {{as well as}} nails and a few hatchets, the Eskimos of the eastern parts of the Arctic shores obtained from whale-ships and passed on to their friends in the more remote regions of the farther north.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{answer for}} the {{toughness}} of the handle, at any rate!" [...] cried Peterkin; [...] "my arms are nearly {{pulled out of}} the sockets. But see here, our luck is great. There is iron on the blade." [...] He pointed to a piece of <b>hoop-iron</b> as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of the oar to prevent it from splitting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} {{appropriate}} the bow {{for my own}} use," [...] said Jack, chipping the piece of wood he had brought with his axe. [...] "I {{used to be a}} pretty fair shot once.--But what's that you're doing?" [...] he added, looking at Peterkin, who had drawn {{the end of a long}} pole into the tent, and was endeavouring to fit a small piece of the <b>hoop-iron</b> to the end of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps we {{can find}} {{something}} to cut it up," [...] Jack said, getting up and turning over the litter {{on the floor with}} his foot. For two or three minutes he searched about. [...] "Hurrah!" [...] he exclaimed at last, [...] "here is a bit of old <b>hoop-iron</b> that will do first-rate. It is not stiff enough to cut with, but I think we can saw with it, if one takes hold of each end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] said Peterkin, exchanging the axe for his <b>hoop-iron</b> knife, {{with which}} he cut off the desired portion. [...] "I'm only too glad, my dear boy, to see that your {{appetite}} is so wholesale, and there's no chance whatever of its dwindling down into re-tail again--at least, {{in so far as}} this pig is concerned.--Ralph, lad, why don't you laugh, eh?" [...] he added, turning suddenly to me with a severe look of inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a beastly funny {{time of it}} I had, diving out shell, fishing beche-de-mer, trading <b>hoop-iron</b> and hatchets for copra and ivory- nuts, running niggers and all {{the rest}} of it. Why, even in Fiji the Lotu was having a hard time of it and the chiefs still eating long-pig. To the westward it was fierce--funny little black kinky- heads, man-eaters the last Jack of them, and the jackpot fat and {{spilling}} over with wealth--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wyllard laughed. [...] "I sat {{upon the}} {{steerage}} ladder, and am afraid I cheered the combatants on. It {{was really a}} glorious row. They hammered each other with tin plates, {{and some of them}} tried to use <b>hoop-iron</b> knives, which fortunately doubled up. They broke quite a few of the benches, and wrecked the mess table, but so far as I noticed the only one seriously hurt was a little chap who was quietly looking on." ...|$|E
60|$|During this time, however, we had {{not been}} {{altogether}} idle. We made several experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not improve it. Then we removed our goods and took up our abode in the cave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower. Besides this, we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal--at least Jack and Peterkin did; I listened. Among other useful things, Jack, who was ever the most active and diligent, converted about three inches of the <b>hoop-iron</b> into an excellent knife. First, he beat it quite flat with the axe; then he made a rude handle, and tied the <b>hoop-iron</b> to it with our piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge {{on a piece of}} sandstone. When it was finished he used it to shape a better handle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief--in which operation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord Nelson's noses. However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by Peterkin as a fishing-line. He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end of it. This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled quickly ashore. But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the fish we caught were exceedingly small.|$|E
60|$|Knowing as he {{did from}} rumour that Eskimos from the Moravian {{settlements}} were {{in the habit of}} travelling northward for the purposes of barter, (though they had not up to that time travelled so far north as his own tribe), and observing bundles of <b>hoop-iron</b> on the sledges, it did not require much penetration {{on the part of a}} quick mind like that of Ujarak to guess whence the strangers had come, and what their object was. Nevertheless, the leader and most of the party who had circled round the wizard and his sledge, opened their eyes in amazement at this smart statement of their affairs.|$|E
60|$|Arrived {{at the old}} village, these {{lively and}} {{energetic}} nomads occupied themselves during the brief remainder of winter and the early spring in securely hiding the goods of which they had become possessed, excepting such light portions as they meant to carry along with them to their summer retreat. Among these {{were a number of}} bows, spears, and arrows made from the wood of the burnt vessel, with cleverly adapted iron heads, filed to fine sharp points, and burnished until they glittered in the light. Of knives and axes there were also sufficient to equip most of the young men, and those, for whom there were none, made to themselves pretty good knives out of pieces of <b>hoop-iron.</b>|$|E
6000|$|For {{many days}} after this, Jack applied himself with unremitting assiduity to the {{construction}} of our boat, which at length began to look something like one. But those only who have had the thing to do can entertain a right idea of the difficulty involved in such an undertaking, with no other implements than an axe, a bit of <b>hoop-iron,</b> a sail-needle, and a broken penknife. But Jack did it. He was of that disposition which will not be conquered. When he believed himself to be acting rightly, he overcame all obstacles. I have seen Jack, when doubtful whether what he was about to do were right or wrong, as timid and vacillating as a little girl; and I honour him for it! ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the first}} {{excitement}} of arrival was over, the Eskimos built igloes {{on the shore}} and settled down to dismantle the vessel and take possession of her stores, and of all that could be of use to them. They built an elongated oval igloe on the shore as a store to receive the lighter and, as they esteemed them, more valuable articles. Among these were included all the axes, <b>hoop-iron,</b> and other pieces of manageable metal that could be easily carried. There were also numbers of tin cans, iron pots, cups, glass tumblers, earthenware plates, and other things of the kind, which were esteemed a most valuable possession by people whose ordinary domestic furniture consisted chiefly of seal-skin bowls and shallow stone dishes.|$|E
60|$|Bassett had pricked up {{his ears}} at the {{suggestion}} {{that it was a}} white man's head; for he had long since come to accept that these jungle-dwellers, in the midmost centre of the great island, had never had intercourse with white men. Certainly he had found them without the almost universal beche-de-mer English of the west South Pacific. Nor had they knowledge of tobacco, nor of gunpowder. Their few precious knives, made from lengths of <b>hoop-iron,</b> and their few and more precious tomahawks from cheap trade hatchets, he had surmised they had captured in war from the bushmen of the jungle beyond the grass lands, and that they, in turn, had similarly gained them from the salt-water men who fringed the coral beaches of the shore and had contact with the occasional white men.|$|E
60|$|Now this girl--Aneetka by name--was by {{no means}} an angel in Esquimau habiliments. Among civilised folk {{probably}} {{she would not have}} been deemed even pretty. Nevertheless, in the eyes of her lover she was most decidedly beautiful, and round, and fat, and rosy, and young, awkward, and comfortable! And the giant loved her--never so strongly, perhaps, as when he saw her striving to allay the fears of her old grandfather. But this same grandfather was obstinate. He wanted her to become the wife of an Esquimau who lived far to the westward, and who once had dealings with the fur-traders, and from whom he expected to derive considerable advantages and gifts of bits of <b>hoop-iron</b> and nails. But she wanted to become the giant's wife; so there the matter stood.|$|E
60|$|He told of {{the faith}} that never deserted him even when he hung on the ragged edge of despair the faith that comes of knowing men and things. He enlarged, {{as though he were}} talking to himself, on his very great courage and {{resource}} at all times. The thing was so evident in the man's mind that he never even changed his tone. He described how he had bested his enemies, or forgiven them, exactly as they had bested or forgiven him in those careless days; how he had entreated, cajoled, and bullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for their enduring good; crawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines, dragging a string and <b>hoop-iron</b> railroad after him, and in the end, how he had sat still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his character to shreds.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach," [...] said he; [...] "but {{they are}} of no use at all without a steel. However, we must try." [...] So saying, {{he went to the}} beach, and soon {{returned}} with two flints. On one of these he placed the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; but it was with great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the flints, and the tinder, being a bad, hard piece, would not catch. He then tried the bit of <b>hoop-iron,</b> which would not strike fire at all; and after that the back of the axe, with no better success. During all these trials Peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets, gazing with a most melancholy visage at our comrade, his face growing longer and more miserable at each successive failure.|$|E
6000|$|He leaned far {{over the}} table, till his very {{breast-bone}} {{was over the}} edge, as though his eyes had been stilettos {{and he wanted to}} drive them home into my brain. It was only much later that I understood how near death I had been at that moment. But the knives on the tablecloth were the usual restaurant knives with rounded ends and about as deadly as pieces of <b>hoop-iron.</b> Perhaps in the very gust of his fury he remembered what a French restaurant knife is like and something sane within him made him give up the sudden project of cutting my heart out where I sat. For it could have been nothing but a sudden impulse. His settled purpose was quite other. It was not my heart that he was after. His fingers indeed were groping amongst the knife handles by the side of his plate but what captivated my attention for a moment were his red lips which were formed into an odd, sly, insinuating smile. Heard! To be sure he had heard! The chief of the great arms smuggling organization! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{five minutes}} the party were far {{on their way}} back to the ship; and in less than five hours after the Esquimaux had closed their barter, and left for their village, four of their number, {{including}} the baby, were close prisoners in the Dolphin's hold. It was not Captain Guy's intention, however, to use unnecessarily harsh means for the recovery of the missing articles. His object was to impress the Esquimaux with a salutary sense of the power, promptitude, and courage of Europeans, and to check at the outset their propensity for thieving. Having succeeded in making two of their chief men prisoners, he felt assured that the lost telescope and hatchet would soon make their appearance; and in this he was not mistaken. Going to the hold, where the prisoners sat with downcast looks, he addressed to them a lengthened speech as to the sin and meanness of stealing in general, and of stealing from those who had been kind to them in particular. He explained to them the utter hopelessness of their attempting to deceive or impose upon the white men in any way whatever, and assured them that if they tried that sort of thing again he would punish them severely; but that if they behaved well, and brought plenty of walrus flesh to the ship, he would give them <b>hoop-iron,</b> beads, looking-glasses, etcetera. These remarks seemed to make a considerable impression on his uncouth hearers.|$|E
60|$|Royal in courage was he, {{this moment}} on the Arangi, {{despite the fact that}} he knew he walked on {{dynamite}}. As he had long since bitterly learned, any white man was as much dynamite as was the mysterious death- dealing missile he sometimes employed. When a stripling, he had made one of the canoe force that attacked the sandalwood-cutter that had been even smaller than the Arangi. He had never forgotten that mystery. Two of the three white men he had seen slain and their heads removed on deck. The third, still fighting, had but the minute before fled below. Then the cutter, along with all her wealth of <b>hoop-iron,</b> tobacco, knives and calico, had gone up into the air and fallen back into the sea in scattered and fragmented nothingness. It had been dynamite--the MYSTERY. And he, who had been hurled uninjured through the air by a miracle of fortune, had divined that white men in themselves were truly dynamite, compounded of the same mystery as the substance with which they shot the swift-darting schools of mullet, or blow up, in extremity, themselves and the ships on which they voyaged the sea from far places. And yet on this unstable and death-terrific substance of which he was well aware Van Horn was composed, he trod heavily with his personality, daring, to the verge of detonation, to impact it with his insolence.|$|E
6000|$|... "The amazement of our {{visitors}} is very great. Myouk, {{his wife}} and baby, and his son Meetek, are now our guests. When they first came in sight of the brig they uttered a wild shout--the men did so, at least--and tossed their arms and opened their eyes and mouths. They have never shut them since. They go all round the vessel, staring and gaping with amazement. We have given them a number of useful presents, and intend to send them home loaded with gifts for their friends. It is necessary {{to make a good}} impression on them. Our lives depend very much on the friendship of these poor people. We find that they are terrible thieves. A number of knives and a hatchet were missed--they were found hidden in Myouk's sledge. We tried to prevail on Oomia to sell her long boots. To our surprise she was quite willing to part with one, but nothing would induce her to give up the other. One of the men observed her steal a knife out of the cabin and hide it in the leg of her boot. The reason was now plain. We pulled off the boot without asking leave, and found there a large assortment of articles stolen from us. Two or three knives, a spoon, a bit of <b>hoop-iron,</b> and a marline spike. I have tried to make them understand, by signs, that this is very wicked conduct, but they only laugh at me. They are not in the least ashamed, and evidently regard stealing as no sin.|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} {{mentioned}} the chestnut-tree with its wonderful buttresses or planks. This tree, then, furnished {{us with the}} chief part of our material. First of all, Jack sought out a limb of a tree of such a form and size as, while it should form the keel, a bend at either end should form the stem and stern-posts. Such a piece, however, {{was not easy to}} obtain; but at last he procured it by rooting up a small tree which had a branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem, with two strong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to make a flat-sterned boat. This placed, he procured three branching roots of suitable size, which he fitted to the keel at equal distances, thus forming three strong ribs. Now the squaring and shaping of these, and the cutting of the grooves in the keel, was an easy enough matter, as it was all work for the axe, in the use of which Jack was become wonderfully expert; but it was quite a different affair when he came to nailing the ribs to the keel, for we had no instrument capable of boring a large hole, and no nails to fasten them with. We were, indeed, much perplexed here; but Jack at length devised an instrument that served very well. He took the remainder of our <b>hoop-iron</b> and beat it into the form of a pipe or cylinder, about as thick as a man's finger. This he did by means of our axe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house of the poor man at {{the other side of the}} island. This, when made red hot, bored slowly through the timbers; and the better to retain the heat, Jack shut up one end of it and filled it with sand. True, the work was very slowly done; but it mattered not--we had little else to do. Two holes were bored in each timber, about an inch and a half apart, and also down into the keel, but not quite through. Into these were placed stout pegs made of a tree called iron-wood, and when they were hammered well home, the timbers were as firmly fixed as if they had been nailed with iron. The gunwales, which were very stout, were fixed in a similar manner. But besides the wooden nails, they were firmly lashed to the stem and stern-posts and ribs by means of a species of cordage which we had contrived to make out of the fibrous husk of the cocoa-nut. This husk was very tough, and when a number of the threads were joined together they formed excellent cordage. At first we tied the different lengths together; but this was such a clumsy and awkward complication of knots that we contrived, by careful interlacing of the ends together before twisting, to make good cordage of any size or length we chose. Of course it cost us much time and infinite labour; but Jack kept up our spirits when we grew weary, and so all that we required was at last constructed.|$|E

5000|$|Early gabions were round cages {{with open}} tops and bottoms, made from {{wickerwork}} {{and filled with}} earth for use as military fortifications. These early military gabions were most often used to protect sappers and siege artillery gunners. [...] The wickerwork cylinders were light and could be carried relatively conveniently in the ammunition train, particularly if they were made in several diameters to fit one inside another. At the site of use in the field, they could be stood on end, staked in position, and filled with soil to form an effective wall around the gun, or rapidly construct a bulletproof parapet along a sap. During the Crimean War, local shortages of brushwood led to use of scrap <b>hoop-iron</b> from hay bales in its stead; this in turn led to purpose-built sheet-iron gabions.|$|E
40|$|This {{notation}} {{was originally}} published by Cecil Sharp in 19121. Beadnell {{is a small}} village situated on the north-east coast of Northumberland, a few {{miles south of the}} Farne Islands, and about fifty miles north of Newcastle-on-Tyne. The sword-dance is annually performed there by fishermen on New Year’s Day. The dancers, five in number, are accompanied by two Bessies and a musician with an accordion. COSTUME The dancers are dressed in blue jerseys and navy blue cloth trousers, and wear, over one shoulder and breast, single baldrics or sashes of pink silk or sateen, four or five inches wide, upon which several large rosettes of different colours are sewn. They dance bareheaded. Each dancer carries a flexible sword or rapper, made of <b>hoop-iron,</b> similar to, but rather longer than, those used by the Swalwell and Earsdon sword-dancers, and without a revolving handle, blocks of wood being fastened on the upper and lower surfaces of each extremity. The two Bessies are impersonated by men dressed in women’s clothes, one of them carrying a red sunshade. The musician is dressed in his ordinary clothes. THE MUSIC There is no special tune traditionally associated with the dance; the musician may choose any dance air in 6 / 8 time that he thinks suitable. THE STEP Ordinarily the dancers walk or tramp in time with the music, two steps to the bar, but at certain points in the dance, as hereinafter directed, they &quot;step &quot; in the way described in the Grenoside 2 dance. THE DANCE The dance consists of five Figures. As in the Swalwell 3 and Earsdon 4 dances, the movements are continuous, no pause being made between the several evolutions. The locking of the Nut must be completed {{at the end of one}} or other strain of the air...|$|E
