50|$|Brittney Cooper, {{who teaches}} a seminar about hip-hop {{feminism}} at Rutgers University, believes, along with Aisha Durham and Susana M.

To them, Hip-Hop feminists must insist that women and girls of color remain central to analyses, {{particularly in light of}} critical gender approaches that treat black women as an addendum to <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> black women have honed, effectively relegating them to the sidelines of a stage they built. Within hip-hop feminist studies, hip-hop and feminism act as discrete but constitutive categories that share a dialogic relationship. They see hip-hop feminism as a generationally specific articulation of feminist consciousness, epistemology, and politics rooted in the pioneering work of multiple generations of black feminists based in the United States and elsewhere in the diaspora but focused on questions and issues that grow out of the aesthetic and political prerogatives of hip-hop culture. Thus, Hip-hop feminism is concerned with the ways the conservative backlash of the 1980s and 1990s, deindustrialization, the slashing of the welfare state, and the attendant gutting of social programs and affirmative action, along with the increasing racial wealth gap, have affected the life-worlds and worldviews of the hip-hop generation.|$|R

40|$|What {{strategies}} do migrants {{living in}} European cities use to challenge inequalities in access to healthcare, {{participation in the}} labor market and the creation of social support networks? The papers in this panel aim to respond to this question by drawing from transnational and <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> conceptualizing inequalities as sets of relationships between people and broader structures in which interactions generate better opportunity for some more than for others (Tilly, 2000). Panel participants consider that these interactions and the benefits that can be obtained through migration are affected by various social categories such as gender, class, sexual identity, transnational connections, and citizenship. <b>Intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> allow to examine how these axes of inequality (Crenshaw, 1989; Anthias, 2001) simultaneously affect migration outcomes and also how they operate differently according to the geographical space in which they develop: origin and host societies as well as transnationally. Nonetheless, the papers presented in this panel will also emphasize migrants’ agency to resist or conform to the inequalities they face. Overall, this panel aims to contribute to the study of migration and inequality at the conceptual and methodological levels. At the theoretical level, the panel will build on new debates on the reproduction of intersectional inequalities in transnational settings (Faist, 2016, Amelina, 2017). At the methodological level, all paper presenters have use multi-sited ethnographic methods (working in cities such as Madrid, London, Milan, Brussels and Frankfurt) and will therefore use the panel as an opportunity to discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such method.

Using survey data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we speak to current debates concerning potential relationships between religion, nonreligion and health in older adult populations with two key findings. First, we show no consistent relationships between religion or nonreligion and chronic condition prevalence. Second, we demonstrate race, sex, and class variations within nonreligious people’s health outcomes consistent with patterns noted in previous analyses of religious populations. In conclusion, we draw out implications for future research concerning the importance of (1) using caution when interpreting correlations between religion (i. e., a privileged social location) and health; (2) developing <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> to religion, nonreligion, and health; and (3) building a diverse base of scholarship concerning nonreligion and health...|$|R

The thesis concludes that recognizing and fostering a multiplicity of masculinities and forms of fatherhood may be a positive change in the direction of dissolving social hierarchies...|$|R

Conversion of progenitor fate restriction signals to constitutive recombinase expression enables viral targeting of cell types based on their lineage and birth time.

50|$|Studies of the {{experiences}} of transgender people of color are often based on the theories of intersectionality and privilege. <b>Intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> argue that the overlapping racial and gender identities of transgender people of color results in them experiencing even more oppression and discrimination. Therefore, transgender advocacy should give special attention to non-white individuals. In this context, the theory of privilege asserts that both white transgender individuals and cisgender people of color receive certain benefits because of their skin color or gender identity, while those who are both non-white and non-heterosexual are deprived of these benefits and face additional oppression. For example, {{according to a report}} by National LGBTQ Task Force, Asian transgender individuals were more likely than their cisgender counterparts to report experiencing racism within the LGBT community. This aligns with matrix of domination theory, which argues that sociological factors such as race and gender overlap and increase the degree of discrimination experienced by minority individuals.|$|R

50|$|EGM note 35 Experts {{were finally}} keen to emphasise that - {{even within the}} same {{geographic}} or socio-political setting, ‘context’ {{was not the same}} thing for different women and girls. Women and girls often experience multiple and intersecting forms of social disadvantage and discrimination (in addition to that based on gender), and this compounds their individual and collective vulnerability to violence. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, has recently noted that theories on violence have often ‘failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various forms of discrimination, beyond a male/female gender binary, contextualize, exacerbate, and correlate to high levels of violence in given societies. The lack of an <b>intersectional</b> <b>approach</b> can lead to the reinforcing of one form of discrimination in attempts to alleviate another.’ Factors such as race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, geographic location, disability, HIV status or status as a refugee or internally displaced person, will all influence the forms and nature of violence women and girls may suffer, and the relationship of these factors to prevention is discussed in the ‘Key Findings’ section.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the idea of embodiment, of occupying the body, as Berne states, one must have an understanding of the body as situated within a historical, political, cultural, and social context. Feminist disability studies scholar Rosemarie Garland-Thomson argues that, [...] "integrating disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands, and challenges feminist theory". She is, essentially, arguing for a more <b>intersectional</b> <b>approach</b> to both fields, allowing conversation across coalitions and co-opting of messages and theories. For Garland-Thomson, the [...] "shared human experience of embodiment" [...] provides a framework in which all individuals should be able to understand the way systems affect or do not affect them based on their bodies. The sharing of experience should, theoretically, make difference more palatable in interpersonal relationships. In the documentary, however, one of the performances includes narration that says, [...] "We labor to shield you from our differences…We live in continual risk." [...] People with disabilities, both visible and invisible, live with a higher risk of experiencing violence and an extreme amount of pressure to conform. The more identities intersect with one another, the more complicated it becomes to navigate spaces that are unwelcoming or biased. Sins Invalid aims to address this difficulty through creating a performance space that is inviting to all identities.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{the case}} of Andean {{transnational}} families’ access to formal healthcare provided an illustration of the added value of our analytical approach. Beyond the study of access to healthcare {{in a context of}} South-North migration, combining transnational and <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> seem equally relevant for other types of migratory regimes (e.g. high-skilled migration and EU mobility) and for different areas of social protection than health (e.g. pensions and education). This contribution, therefore, contributed to consolidate transnational studies as an actual theory of society rather than just a mere description of networks that cross multiple nation states (Glick-Schiller, 2005, p. 439). At the same time, it also modestly contributed to increasing the explanatory power of intersectionality in a world of increasing human mobility (Mahler et al., 2015, Freznoza-Flot & Shinozaki, 2017, Anthias, 2008, Purkayastha, 2010). However, we are also firmly convinced that further research combining intersectional and transnational analytical lenses is needed to refine our understanding of immigrants’ access to social protection and, more generally, identify new types of inequalities that affect migrants and non-migrants alike.|$|R
40|$|This article investigates how the {{concepts}} of ‘mainstreaming’ and ‘misfitting’ become useful analytical tools for analyzing visual media representations of disability. The analysis deals with two videos from online awareness-raising campaigns about disability, and {{the aim is to}} show that disability intersects with gender in ways that have significant consequences for how bodily expressions are negotiated. Media representations of both disability and gender have become more visible but are rarely studied together. When they are, it is rarely from a vantage point in disability experience. Therefore, I stress the importance of applying <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> specifically to disability and suggest a methodological framework composed of two contrasting movements: mainstreaming (as a reference point of striving for normalization in visual media representation) as opposed to misfitting (as a critical position that applies to disability and its intersection with gender). The analyses of the videos show how these positions are at play through sometimes very subtle capacities in which gender interferes with the processes of mainstreaming and stabilizing disability, or attempts are made to accommodate misfit positions by challenging and transgressing traditional notions of disabled and gendered embodiment...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} highlights the importance of gendered social determinants of child health, such as maternal education and women's status, for mediating child survival. This narrative review of evidence from diverse low and middle-income contexts (covering the period 1970 –May 2012) examines the significance of intra-household bargaining power and process as gendered dimensions of child health and nutrition. The findings focus on two main elements of bargaining: the role of women's decision-making power and access to and control over resources; and the importance of household headship, structure and composition. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in the light of lifecycle and <b>intersectional</b> <b>approaches</b> to gender and health. The relative lack of published intervention studies that explicitly consider gendered intra-household bargaining is highlighted. Given the complex mechanisms through which intra-household bargaining shapes child health and nutrition it is critical that efforts to address gender in health and nutrition programming are thoroughly documented and widely shared to promote further learning and action. There is scope to develop links between gender equity initiatives in areas of adult and adolescent health, and child health and nutrition programming. Child health and nutrition interventions will be more effective, equitable and sustainable if they are designed based on gender-sensitive information and continually evaluated from a gender perspective...|$|R
