The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

The contributors therefore consider first general Convention and Human Rights Act concepts – statutory interpretation, horizontal effect, <b>judicial</b> review, <b>deference,</b> the reception of Strasbourg case-law – since they arise across all areas of substantive law.

5000|$|The Supreme Court of the mid‑1920s was {{primarily}} concerned with the relationships of business and government. A majority of the justices led by Taft were staunch defenders of business and capitalism from most government regulation. The Court utilized the doctrines of substantive due process and the new (not new - see {{as far back as}} Dr Bonham's case in the early 1600s - and see the 14tn Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, although freedom of contract, freedom of voluntary association, has been a fundamental principle of the Common Law for centuries) fundamental right of [...] "liberty of contract" [...] to oversee attempts at regulation by the national and state governments.

We argue that in such cases, Judge Cudahy 2 ̆ 7 s decisions point towards a principle of favoring the outcome that best supports the system-wide welfare of the electric grid.

However, judicial respect for and application of the principle of federalism in family law has not been consistent, especially in recent decades. In many decisions during the past thirty years, federal courts (especially) have simply ignored the principle of federalism in family law, and the <b>judicial</b> doctrine of <b>deference</b> to federalism in family law seems to have eroded significantly.

40|$|This article {{considers}} how {{courts have}} responded to the inclusion of six innovative rules in the Restatement (Second) of the Law of Contracts. It observes that most courts simply have deferred to the new rules. In the vast majority of cases, courts gave no reasons for their decisions to embrace the six rules. They simply cited them as they would cite a statute or code and did not question their authority. This practice raises an important normative question: Should courts follow the Restatement (Second) as readily as they currently do? The article concludes that, although some arguments counsel against deference to an academic work such as the Restatement (Second), on balance, the practice does more good than harm. By deferring to the Restatement (Second), courts have tended to promote uniformity and certainty in the law of contracts and to conserve <b>judicial</b> resources. Although <b>deference</b> to the Restatement (Second) may alter the substance of the law in some jurisdictions, such changes generally do not have deleterious consequences...|$|R

40|$|The last {{installment}} of this column inaugurated a multi-installment project examining <b>judicial</b> doctrines of <b>deference</b> to interpretations and positions taken {{by state and}} local tax agencies. We noted that in the various states, these doctrines fall into about a half dozen categories. This installment explores one of those categories. A major deference rule in federal administrative law (including tax law) emanates from the U. S. Supreme Court’s famous Chevron case. This installment considers {{the extent to which}} Chevron and similar approaches are applied in state and local tax cases. The first part be low briefly describes Chevron. State versions or equivalents come in three forms: (1) some state-local decisions expressly adopt or cite Chevron; (2) some other state-local decisions do not refer to Chevron by name but apply standards that are essentially indistinguishable from Chevron; and (3) yet other state-local decisions accord “great” deference to agency decisions without further articulation. In practice, this third version works out largely the same way that Chevron does. The second, third, and fourth parts of this article describe those three versions and give examples of their application in state and local tax cases. Finally, the last part addresses ways in which taxpayers may effectively challenge tax agency determinations in those jurisdictions that follow Chevron or Chevron-like doctrines...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the Supreme Court has resurrected an {{intermediate}} deference standard from the 1940 s to be applied by courts in considering informal guidance issued by administrative agencies. The decision upon which the deference standard is based {{is a product of}} a political solution and not a comprehensive evaluation of how the New Deal agencies fit within traditional role of the courts as sole interpreters of the law. This 1940 s decision has evolved such that deference to the views of administrative agencies has become a matter of <b>judicial</b> discretion, finding <b>deference</b> when the views of an agency parallel the views of a court and finding that deference is unnecessary when its views differ from those of an agency, permitting the substitution of its judgment for that of an agency with expertise in the area. Statutory schemes, however, have become increasingly complex with competing policy interests. When dealing with multifaceted, competing policy interests, administrative agencies can consider a particular issue {{in the context of the}} statutory scheme while courts consider a particular issue in the context of the precise issue originating in litigation. Courts have much less familiarity with complex statutory schemes with only infrequent ability to understand the intricacies of a specific aspect of that scheme as may arise through litigation. Agencies, on the other hand, are focused on the resolution of specific issues, but in the context of its impact on an entire statutory scheme because the responsibility of an agency is to administer and enforce a statutory scheme over which it contributes substantial expertise. Agencies make policy choices and courts make decisions. Those decisions should respect the policy choices considered by agencies in their capacity as experts in a specialized area of law. The manner in which those policy choices are respected is through a meaningful deference standard to agency interpretations...|$|R
