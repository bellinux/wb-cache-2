40|$|Fifty-eight scalp biopsies were immunohistologically {{investigated}} with monoclonal antibodies against HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and T 6 antigens. The following 3 {{groups were}} compared: (i) control biopsies obtained from healthy volunteers (n = 5) or patients with unrelated scalp diseases (n = 6); (ii) biopsies from untreated alopecia areata (AA), obtained either from untreated patients (n = 19) {{or from the}} untreated side in patients receiving unilateral treatment with the contact allergen diphencyprone (DCP) (n = 13); (iii) biopsies obtained from the treated side in patients receiving unilateral treatment with DCP (n = 13). While HLA-ABC antigens were strongly expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and the infundibular epithelium of hair follicles in all biopsies, these antigens were either not detectable or only faintly expressed on the subinfundibular epithelium and the <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> in the control series. By contrast, 30 out of 32 biopsies from untreated AA showed expression of HLA-ABC antigens on <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> epithelium, and the subinfundibular epithelium was HLA-ABC-positive in 15 out of 32 cases. In the biopsies from treated AA, HLA-ABC antigens were expressed on <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> epithelium in 9 out of 13 cases, and on the subinfundibular epithelium in 1 case. In the controls and untreated AA, HLA-DR expression was confined to dendritic cells in the epidermis and tile follicular infundibulum. Its expression on <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> epithelium was found in 15 out of 32 biopsies from untreated AA and in 4 out of 13 biopsies from treated AA.

The study was done in department of pathology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Nepal. Results: A total of 21 cases of pilomatricoma were reported with age range of 9 - 53 years (mean age 23. 7) and male female ratio of 1 : 1. 1. The most common site of occurrence was neck and preauricular region. The size of the tumour ranged from 0. 3 to 4. 7 cm with a mean of 1. 2 cm.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The skin is {{responsible}} for forming a variety of epidermal structures that differ amongst vertebrates. In each case the specific structure (for example scale, feather or hair) arises from an epidermal placode {{as a result of}} epithelial–mesenchymal interactions with the underlying dermal mesenchyme. Expression of members of the Wnt, Hedgehog and bone morphogenetic protein families (Wnt 10 b, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Bmp 2 /Bmp 4, respectively) in the epidermis correlates with the initiation of hair follicle formation. Further, their expression continues into either the epidermally derived <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> which forms the hair itself, or the dermal papilla which {{is responsible}} for induction of the <b>hair</b> <b>matrix.</b> To address the role of Shh in the hair follicle, we have examined Shh null mutant mice. Results: We found that follicle development in the Shh mutant embryo arrested after the initial epidermal–dermal interactions that lead to the formation of a dermal papilla anlage and ingrowth of the epidermis. Wnt 10 b, Bmp 2 and Bmp 4 continued to be expressed at this time, however. When grafted to nude mice (which lack T cells), Shh mutant skin gave rise to large abnormal follicles containing a small dermal papilla. Although these follicles showed high rates of proliferation and some differentiation of <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> cells into hair-shaft-like material, no hair was formed. Conclusions: Shh signaling is not required for initiating hair follicle development. Shh signaling is essential, however, for controlling ingrowth and morphogenesis of the hair follicle...|$|E
40|$|The plucked hairs and biopsied hair follicles of {{the scalp}} were {{obtained}} from a female patient with monilethrix. By scanning electron microscopy, the plucked hairs showed a typical moniliform feature composed of alternated nodes and inter- nodes. By computer stereography, reconstructed three-dimensional models of in vivo hair structures showed that the diameter of hair shaft was partially reduced in the keratogenous zone and that the reduction was severe in the hair cortex and cuticle layers but mild in the inner root sheath. By transmission electron microscopy, a significant degeneration of <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> cells was found, and a zig-zag disarray of cortical tonofibrils and invaginations of the hair cuticle cells into the cortex were noticed in the suprabulbar portion. In some hairs, the hair bulbs showed no degeneration, but a degeneration of cortical cells and invaginations of hair cuticle were seen in some portions in the developing zone of the cortex. This suggests that not every <b>hair</b> <b>matrix</b> is damaged in a synchronized fashion, but individual hairs are affected independently. Furthermore, in all the hair and hair follicles examined, cytoplasmic vacuolations were always seen in the various layers, and abnormal formation of tonofibrils was often observed in the cortex.

40|$|We {{screened}} {{a series}} of antibodies for their exclusive binding to the human hair follicle bulge. In a second step these antibodies were {{to be used to}} identify basal keratinocytes and potential epithelial stem cells in the human epidermis and in engineered skin substitutes. Of all the antibodies screened, we identified only one, designated C 8 / 144 B, that exclusively recognized the hair follicle bulge. However, C 8 / 144 B-binding cells were never detected in the human epidermal stratum basale. In the bulge C 8 / 144 B-binding cells gave rise to cytokeratin 19 -positive cells, which were also tracked in the outer root sheath between bulge and the <b>hair</b> follicle <b>matrix.</b> Remarkably, cytokeratin 19 -expressing cells were never detected in the hair follicle infundibulum. Yet, cytokeratin 19 -expressing keratinocytes were found in the epidermal stratum basale of normal skin as a subpopulation of cytokeratin 15 -positive (not C 8 / 144 B-positive) basal keratinocytes. Cytokeratin 19 /cytokeratin 15 -positive keratinocytes decreased significantly with age. We suggest that cytokeratin 19 -expressing cells represent a subpopulation of basal keratinocytes in neonates and young children (up to 1. 5 years) that is particularly adapted to the lateral expansion of growing skin.

40|$|Different {{parts of}} the skin respond to {{ionizing}} radiation with different sensitivities. To examine the mechanisms underlying these different responses, we investigated various cellular parameters in the skin after exposure of mice to 5 Gy of ionizing radiation. Epidermal cells responded to radiation by undergoing growth arrest, whereas the cells in the <b>matrix</b> of <b>hair</b> follicles underwent apoptosis but not growth arrest. These distinct responses correlated with differential increases in p 53 and p 21 proteins in these two populations of cells; whereas an increase in p 53 protein levels was observed in both epidermis and <b>hair</b> follicular <b>matrix,</b> especially in the latter, the induction of p 21 was strong in the epidermis but absent in the follicular matrical cells. Studies using p 53 -null and p 21 -null mice demonstrated that the radiation-induced apoptosis in the hair follicles was fully dependent on p 53, and growth arrest in the epidermis was only partially dependent on p 53 but fully dependent on p 21. These results indicate that two epithelial cell types respond to radiation by different pathways that are governed {{in part by the}} differential p 53 - and p 21 -dependent responses of these cells; high-level induction of p 53 in the absence of p 21 induction led to apoptosis, whereas intermediate induction of both p 53 and p 21 led to growth arrest...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidermis}} is a self-renewing tissue which regenerates constantly. It consists {{mainly of}} keratinocytes of various degree of differentiation, from the proliferative basal layer to the terminally differentiated horny layer.

Epidermal stem cells reside in the basal layer of the epidermis, the bulge region of the hair follicle, and the germinal <b>hair</b> follicle <b>matrix.</b> Epidermal stem cells are relatively quiescent, slow-cycling cells defined by their great proliferative potential and unlimited capacity for self-renewal.
