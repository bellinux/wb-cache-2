These ringlets are set up by creating RPR stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop, per flow (a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic). RPR uses Media Access Control protocol (MAC) messages to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and <b>failed</b> <b>spans.</b> The avoidance of <b>failed</b> <b>spans</b> is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as steering and wrapping.

40|$|This article {{shows the}} {{existence}} of a class of closed bounded matrix convex sets which do not have absolute extreme points. The sets we consider are noncommutative sets, $K_X$, formed by taking matrix convex combinations of a single tuple $X$. In the case that $X$ is a tuple of compact operators with no nontrivial finite dimensional reducing subspaces, $K_X$ is a closed bounded matrix convex set with no absolute extreme points. A central goal in the theory of matrix convexity is to find a natural notion of an extreme point in the dimension free setting which is minimal with respect to spanning. Matrix extreme points are the strongest type of extreme point known to span matrix convex sets; however, they are not necessarily the smallest set which does so. Absolute extreme points, a more restricted type of extreme points that are closely related to Arveson's boundary, enjoy a strong notion of minimality should they span. This result shows that matrix convex sets may <b>fail</b> to be <b>spanned</b> by their absolute extreme points. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

In the case p = 3, this grid coloring problem is equivalent to find disjoint realizations of two degree sequences in a complete bipartite graph. This kind of question is well-studied when one of the degree sequence (or equivalently color) has span zero or one, see for instance [15], [12], [11], [13] and [3].

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} intersection and conflict of two aesthetic imperatives, one mimetic {{and the other}} didactic, in the literary culture of early eighteenth-century Germany and mid-nineteenth-century Russia. Describing a structure that I call "visionary mimesis" or "progressive realism," I show how texts struggle {{to bridge the gap}} between imitation and transformation, the present and the future, or what is and what ought to be. I present this underlying contradiction as a defining dynamic of both Enlightenment and Realist literature. First I analyze J. C. Gottsched's Critical Poetics (1729), showing how the text deploys multiple shifting understandings of literary mimesis in order to reconcile the "imitation of nature" with the demand for morally instructive portrayals. Then I examine how this conflict is worked out in a fictional text, C. M. Wieland's novel The History of Agathon (1766 - 67). After tracing Wieland's turn toward a more "earthly" aesthetic in his earliest writings, I demonstrate that his novel pushes apart the very antinomies that it ostensibly seeks to combine. I then examine how the contradictions of "visionary mimesis" are reworked in the cultural context of the " 1860 s" in Russia. I describe the strained yet wonderfully ingenious interpretations put forth by the radical realist critic N. A. Dobroliubov in his desperate attempt to find the revolutionary hero within Russian reality. I then examine how F. M. Dostoevsky pursues a religious version of the radical project. After turning to his correspondence and his Diary of a Writer for background, I show how The Brothers Karamazov (1879 - 80) creates a path from ordinary experience to spiritual transcendence. The comparative angle of the dissertation places nineteenth-century Russian literature in a broader European context. Texts of this period are often viewed as precursors of twentieth-century socialist realism; I argue that they continue an Enlightenment project and, with the German texts, belong to the larger literary configuration of "visionary mimesis. " An awareness of this configuration helps explain the complexity and instability of "progressive realist" texts. Because these texts often <b>fail</b> to <b>span</b> the contradictions of imitation and transformation, they mirror the perennial cultural gap between our objective perceptions and our subjective visions...|$|R
40|$|While {{the study}} of non-composite {{castellated}} beams have received much attention, very little {{work has been done}} on composite castellated beams. The effect of the composite concrete slab is to significantly increase the flexural resistance of a steel section; it is however uncertain what effect this will have on the shear resistance. In this research project tests to destruction of five composite castellated beams were performed, and relate to previous tests on non-composite castellated beams. Ultimate failure loads of the three shear critical test beams were associated with web-post buckling, comprising double curvature bending. The remaining two flexural test beams failed when most of the studs in one-half of the <b>span</b> <b>failed,</b> resulting in lateral torsional buckling of the suddenly unconstrained flange. A numerical study using the finite element method was then employed in investigating the nonlinear buckling behavior of the web-posts in shear critical composite and non-composite castellated beams. Buckling of the web-posts was observed to be the dominant mode of failure in all finite element models; the composite beams were found to have significantly higher ultimate shear carrying capacities than their non-composite counterparts. It was found that the effect of the composite slab is to reduce the shear force in the web-posts, thus increasing the beam ultimate shear carrying capacity. Finally, yield analyses were performed on castellated beams using moment-to-shear interaction diagrams originally developed for isolated web openings. Results based on yield failures were found to be in good agreement with the test failure loads for the flexure critical beams. Yield analysis tended to slightly overestimate the failure loads for the shear critical composite test beams, due largely to the buckling failures of the web-posts in the tests.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how three money’s worth measures â the benefit-to-tax ratio, the internal rate of return, {{and the net}} present value â are calculated and used in analyses of social security reforms, including systems with privately managed individual accounts invested in equities. Declining returns from the U. S. social security system {{prove to be the}} inevitable result of having instituted an unfunded (pay-as-you-go) retirement system that delivered $ 7. 9 trillion of net transfers (in 1997 present value dollars) to people born before 1917, and will deliver another $ 1. 8 trillion to people born between 1918 and 1937. But young and future workers cannot necessarily do better by investing their payroll taxes in capital markets. If the old system were closed down, massive unfunded liabilities of $ 9 - 10 trillion would still have to be paid unless already accrued benefits were cut. Alternative methods of calculating these accrued benefits yield somewhat different numbers: the straight line calculation is $ 800 billion less than the constant benefit calculation we propose as the benchmark. Using this benchmark in a world with no uncertainty, we show that privatization without prefunding would not increase returns at all, net of the new taxes needed to pay for unfunded liabilities. These new taxes would amount to 3. 6 percent of payroll, or about 29 percent of social security contributions. Prefunding, implemented by reducing accrued benefits or by raising taxes, would eventually increase money’s worth for later generations, but at the cost of lower money’s worth for today’s workers and/or retirees. Computing money’s worth when there is uncertainty is much more difficult unless four conditions hold, namely optimization, time homogeneity, stable prices, and spanning. Under these conditions, the diversification of social security investments into stocks and out of bonds has no effect whatsoever on money’s worth when it is properly adjusted for risk: a dollar of stock is worth no more than a dollar of bonds. When <b>spanning</b> <b>fails,</b> diversification can raise welfare for constrained households, but the exact money’s worth must depend on specific assumptions about household attitudes toward risk. Calculations like those of the Social Security Advisory Council that attribute over $ 2. 85 of net present value gain to each $ 1 shifted from bonds to stocks completely overlook the disutility of risk. By contrast, we estimate that a 2 percent of payroll equity fund carved out of social security would increase net present value by about 59 cents per dollar of bonds switched into equities, instead of $ 2. 85. When the likely reductions in income and longevity insurance are factored in, the net advantage of privatization and diversification is substantially less than popularly perceived. ...|$|R
