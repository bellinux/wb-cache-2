5|$|The regiment's {{part in the}} war was now {{effectively}} over. On 4 October they camped to the north-west of Jericho for {{the next}} four <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> then moved back to their old camp at the Mar Elias monastery, and eventually reached Richon le Zion on 14 October.|$|E

60|$|So {{they made}} haste, {{and all that}} night they journeyed beneath the moon, and all the next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> journeyed beneath the sun, and {{on the evening of}} the <b>day</b> <b>they</b> came to a city.|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} <b>day</b> <b>they</b> only {{worked for a}} quarter of an hour at a time, taking an hour's rest. The pain in their arms had begun to abate. On the {{following}} <b>day</b> <b>they</b> practised striking alternately, three standing round one borer. They found this at first awkward, but by the end of the <b>day</b> <b>they</b> were able to strike in regular order, the blows falling faster after each other on to the drill.|$|R
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in the shade. In the morning and on cool <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|Bradford played {{six games}} during December, {{with the first}} two ending in draws against Preston North End and Stockport County. On 19 December, City {{defeated}} Leicester Fosse 4–0 at Valley Parade. It was City's highest league victory {{of the season with}} McMillan scoring his side's second hat-trick of the campaign. City finished the month with three games in the space of four <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> first lost 4–1 to Woolwich Arsenal on Christmas Day, before a 1–0 victory at Blackpool. The year finished with a draw against Port Vale.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight <b>days</b> <b>they</b> {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
60|$|They {{lived for}} many years on that inhospitable shore, And <b>day</b> by <b>day</b> <b>they</b> learned {{to love each other}} more and more. At last, to their astonishment, on getting up one <b>day,</b> <b>They</b> saw a frigate {{anchored}} in the offing of the bay.|$|R

5|$|During the fall, each {{write on}} the {{troubles}} in their relationship. David Beers, {{the founder of the}} Tyee, hosts a 100-mile Thanksgiving dinner for Smith while MacKinnon was away. In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to Kamloops where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> finally find a source of flour when they discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, and wheat. In December, Smith travels to Edmonton where her grandmother feeds her microwaved pasta which she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, was a critical success.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher and {{his team}} faced them {{three days after the}} Yorkshire match. The All Blacks had thus far played 27 matches on tour, scoring 801 points while conceding only 22, and all in only 88 <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> were {{struggling}} to field fifteen fit players; a number of their best players, including Stead, were unavailable due to injury.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George, however, {{carried his}} plan into effect. The next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> went to Antwerp; {{and on the}} <b>day</b> {{following}} <b>they</b> crossed the Belgian frontier, and entered Holland.|$|R
50|$|Early {{and late}} in the <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> hunt from {{concealed}} perches in the trees. In {{the middle of the}} <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> use long transects, quartering through or above the canopy, or search from a high soaring position. They attack by a stealthy glide, direct chase, or may stoop from a height.|$|R
50|$|While margays are nocturnal, in {{some areas}} they have also been {{observed}} to hunt during the <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> prefer {{to spend most of}} their life in the trees, but also travel across the ground, especially when moving between hunting areas. During the <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> rest in relatively inaccessible branches or clumps of lianas.|$|R
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|In February 1990, the Pittston Coal Company and the UMWA {{came to a}} settlement. The current miners of Pittston {{would receive}} health and {{retirement}} benefits once again. Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $10million for the retirement benefits plan for pre-1974 miners. In return Pittston was permitted to operate {{seven days a week}} {{as long as they were}} closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 <b>days</b> <b>they</b> would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid future lengthy elections, Gregory X {{introduced}} stringent rules with the 1274 promulgation of Ubi periculum. Cardinals were to be secluded in a closed area and not accorded individual rooms. No cardinal was allowed, unless ill, to be attended by more than two servants. Food was supplied through a window to avoid outside contact. After three days of the conclave, the cardinals were to receive only one dish a day; after another five <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> were to receive just bread and water. During the conclave, no cardinal was to receive any ecclesiastical revenue.|$|E

5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the <b>days</b> <b>they</b> {{had been in the}} race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|In the Central Asian-Turkic myths, Jupiter {{is called}} Erendiz or Erentüz, from eren (of {{uncertain}} meaning) and yultuz ("star"). There are many {{theories about the}} meaning of eren. These peoples calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> believed that some social and natural events connected to Erentüz's movements on the sky.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few <b>days</b> <b>they</b> encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
60|$|And on the selfsame <b>day</b> <b>they</b> were to {{proclaim}} that {{that first day}} should be a holy convocation unto them.

5|$|Keogh {{became the}} star of the tour, and played in at least 60 of the side's 74 matches in the British Isles. The {{schedule}} was grueling, with their matches played in only 175 <b>days.</b> <b>They</b> arrived in early October 1888, and by late November the team was regularly fielding injured players due to the high rate of injuries. In December the team played two internationals, against Ireland and Wales, with Keogh appearing in both.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four <b>days</b> <b>they</b> open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of North Carolina, the storm {{produced}} 34-foot (10-m) waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard. All nine were injured to some degree; three endured hypothermia, one received a broken rib, and one Coast Guardsman experienced back injuries from the surf. Another boat and its four occupants were reported missing, and after twelve <b>days</b> <b>they</b> remain missing. Rough waves from the precursor low left two kayakers missing near Seabrook Island, South Carolina. One was found the next day, {{and the other was}} found dead a week later.|$|E
