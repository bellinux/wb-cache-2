25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Speaking of second-generation artists emerging around the same time, Allmusic's Jason Ankeny wrote that Wainwright [...] "deserves to be heard regardless of his family tree". Furthermore, Ankeny complimented the musician for his songwriting abilities and his [...] "knack for elegantly rolling piano melodies and poignantly romantic lyrics". Music journalist Robert Christgau characterized Wainwright as a [...] "mind-boggling original" [...] whose talent is [...] "too big to let pass". One NME reviewer called the album [...] "floridly impersonal and [...] "grandiosely arranged", but also criticized Wainwright for being [...] "too overwrought and naff". Greenwald complimented Martha's backing vocals on the song [...] "In My Arms", as well as Parks' [...] "positively sterling" [...] string arrangement on [...] "Millbrook". Furthermore, he praised the vocal duet between Rufus and Martha on [...] "Sally Ann", claiming that a similar sibling performance had not been heard since The Everly Brothers. The album's cabaret elements and 1970s singer-songwriter style drew comparisons to Cole Porter and Joni Mitchell. Josh Kun of Salon.com wrote that Wainwright poetically incorporated [...] "foolish love and fantasy love, healing love and destructive love and love that {{makes you want to}} lose your sense of self <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> can find it again." [...] Kun asserted that the songs were [...] "built on a similar set of angled melodies and hairpin turns of phrase", and that each [...] "succeeds as its own distinctly intimate portrait of emotion and desire." ...|$|E

500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> get a different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E
2500|$|Gehringer's 127 RBIs in 1934 is all {{the more}} {{remarkable}} given the fact that he played in the same lineup with one of the greatest RBI men of all time, Hank Greenberg. [...] Gehringer later recalled that Greenberg would tell him: [...] "Just get the runner over to third", so Hank could drive them in. [...] Gehringer noted that [...] "Hank loved those RBIs", to the point that Gehringer once kidded Greenberg: [...] "You'd trip a runner coming around third base <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> could knock him in yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barakat {{said the}} writing process {{consisted}} of Gaskarth [...] "writing songs and us going into the studio to put in our two cents and changing a couple things around." [...] In an interview with <b>Just</b> <b>So</b> <b>You</b> Know, Gaskarth said the album title [...] "summarizes {{the theme of the}} songs, most of which centralize around escapism; running from my problems, burning bridges because of those problems; and the realization that its hard work to rebuild after those problems have torn people apart." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in what we do, and having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary." [...] He mentioned that [...] "there's one [...] that starts with classical guitar playing something that sounds like it could be out of vaudeville and it's that kind of thing that we really decided to go for on this record." ...|$|E

60|$|What {{a strange}} idea, to think me a Jew-hater! Isaiah and David and Heine are {{good enough for}} me; and I leave more unsaid.

6000|$|And of {{one thing}} I am sure, that in {{proportion}} as you are led and inspired by that Spirit of God which showed in our Lord, in the very deepest and truest sense, as the spirit of humanity, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> will feel a genial and hearty pleasure in lessening all human suffering, however slight; in increasing all harmless human pleasure, however transitory; and in copying Him who, at the marriage feast, gracefully and graciously turned the water into wine. I do not, of course, mean that you are to {{do no more than}} that; to prefer sentiment to duty, to amuse and glorify yourselves by paying tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. [...] But I do mean that you are not to distrust your own sentiments, not to crush your own instinctive sympathies. The very lowest of them--that which makes you shrink at the sight of pain, and rejoice in the sight of pleasure, is not natural, and common to you with the animals; it is supernatural and divine. It is a schoolmaster to bring you to Christ, to that higher inspiration of His, which tells your heart to alleviate the unseen woes which will never come into painful contact with your sensibilities, to bestow pleasures in which you yourself have no immediate share. It will tell your hearts {{especially in the case of}} this very Hospital for Consumption not to be slack in giving, because so much of what you will give--it is painful to recollect how much--will be spent, not in prevention, not even in cure, but in mere alleviation, mere increased bodily ease, mere savoury food, even mere passing amusements for wearied minds. Be it so. If (which God forbid) we could do nothing SAVE alleviate; if (which God forbid) permanent cure, even lengthening of life, were impossible, I should say just as much, Give. Give money to alleviate; give, even though what you give were, in the strictly economic sense, WASTED. We are ready enough, most of us, to waste upon ourselves. [...] It is well for us to taste once in a way the luxury of wasting on others; though I have yet to learn that anything can be called wasted which lessens, even for a moment, the amount of human suffering. A plan, for instance, is on foot for sending twenty of the patients to Madeira for the winter. The British Consul, to his honour, guarantees their maintenance, if the Hospital will pay their passage out and home. Some may say--An unnecessary expense--a problematical benefit. Be it so. I believe that it will not be such; that it may save many lives--they may revive: but were it not so, I would still say Give. Let them go, even if every soul in that ship were doomed. Let them go. Let them drink the fresh sea breeze before they die; let them see the green tropic world; let them forget their sorrow for a while; let them feel springing up afresh in them the celestial fount of hope. We let the guilty criminal eat and drink well the morn ere he is led forth to die--shall we not do as much by those who are innocent? ...|$|E
