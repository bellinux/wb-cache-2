5|$|Psyco is a {{just-in-time}} specialising compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode {{to machine}} code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain <b>data</b> <b>types</b> and is faster than standard Python code.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only <b>data</b> <b>types</b> were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers {{the ability}} to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms. Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined <b>data</b> <b>types</b> were included.|$|E
50|$|Data Type: The <b>Data</b> <b>Type</b> {{specifies}} how the payload of {{the message}} shall be interpreted with respect to its <b>data</b> <b>type</b> (i.e. floating-point <b>data</b> or number of bytes in case of integer data). The corresponding <b>data</b> <b>type</b> code is taken from the CANaerospace <b>data</b> <b>type</b> list which allows also user-defined <b>data</b> <b>type</b> definitions.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} programming languages, a recursive <b>data</b> <b>type</b> (also {{known as a}} recursively-defined, inductively-defined or inductive <b>data</b> <b>type)</b> is a <b>data</b> <b>type</b> for values that may contain other values of the same <b>type.</b> <b>Data</b> of recursive <b>types</b> are usually viewed as directed graphs.|$|R
50|$|Once {{declared}} deprecated, the <b>data</b> <b>type</b> will {{be maintained}} {{for at least}} two more years. After this period its default <b>data</b> <b>type</b> ID may be reused for an incompatible <b>data</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer <b>data</b> <b>types</b> used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, {{meaning that}} it is not {{designated}} as an integer, character, or any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL {{might not be able to}} automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the <b>data</b> <b>types</b> of all parameters, including those for which Null is passed.|$|E
