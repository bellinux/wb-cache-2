5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: <b>Innocent</b> Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in <b>Innocent</b> Sin. Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of <b>Innocent</b> Sin. <b>Innocent</b> Sin and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, <b>Innocent</b> Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from <b>Innocent</b> Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

5|$|<b>Innocent</b> {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that <b>Innocent</b> merely prepared secret letters in case <b>Innocent</b> needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope <b>Innocent</b> III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with <b>Innocent</b> in early 1209, worried that <b>Innocent</b> would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E

50|$|The Scandinavian parish at Pine Lake was {{established}} March 3, 1844, with {{the dedication of}} Holy <b>Innocents</b> Cemetery. Its log cabin church was constructed and dedicated in 1848. In 1850 the congregation split, with one group forming St. John's English Lutheran Church of Stone Bank in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. The {{other part of the}} congregation remained at the original log church and cemetery grounds. In 1864 this original church became known as Holy <b>Innocents</b> Episcopal Church, Nashotah. In 1895, the last survivor of the original Scandinavian parish legally transferred the land to Holy <b>Innocents.</b> In 1962, Holy <b>Innocents</b> merged with Grace-Holy <b>Innocents</b> Episcopal Church in Hartland, Wisconsin.

5|$|The papal {{conclave}} {{that had}} elected <b>Innocent</b> XIII in 1721 {{was dominated by}} cardinals appointed by Clement XI, who had been Pope for 21 years and appointed over 70 cardinals during that time. The conclave that elected <b>Innocent</b> was marked by a new alliance between the French and Spanish cardinals due {{to a change in}} the Spanish dynasty following the War of the Spanish Succession that resulted in Philip V, a Bourbon and the grandson of Louis XIV of France, ascending to what had previously been a Habsburg throne. <b>Innocent</b> was elected unanimously with the prospect that he might cooperate with both Bourbon France and the Hapbsurg Holy Roman Emperor. <b>Innocent</b> had been in poor health for the year before his death on 7 March 1724 and preparations for the conclave to elect his successor had begun before his death.|$|E
5|$|Then Lothair, who {{had hoped}} for the {{complete}} conquest of Sicily, gave Capua and Apulia from the Kingdom of Sicily to Roger's enemies. <b>Innocent</b> protested, claiming that Apulia fell under papal claims. Lothair turned north, but died while crossing the Alps on December 4, 1137. At the Second Council of the Lateran in April 1139, <b>Innocent</b> excommunicated Roger for maintaining a schismatic attitude. On March 22, 1139, at Galluccio, Roger's son RogerIII, Duke of Apulia ambushed the papal troops with a thousand knights and captured the pope. On March 25, 1139, <b>Innocent</b> was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the Treaty of Mignano.|$|E

50|$|At {{the edge}} of the {{cemetery}} there was a fountain, originally named Fountain of the Nymphs and now known as Fountain of <b>Innocents</b> (or Fontaine des <b>Innocents).</b> This fountain was dismantled in 1787 when the grounds of the church and cemetery were finally torn down and replaced by a stone laid square, place Joachim-du-Bellay. The square was originally a herb and vegetable market and was also known as Marché des <b>Innocents.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the '40s and '50s, the <b>Innocents</b> coordinated freshmen beanie {{sales and}} would wear {{identical}} jackets one day each week. Like the Missouri bell exchange, {{at this time}} an exchange with the University of Colorado was coordinated. The head of a buffalo was mounted for a mere $20 and named 'Mr. Chips'. Mr. Chips was then given to {{the winner of the}} annual Nebraska vs. Colorado football game. Unfortunately, in 1962 Mr. Chips somehow got misplaced by members of Colorado's Heart and Dagger Society, and the tradition was not continued. The <b>Innocents</b> of these years were quite the mischievous group, but many of these antics died down during the '70s. The '80s brought renewed spirit to the <b>Innocents,</b> and although the <b>Innocents</b> today no longer coordinate Dandelion Day or choose members of the spirit squad, they still carry on many of the traditions set forth by their founders. The <b>Innocents</b> of 2005-2006 sponsored a fundraiser for a local nonprofit organization, raising $10,000. The <b>Innocents</b> of 2007-2008 continued this philanthropic tradition by raising more than $14,000 for a local domestic abuse shelter.|$|R

5|$|At first, <b>Innocent</b> {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, <b>Innocent</b> had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

40|$|Terrorist {{violence}} is often condemned for targeting <b>innocents</b> or non-combatants. There are two objections to {{this line of}} argument.

Starting from a critique of Michael Walzer's account of supreme emergency, I will argue that the supreme emergency exemption justifies the resort to terrorism against <b>innocents</b> to avert moral disasters such as genocide and ethnic cleansing, provided that the criteria of last resort, proportionality and public declaration are satisfied...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>Innocent</b> VIII's death, the names of Cardinals Gherardo and Sanseverino (both created in pectore), had not been published, thus making them ineligible to {{participate}} in the conclave; however, both were published as an act of the College in sede vacante, Gherardo having been pushed by Giovanni Battista Orsini and Sanseverino by Ascanio Sforza. Gherardo was assigned the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, which it was believed <b>Innocent</b> VIII had intended for him; Sanseverino was given the poor and undesirable diaconate of San Teodoro to ensure that the future pontiff would confirm his assignment.|$|E
5|$|Both popes were consecrated and crowned on {{the same}} day, February 23. <b>Innocent</b> II {{received}} episcopal consecration from Cardinal Giovanni of Ostia in the church S.

Almost all Roman aristocracy (with the significant exception of the Frangipani family), {{the majority of the}} lesser clergy and the people of Rome recognized Anacletus II {{and at the end of}} May <b>Innocent</b> II had to flee to France.

5|$|De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which {{presented}} <b>Innocent</b> {{with two}} {{candidates for the}} office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over {{the rights of the}} king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. <b>Innocent</b> placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. <b>Innocent</b> went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when <b>Innocent</b> began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.|$|E
