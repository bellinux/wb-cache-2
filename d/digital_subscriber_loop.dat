In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for Internet access. DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher frequency bands for data. On the customer premises, a DSL filter on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.|$|E

40|$|High-rate bandwidth-efficient {{underwater}} acoustic communications {{have traditionally}} used singlecarrier modulation {{that relies on}} adaptive equalization to overcome the frequency-selective distortion of a multi-path channel. This method {{has served as a}} basis for real-time implementation of a high-speed acoustic modem at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (the WHOI micro-modem), and it has been successfully demonstrated in a variety of underwater channels. An alternative method for communicating over frequency-selective channels is multi-carrier modulation. In a multi-carrier system, the available bandwidth is divided into many narrow subbands, such that the channel distortion appears as flat (frequency-nonselective) within each subband. Thus, no equalization is needed per subband. Instead, modulation and demodulation have to be performed over multiple carriers. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a special case of multi-carrier modulation in which rectangular pulse shaping is used, leading to an efficient modulator/demodulator implementation via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). For this reason, OFDM has been applied in a number of radio systems, including wire-line <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>loops,</b> wireless <b>digital</b> audio and video broadcast and wireless local area networks. It is also considered for fourth-generation cellular systems. While it offers an elegant solution to the multipath problem, OFDM requires extremely accurate synchronization.

Methods for frequency synchronization in OFDM radio systems have been extensively studied, and numerous algorithms have been proposed.

The TEQ shortens the transmission channel impulse response (CIR) to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI). Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) and Minimum ISI (Min-ISI) methods achieve higher data rates at the TEQ output than previously published methods. As {{an alternative to the}} traditional equalizer, the per-tone equalizer (PTE) moves the TEQ into the FEQ and customizes a multi-tap FEQ for each tone. In this paper, we propose a time domain TEQ filter bank (TEQFB) and single TEQ that demonstrate better data rates at the FEQ output than MBR, Min-ISI, and least-squares PTE methods with standard CIRs, transmit filters, and receive filters. The contributions of this paper are: (1) a model for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the FFT output that includes ISI, near-end crosstalk, white Gaussian noise, analog-to-digital converter quantization noise and the digital noise floor; (2) data rate optimal time domain per-tone TEQ filter bank and the upper bound on bit rate performance it achieves; and (3) data rate maximization single TEQ design algorithm.
