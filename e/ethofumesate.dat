Separation of epicuticular wax into major components by gas-liquid chromatography indicated that <b>ethofumesate</b> decreased the deposition of n-nonocosane and n-nonocosan- 15 -one on cabbage leaves but increased the deposition of a minor component, the long chain waxy esters. EPTC was less inhibitory to n-nonocosan- 15 -one deposition than was <b>ethofumesate.</b> EPTC did not increase long chain waxy ester deposition. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that <b>ethofumesate</b> almost totally eliminated the epicuticular wax on cabbage leaves while EPTC only diminished it.

40|$|Earthworms {{represent}} an important food source for many vertebrates {{and as a}} result, predators may encounter toxic effects via the food chain from consumption of contaminated worms. Therefore, including an assessment of xenobiotic to worms in risk assessment procedures is advisable. Here we studied the acute toxicity, bioaccumulation and elimination of <b>ethofumesate</b> enantiomers in earthworm, Eisenia fetida, in a soil. A slight difference in toxicity to earthworm between two enantiomers was found, and the calculated LC 50 values for (+) -, rac- and (-) -ethofumesate were 4. 51, 5. 93 and 7. 98 mu g/cm(2), respectively, indicating that the acute toxicity of <b>ethofumesate</b> enantiomers was enantioselective. Earthworm can uptake <b>ethofumesate</b> but the bioaccumulation curve did not reach the steady state. In the elimination experiment, the concentrations of <b>ethofumesate</b> in earthworm declined following a first-order decay model with a short half life of 1. 8 d. The bioaccumulation and elimination of <b>ethofumesate</b> in earthworm were both nonenantioselective. In combination with other studies, a linear relationship between Log BSAFs and Log K-ow, was observed, and the Log BSAFs increased with increasing Log K-ow. But the elimination rate did not show any correlation with the K-ow value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

RESULTS All the WG formulations tested were effective in decreasing the apparent diffusivity of <b>ethofumesate</b> in soil {{in comparison with the}} non-formulated active substance. The slow-release effect was significantly more pronounced {{in the presence of the}} organically modified MMT, confirming the importance of sorption mechanisms to reduce <b>ethofumesate</b> diffusion. The bioassays undertaken on watercress to evaluate herbicidal antigerminating performances showed that all the WG formulations (with or without MMT) were more effective than both the commercial formulation and the non-formulated <b>ethofumesate,</b> whatever the concentration tested. To explain such results, it was proposed that WG formulations would enable <b>ethofumesate</b> to be more available and thus more effective in inhibiting seed germination, as they would be less prone to be leached by water transport due to watering and also less subject to photodegradation. CONCLUSION The use of pesticide formulations based on wheat gluten and nanoclays appeared to be a promising strategy both to reduce the mobility of pesticides in soil and to protect UV-photosensitive pesticides from photodegradation...|$|E

Despite the higher concentrations of the volatile chlorpropham (vapour pressure, VP: 1. 3 mP), plants showed no foliar injury, but vapours of this herbicide caused leaf crinkling in the agriophyte Agrostemma githago. The less volatile <b>ethofumesate</b> (VP: 0. 56 mP) caused foliar injury in all higher species, with lowest no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) of 75 ng m− 3.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} study non-target effects of difenoconazole (fungicide), deltamethrin (insecticide) and <b>ethofumesate</b> (herbicide) on microbial parameters in a clay-loam soil. Pesticides were applied as commercial formulations to soil samples at different concentrations (5, 50 and 500 mg kg− 1 DW soil) and then incubated under laboratory conditions for 3 months. Throughout the incubation period, microbial parameters were determined at days 7, 30, 60 and 90. At 5 mg kg− 1 DW soil, {{none of the three}} pesticides caused significant changes in soil microbial parameters. In contrast, at 500 mg kg− 1 DW soil, pesticide application decreased overall soil microbial activity, negatively affecting the activity of soil enzymes. Similarly, at 500 mg kg− 1 DW soil, difenoconazole and <b>ethofumesate,</b> but not deltamethrin, caused a pesticide-induced stress on soil microbial communities, as reflected by the respiratory quotient. Besides, deltamethrin and <b>ethofumesate</b> at 50 and 500 mg kg− 1 DW soil resulted in lower values of denitrification potential.

Glufosinate following <b>ethofumesate</b> applied preplant incorporated or <b>ethofumesate</b> applied postemergence in combination with glufosinate provided weed control similar to the standard herbicide program. Barnyardgrass control was lowest with glufosinate applied postemergence in combination with <b>ethofumesate.</b> Glufosinate treatments that were applied in combination with <b>ethofumesate</b> postemergence resulted in lower sugarbeet yields. Slight sugarbeet injury was observed early in the growing season when <b>ethofumesate</b> was applied postemergence. However, weed control was the main factor that affected sugarbeet yield. Treatments did not affect sugarbeet sucrose content. Field dodder control, with glyphosate, ranged from 98 to 100 percent, 42 days after treatment. Glyphosate treatments reduced dodder dry weight compared to a conventional, herbicide program of the commercial premix of desmedipham and phenmedipham, tank mixed with triflusulfuron, and clopyralid. Sugarbeet dry weight was greater, and dodder dry weight was lower with the conventional program compared to the untreated control and a single application of glufosinate. Three applications of glufosinate, at 0. 40 and 0. 80 kg ai/ha with 3. 4 kg ai/ha of AMS resulted in a lower dodder dry weight than three applications of glufosinate at 0. 30 kg/ha with AMS and the untreated control. Glyphosate reduced dodder growth in some cases when applied before dodder attachment to glyphosate-resistant sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied before attachment to glufosinate-resistant sugarbeets had no effect on dodder growth. Dipping a single leaf from a dodder infested sugarbeet in a glyphosate solution reduced the growth of dodder that was attached to other sugarbeet leaves on the same plant.

40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb {{and wild}} buckwheat, chamomile, mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and <b>Ethofumesate</b> are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. <b>Ethofumesate,</b> which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and Desmedipham. The high concentration of 200 g/L <b>Ethofumesate</b> leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum application rate per treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (Metamitron + Quinmerac) or Goltix® Gold (Metamitron) the weed spectrum is broadened.

40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds fumitory, fat hen and field poppy are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, spear thistle and curled dock are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that diclofop-methyl has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, field poppy, fumitory and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of fumitory and fat hen are influenced by application of <b>ethofumesate.</b> Chemical analysis shows that <b>ethofumesate</b> can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of fumitory and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + diclofop-methyl. Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to <b>ethofumesate,</b> by environmental conditions.

Therefore, a multi-compound pesticide extraction method using pressurized liquid extraction with associated substance determination using UHPLC-MS/MS was developed. Method development processes reveal best extraction results for an acetonitrile/ water mixture (2 : 1, v/v) at extraction temperatures of 80 °C or 100 °C during one cycle for a static time of 7 min.

Cultivars 'Utah Yellow Sweet Spanish' (YSS) and 'White Bermuda' were designated as tolerant and sensitive, respectively. Bromoxyml rates eliciting minimum and maximum responses in percent kill and fresh weight of the surviving plants were determined. Cultivar 'Winner' was identified as tolerant from the screening of cultivars with 5. 0 kg ae/ha bromoxynil.

40|$|Resistances in weeds for PS-II {{herbicides}} {{are well}} known. Since {{the end of}} the 1970 s especially resistances to triazines in maize represented a problem. Today, because of the variety of alternative active ingredients in maize, this problem is considered to be solved. This is different in sugar beet and potatoes because hardly any new herbicides have been developed during the last 20 years. Chenopodium album is a major weed in all summer crops. In maize, resistance to triazines (target-site resistance (TSR) at position 264 on the D 1 protein) is known. In recent years, new TSR in C. album (position 251 in Sweden and 218 in Lower Saxony, Germany) has been found. These biotypes exhibit resistances to triazinones and chloridazon but showed no cross-resistances to triazines. An outdoor pot trial with sugar beets and potatoes showed that higher dosages of <b>ethofumesate</b> in sugar beets and aclonifen in potatoes are able to control triazine and triazinone resistant C. album biotypes to certain extend or even completely, respectivly. A competition pot trial with maize and different C. album biotypes showed no significant differences in weed fitness concerning the parameters plant height, biomass and seed production...|$|E

40|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} {{analysis is}} a simple and rapid method for detecting herbicide effects after a short time following their application in photosynthetic apparatus in plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out against two broad of weeds to describe how the Kautsky curve and its parameters were affected by herbicides. Desmedipham + phenmedipham + <b>ethofumesate</b> changed the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve at all time intervals except four hours after spring (HAS) in Amaranthus retroflexus L. and at all doses of Portulaca oleracea L. 4 HAS. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence inhibition was evident by chloridazon at doses of 650 and 325 g a. i. ha- 1 in P. oleracea and A. retroflexus respectively, for all time intervals. Furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence decays only occurred by clopyralid in A. retroflexus at the highest dose. A biomass effective dose (ED 50 and/or ED 90) based on log-logistic dose-response curves for A. retroflexus were considerably {{higher than that of}} P. oleracea. The maximum quantum efficiency (FV/Fm) was stable, whereas the relative changes at the J step (Fvj) and area (the area between the Kautsky curve and the maximum fluorescence (Fm)) was more sensitive to all three herbicides. There was a relatively good correlation between fluorescence parameters taken 24 hours after the spraying and the dry matter taken three weeks later, for both species under study...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in sugar beet rotations, volunteer oilseed rape can occur in increased numbers in subsequent crops. The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with metamitron. Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments. A significantly higher reduction of plant fresh mass (shoot) > 90 % was caused by herbicide treatments that included the active ingredients desmedipham, phenmedipham, <b>ethofumesate,</b> chloridazon and quinmerac. The results showed that triflusulfuron is no longer suitable to control volunteers if they are derived from imidazolinone-tolerance expressing varieties. However, alternative herbicides are available. Generally, increased attention has to be paid to volunteer management within the whole crop rotation if imidazolinonetolerant oilseed rape is grown. Appropriate tillage strategies after oilseed rape harvest have to be followed by effective herbicide treatments in the subsequent sugar beet, for example a mixture of metamitron, phenmedipham, desmedipham, ethofumesat and lenaciel...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical {{decomposition}} {{of the water}} solution of the herbicide <b>Ethofumesate</b> (EFS) with the actived sludge (AS) adapted on EFS was studied. The EFS initial concentration was in the range S (0) = 0. 05 - 0. 2 mmol dm - 3, the AS initial concentration (expressed as the weight of dry biomass in the volume unit of the reaction mixture) was X(0) = 0. 4 - 2. 2 g dm - 3. Experiments were carried out in a batch isothermal stirred reactor at temperatures of 15 - 40 °C. It was found out that EFS is decomposed by means of AS very slowly. At given conditions, the initial velocity of the EFS docomposition was v = 3 to 30 mg EFS h - 1 g - 1 AS. Concentrations of AS and dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture were practically constant during the whole reaction time in all the experiments. The value of v decreased at 20 - 25 °C with increasing ratio of initial AS and EFS concentrations p = X 0 /S 0. At temperatures of 30 and 35 °C, an inductive period of ca two hours took place before EFS decomposition. In the liquid phase of the reaction mixture an unknown substance was found beside EFS, {{which is not a}} decomposition product of EFS bur originates probably from the microorganisms of AS. All the analyses carried out indicate a complicated reaction mechanism (probably dictated by physical rather then chemical steps) and the fact that EFS is a species hard to decompose biologically...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Volatile loss {{rates of}} {{pesticides}} from turfgrass were measured using the Backward-Time Lagrangian Stochastic Dispersion model (Flesch et al., 1995). Solar radiation, ambient temperature, surface temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed were monitored continuously. Growth regulator {{was applied to}} the turf plot several days before pesticide application to maintain a constant grass height and aerodynamic roughness length during the experiment. No irrigation occurred following application. Pesticides were applied as mixtures to allow direct comparison of evaporative loss. Mixtures studied were chlorpyrifos + triadimefon + <b>ethofumesate</b> and triclopyr (acetic acid) + propiconazole + cyfluthurin. Airborne flux estimates correlated with temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, time, and vapor pressure of the active ingredient. A log vapor pressure vs. 1 /Temperature (K) relationship was observed between flux and surface temperature over a single day for most pesticides. An exponential attenuation of flux was observed {{over a period of several}} days and correlated with attenuation of dislodgeable surface residues for two of the pesticides. A fugacity-based model for predicting initial evaporative loss rates from turf grass is presented. Input parameters include pesticide vapor pressure, molecular diffusion coefficient, surface temperature, wind speed profile, atmospheric stability, surface roughness, and average upwind fetch. The GC retention method (Jensen, 1966) was used to estimate pesticide vapor pressures over an environmentally relevant temperature range. The model predicts fluxes that are an order of magnitude greater than measured values. This bias may be due, in part, to deviation from the assumption of pesticide saturated vapor density at the foliar surface. In addition, sensitivity analysis suggests improved estimates of leaf surface temperature and pesticide vapor pressures have the greatest potential to improve model performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} eleven {{experiments}} dealing with (1) lime application, (2) herbicides, (3) nematicides, (4) varieties, (5) fungicides, (6) sowing date and (7) yield potential, are discussed. Lime was necessary, {{not to create}} a more neutral soil reaction, but to eliminate most of the exchangeable aluminium in the soil. It was necessary to incorporate lime to a depth of 200 mm but not deeper. Cycloate and <b>ethofumesate</b> applied at 3, 7 and 1,O kg ailha respectively allowed the crop to emerge free of weeds. Broadleaf weeds emerged soon afterwards and were controllled with an application of 0, 8 kg ailha desmedipham. The efficacy of cycloate depended on the method of incorporation. Nernaticides applied at very high rates prevented a decline iin the plant population due to Meloidogyne incognita but did not prevent serious losses in sucrose yield. Nematodes in clay soils would, for economic reasons, have to be controlled by cultural means. Varieties designated by the breeders as resistant to Cercospora beticola outyielded those that were not even though their resistance was only partial. Cremona, Kawerita' and AM 2 Hybrid B were noted as the best varieties for Niital. Triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) was the most effective fungicide used against Cercospora leaf spot while benomyl, which had proved effective in the past, was no longer effective againgt the disease. Fortnightly applications of TPTA from mid-December to the end of March controlled leaf spot almost completely at all sites. Crops grown at commercially acceptable standards yielded 6 to 8 tons sucrose per hectare in April and 10 to 12 tons sucrose per hectare in August and September...|$|E
40|$|At three test sites, <b>ethofumesate</b> (Nortron®) at 1. 0 and 2. 0 lb AI /A {{was safe}} on onions. Nortron {{appeared}} to provide marginal control {{of light to}} moderate weed infestations of London rocket (Sisymbrium irio) at two sites. Pendimethalin (Prowl®) at 0. 50 and 0. 75 lb Al/A was safe on onions at two sites with furrow irrigation. At three sites with sprinkler irrigation, Prowl treatments caused as high as 62 to 88 % stand reduction when sprinklers were used to incorporate the herbicide. Bensulide (Prefar 0) injured onions at early rating dates and height measurements indicated that the plants were shortened relative to the untreated check. End of the season visual observations showed that onions had grown out of the initial injury and the crop {{did not appear to}} be damaged. Prefar combined with Prowl or Nortron was more injurious to onions with sprinkler irrigation than with furrow irrigated incorporation. Prefar gave marginal weed control in the tests under conditions with low weed infestations. Lactofen (Cobra®) was injurious to onions at all five test sites and caused significant crop stand reduction. Combination treatments of Prowl with DCPA (Dacthal®) or Prefar were damaging to onions under sprinklers but injury was minimal with furrow irrigations. Metolachlor (Dual®) and dimethenamid (Frontier®) caused minimal injury and no stand reduction of onions under sprinklers but with furrow irrigation, the stand was reduced and height reduction was substantial. The series of field tests demonstrated that herbicide performance was significantly influenced by irrigation practices. Prowl herbicide was extremely injurious and caused substantial crop stand reduction with sprinkler irrigation. Dual and Frontier exhibited less injury on onions under sprinklers than with furrow irrigation. Cobra at 0. 25 lb AI /A was damaging to onions regardless of irrigation practice...|$|E
