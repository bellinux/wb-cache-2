A typical Canadian Sherbet {{possibly}} contains water, a sweetening agent, fruit or fruit juice, citric or tartaric acid, <b>flavouring</b> <b>preparation,</b> food colour, sequestering agent, lactose. Also, it may contain not more than 0.75% of stabilizing agent, not more than 0.5% microcrystalline cellulose, and not more than 1% added edible casein or edible caseinates. However, it shall contain not more than 5% milk solids which including milk fat, and not less than 0.35% acid that determined by titration and expressed as lactic acid.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, the {{regulations}} regarding naming conventions for brandy {{are similar to}} those of the US (provisions B.02.050–061). According to the Canadian food and drug regulations, Brandy shall be a potable alcoholic distillate, or a mixture of potable alcoholic distillates, obtained by the distillation of wine. The minimum specified aging period is six months in wood, although not necessarily oak (provision B.02.061.2).

5000|$|In Bulgarian cuisine, pita or pitka (пита or питка) {{is served}} on special occasions. It is a round bread loaf, which can {{sometimes}} be <b>flavoured.</b> Its <b>preparation</b> and consumption can have a ritual meaning. For example, {{on the night before}} Christmas Eve, (Бъдни вечер - Badni vecher) each housewife prepares a pita and decorates it with symbols to bring fertility to the cattle and a rich harvest from the fields, as well as prosperity to each member of the household. She hides a coin in it. Whoever finds the coin will be the healthiest and the wealthiest of the family. Prior to marriage, a bride's future mother-in-law prepares a pita for the newlyweds and sifts the flour seven times, so that the pita will be soft as their future life together. Pita is also prepared for guests. A traditional welcome in Bulgaria includes pita and honey or salt. The meaning of this ritual {{can be found in the}} expression [...] "to welcome someone with bread and salt" [...] (since bread is an important part of Bulgarian cuisine - and as a Bulgarian proverb says, [...] "no one is bigger than bread", and the salt is the basic ingredient that gives flavour to every meal).|$|R
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their <b>flavour</b> after industrial <b>preparation</b> in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|R
40|$|Both black (B) {{and green}} (G) {{cardamom}} {{are used as}} <b>flavours</b> during food <b>preparation.</b> This study investigated the responses to B and G in a diet-induced rat model of human metabolic syndrome. Male Wistar rats were fed either a corn starch-rich diet (C) or a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with increased simple sugars along with saturated and trans fats (H) for 16 weeks. H rats showed signs of metabolic syndrome leading to visceral obesity with hypertension, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular remodelling and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Food was supplemented with 3 % dried B or G for the final eight weeks only. The major volatile components were the closely related terpenes, 1, 8 -cineole in B and α-terpinyl acetate in G. HB (high-carbohydrate, high-fat + black cardamom) rats showed marked reversal of diet-induced changes, with decreased visceral adiposity, total body fat mass, systolic blood pressure and plasma triglycerides, and structure and function {{of the heart and}} liver. In contrast, HG (high-carbohydrate, high-fat + green cardamom) rats increased visceral adiposity and total body fat mass, and increased heart and liver damage, without consistent improvement in the signs of metabolic syndrome. These results suggest that black cardamom is more effective in reversing the signs of metabolic syndrome than green cardamom...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adequate bowel {{preparation}} {{is an important}} step for an effective colonoscopy. Polyethylene glycol solution (Kleanprep) and sodium picosulphate with a magnesium citrate solution (Picoprep) are bowel cleansing agents registered and available for this purpose. So far, the results of studies comparing the effectiveness of bowel cleansing between the two agents are inconclusive. This may be because of differences in administration regimes and subjective measurement of bowel cleansing. In this single-blinded randomized-controlled trial, the effectiveness of Kleanprep and Picoprep was examined using a split-dose regimen and an objective bowel cleansing score system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-three consecutive patients referred for outpatient colonoscopy were included, the required number based on power analysis. Eighty-eight patients received Kleanprep; 85 received Picoprep. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of bowel cleansing using the Boston Bowel Preparation Score. The secondary outcome was patient tolerability measured using a questionnaire. An intention-to-treat-analysis was carried out. RESULTS: The overall Boston Bowel Preparation Score between Kleanprep and Picoprep was not significantly different (P= 0. 182). On reviewing segment scores, there were also no significant differences between Kleanprep and Picoprep. Patients using Picoprep scored significantly better on the aspects of convenience and <b>flavour</b> of the <b>preparation</b> agent compared with patients using Kleanprep (P< 0. 001). Side effects such as nausea (P= 0. 011), vomiting (P= 0. 001), headache (P= 0. 003) and bloating (P< 0. 001) were experienced less significantly by patients using Picoprep. CONCLUSION: The present study did not find a difference in the effectiveness of bowel cleansing between Kleanprep and Picoprep. Both were found to be adequate cleansing agents. Picoprep was significantly better tolerated than Kleanprep. Therefore, we recommend Picoprep as a first-choice regimen for bowel preparation before colonoscopy...|$|R
40|$|Gluten is {{the mixture}} of {{proteins}} remaining in wheat flour after starch and water soluble components have been extracted by washing. Its unique dough forming properties are due {{to the structure of}} the proteins. A feature of the protein is the high glutamine content, about 30 % of the total amino acids. A number of studies have shown that gluten's properties of insolubility and water-binding can be substantially modified by mild acid hydrolysis. The principal effect of the mild acid treatment is to hydrolyse the amide side chain of glutamine such that the amide group is replaced by a carboxyl group. In addition, it is known that hydrolysis of peptide bonds can have a large influence on the functional properties of proteins. The aims of this study were to determine the kinetics of the acid catalysed deamidation and peptide bond hydrolysis reactions, and to comment on the resultant changes in functional properties. A statistically designed experiment was used to determine the effect of temperature, hydrogen ion concentration and gluten concentration. An initial rate analysis of the results showed that reactions could be described by equations of the form: Rate of amide bond hydrolysis = k 1. [Amide][H+] and Rate of peptide bond hydrolysis = k 2 [Peptide] [H+] where k = koe -E/R. 1 /T A stoichiometric analysis of the experimental data confirmed that hydrogen ions were consumed in both reactions. A numerical solution was developed to predict the extent of reaction with time. A computer program incorporating the solution was used to simulate the reaction and test the solution. The simulation results appeared to overestimate the progress of the reaction with time. A series of ten gluten powders, hydrolysed to different extents was prepared at small pilot scale. The composition of the samples was determined and compared with the extent of hydrolysis predicted by the reaction simulation. Reasonable agreement was achieved. A selection of the functional properties of the prepared samples was examined. The quantity of alkali required to dissolve each preparation to the extent of its solubility at pH 7. 6 increased markedly with the extent of hydrolysis due to the additional carboxyl groups requiring neutralization. The <b>flavour</b> of each <b>preparation</b> was exanined. A cereal flavour was found to decrease with the extent of hydrolysis. A lingering bitter flavour was found to increase with the extent of hydrolysis. The solubility of all preparations at p H 7. 6 in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer increased with the extent of treatment so that the most hydrolysed samples were almost completely soluble. No (significant) difference was found between freeze dried and spray dried samples. Samples prepared without dialysis showed no solubility difference from those prepared with dialysis at a similar extent of hydrolysis. The hydrophobicity of the preparations was measured using two different fluorescent probes and was found to increase with the extent of hydrolysis. The emulsion-forming properties of the preparations were found to depend on the oil used in the test, as would be expected if hydrophobicity was equivalent to the hydrophile lipophile balance, which is commonly used to classify emulsifying agents. The preparations did not, however, show the additivity properties of emulsifiers. It was also shown that only the soluble portion of the preparations was responsible for emulsion formation. The possibility of achieving deamidation of gluten using the enzymes peptidoglutaminase I and II was examined. No activity against gluten or partially hydrolysed gluten was found...|$|R
