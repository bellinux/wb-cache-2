The purpose of the quantitative correlation study was to explore gender-based compensation inequities within the U.

By employing descriptive and correlation analysis, compensation factors were analyzed that found gender-wage inequities for specific compensation factors in the construction industry and four significant relationships between compensation factors and gender. Inequities were identified in the descriptive analysis of compensation factors that included (a) base salary; (b) additional compensation; (c) base increase per year; (d) educational background; (e) time off; (f) tuition benefits; (g) vehicle allowance; and (h) retirement benefits.

40|$|How to {{estimate}} the probability of rare long-distance trips The vehicle distances travelled by individual users can very strongly between different days. This is particularly problematic for electric vehi-cles since trips larger than the electric range clearly reduce the vehicle’s utility.

The general formalism is developed and estimates for the main observable and standard errors are derived based on the assump-tion of individual log-normal distributed <b>daily</b> <b>vehicle</b> kilometres travelled. Numerical simulations of driving profiles demonstrate the validity an...|$|R
