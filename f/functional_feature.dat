25|$|Homocystinuria due to CBS {{deficiency}} is {{a special}} type of hyperhomocysteinemia. It is a rare, hereditary recessive autosomal disease, in general, diagnosed during childhood. A total of 131 different homocystinuria-causing mutations have been identified. A common <b>functional</b> <b>feature</b> of the mutations in the CBS domains is that the mutations abolish or strongly reduce activation by adoMet. No specific cure has been discovered for homocystinuria; however, many people are treated using high doses of vitamin B6, which is a cofactor of CBS.|$|E
25|$|Samovar-like pottery {{was found}} in Shaki, Azerbaijan in 1989. It was {{estimated}} to be at least 3,600 years old. While it differed from modern samovars in many respects, it contained the distinguishing <b>functional</b> <b>feature</b> of an inner cylindrical tube that increased the area available for heating the water. Unlike modern samovars, the tube was not closed from below, and so the device relied on an external fire (i.e. by placing it above the flame) instead of carrying its fuel and fire internally.|$|E

In {{signature verification}} number of signatures avalible to train a model is very limited, and therefore identification of the most suitable features which characterize the class is critical. Therefore feature selection is essential to minimize the classification error. The mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) method is applied to select the features. Verification is based on global features and scores from <b>functional</b> <b>features.</b> The scores are generated by comparing the <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> of the test signature with the corresponding reference features.

50|$|Proteins of the Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) family (TC# 2.A.15) {{are found}} in Gram-negative and Gram-positive {{bacteria}} and archaea. The BCCT family is a member {{a large group of}} secondary transporters, the APC superfamily. Their common <b>functional</b> <b>feature</b> is that they all transport molecules with a quaternary ammonium group (CH3)3. The BCCT family proteins vary in length between 481 and 706 amino acyl residues and possess 12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The x-ray structures reveal two 5 TMS repeats with the total number of TMSs being 10. These porters catalyze bidirectional uniport or are energized by pmf-driven or smf-driven proton or sodium ion symport, respectively, or else by substrate:substrate antiport. Some of these permeases exhibit osmosensory and osmoregulatory properties inherent to their polypeptide chains.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{assumed that the}} spatial meaning of between is only based on spatial {{features}} (geometrically definable cognitive representations; see, e. g. Johnston and Slobin, 1979). This chapter first considers how spatial features represent the meaning of between. It then considers a possible impact of visual <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> (visually perceived spatial features, like cartoon-like eyes, that invite a particular object categorization, such as ‘this is an animal’), linguistic <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> (lexical concepts inviting a particular categorization, as derived from ‘this is a thumb’), general <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> (features contributed by cognitive processes found across cognitive systems, like cognitive effort), and dynamic–kinematic features (features specifying actual or potential interactions between physical entities). After considering why between can correspond {{to more than one}} spatial prototype it is discussed which of the above features are lexical features, which features are contextual features, and how features of different types may interact to specify the meaning of between in context...|$|R

It is claimed that the primary reason for this occurrence is the lack of the <b>functional</b> <b>feature</b> T(ense) [+/-past] in Mandarin Chinese. If a particular <b>functional</b> <b>feature</b> is missing in a learner's L 1 grammar, it is thought that it will be absent in one's L 2 grammar as well.

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> in language and space. Let us start by exploring what <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> might {{play a role in}} spatial language. Consider the above quote above hammers. A paraphrase of that quote could be having a hammer encourages one to view others in light of their potential interactions with the hammer. For example, if a spider were crawling across the floor, you might think of a squashing function that involves the head of the hammer. In contrast, if a lid were stuck on a jar, you might think of a prying function that involves the claw of the hammer. In this way, various perceptual features or affordances of the object (hammer) in conjunction with the goal of the user (kill the spider, open the lid) dictate the type of interaction between the objects. The concept of <b>functional</b> <b>features</b> thereby contains the following elements: perceptual properties or affordances of the objects (features); the functions or uses that such features enable (functions); and the means by which such features are used in the context of satisfying a goal (<b>features</b> that are <b>functional)</b> ...|$|R
