40|$|Abstract 1 — Steam whirl {{instability}} occurrence and modelling is described, {{and some}} weak point s in usual modelling and in standard stability criteria are discussed. The motivation {{of the present}} study is a case history of a steam turbine that experienced a heavy steam whirl instability though the calculated stability margin in design conditions was sufficiently high. During the start up of a power plant the 425 MW steam turbo generator showed an unstable vibrational behaviour as soon as maximum output power was approached. The combined effect of steam excitation in bladed rows, in the <b>steam</b> <b>glands</b> and of low damping in some of the oil film bearings was most likely the main cause of the observed malfunction. A model of the group has been set up, the steam whirl exciting force coefficients and the oil film bearing coefficients have been applied and eigenfrequencies and damping factors have been calculated. In order to check the accuracy of this calculation also another method based on energy balance has been used but very similar values have been obtained, confirming the accuracy of the standard stability evaluation approach. The calculation showed that the machine should have been stable, with a sufficient margin of stability, in design conditions. Therefore the steam whirl excitation models have been analysed for identifying possible weak points which could justify the discrepancies between experimental behaviour and calculated results...|$|R

40|$|Solar steam {{turbines}} {{are subject to}} high thermal stresses {{as a result of}} temperature gradients during transient operation, which occurs more frequently due to the variability of the solar resource. In order to increase the flexibility of the turbines while preserving lifing requirements, several operational modifications for maintaining turbine temperatures during offline periods are proposed and investigated. The modifications were implemented in a dynamic thermal turbine model and the potential improvements were quantified. The modifications studied included: increasing the <b>gland</b> <b>steam</b> pressure injected to the end-seals, increasing the back pressure and increasing the barring speed. These last two take advantage of the ventilation and friction work. The effects of the modifications were studied both individually as well as in different combinations. The temperatures obtained when applying the combined modifications were compared to regular turbine cool-down temperatures and showed significant improvements on the start-up times of the turbine...|$|E

The motivation {{of the present}} study is the case history of asteam turbine that experienced heavy steam-whirl instability though the calculated stability margin was sufficiently high in design conditions.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} exergy destroyed by {{operation of a}} conventional steam power plant is computed via an exergy cascade. An order of magnitude analysis shows that exergy destruction is dominated by combustion and heat transfer across temperature differences inside the boiler, and conversion of energy entering the turbine/generator sets from thermal to electrical. Combustion and heat transfer inside the boiler accounts for 53. 83 {{percent of the total}} exergy destruction. Converting thermal energy into electrical energy is responsible for 41. 34 percent of the total exergy destruction. Heat transfer across the condenser accounts for 2. 89 percent of the total exergy destruction. Fluid flow with friction is responsible for 0. 50 percent of the total exergy destruction. The boiler feed pump turbine accounts for 0. 25 percent of the total exergy destruction. Fluid flow mixing is responsible for 0. 23 percent of the total exergy destruction. Other equipment including <b>gland</b> <b>steam</b> condenser, drain cooler, deaerator and heat exchangers are, in the aggregate, responsible for {{less than one percent of}} the total exergy destruction. An energy analysis is also given for comparison of exergy cascade to energy cascade. Efficiencies based on both the first law and second law of thermodynamics are calculated for a number of components and for the plant. The results show that high first law efficiency does not mean high second law efficiency. Therefore, the second law analysis has been proven to be a more powerful tool in pinpointing real losses. The procedure used to determine total exergy destruction and second law efficiency can be used in a conceptual design and parametric study to evaluate the performance of other steam power plants and other thermal systems...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{shares of}} {{renewable}} energy sources {{in the market and}} solar thermal power applications have set higher requirements on steam turbine operation. These requirements are related to flexibility during transients. A key aspect sought of such flexibility is the capability for fast starts. Due to the varying temperature gradients during start-up, the speed at which the turbine can start is constrained by thermal stresses and differential expansion. These phenomena either consume component lifetime or may result in machine failure if not carefully controlled. In order to accomplish faster starts while ensuring that lifing requirements are preserved, it is important to analyze the thermal behavior of the machine. For this, a transient thermal model was developed with a focus on adaptability to different turbine sizes and geometries. The model allows for simple and fast prediction of thermo-mechanical properties within the turbine metal, more importantly, of the temperature distribution and the associated thermal expansion. The next step of this work was to validate the assumptions and simplifications of the model. This was done through the study and comparison of two turbines against measured operational data from their respective power plants. Furthermore,validation studies also included comparisons concerning the geometric detail level of the model. Overall, comparison results showed a large degree of agreement with respect to the measured data and between the geometric detail levels. The validated model was then implemented in studies related to reducing start-up times and peak differential expansion. For this, the potential effects of turbine temperature maintaining modifications were investigated and quantified. The modifications studied included: increasing <b>gland</b> <b>steam</b> pressure, increasing back pressure and increasing barring speed. Results yielded significant improvements starting from 9. 5 % in the start-up times and 7 % in the differential expansion. QC 20141128 </p...|$|E
