25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive at the light source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can not look at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit about everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 18th century, the Inquisition changed: Enlightenment {{ideas were}} the closest threat {{that had to}} be fought. The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the {{abolition}} of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them Olavide, in 1776; Iriarte, in 1779; and Jovellanos, in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them: [...] "friars who take [...] only to obtain gossip and exemption from choir; who are ignorant of foreign languages, who only <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> scholastic theology".|$|E
