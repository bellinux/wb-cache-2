ABSTRACT: The {{analysis}} and information ordering {{on the forest}} sector generate data that may assist both strategic decisions making and new public policies development. Thus, the analyze of Vouchers for Releasing <b>Forestry</b> <b>Credit</b> (Comprovantes de Liberação de Crédito Florestal- CLCF) is essential, which is currently {{one of the main}} tools utilized by Mato Grosso State for control and inspection released areas to legal obtaining the tropical timber, either through Sustainable Forest Management Plans (Planos de Manejo Florestal Sustentável- PMFS) or through the Forest Exploration Plans (Planos de Exploração Florestal- PEF). The study aimed to evaluate the Authorizations for Forest Exploration (Autorizações d...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} few decades, forestland {{management}} have changed {{in response to the}} improved patterns of resource use in rural China. Two main questions arise: what factors are to have an impacts on forestland use, and how does forestland management adapt to forestland use changes. Most researches mainly focus on forestland transfer for the forestland use, since forestland transfer has been the effective way of achieving intensive management. The forest tenure reform breeds new management modes and management methods for forestland change as the most basic driving force. However, there are some aspects need to be improved and further discussion is required, including constructing <b>forestry</b> <b>credit</b> system, perfecting mortgage system, and improving assets evaluation system and service mechanism. This paper summarizes the existing studies on forestland use and management from the reform of forestry system, forestland use change and forestland management...|$|E

According to the NPA, prior to South Sudan's declaration of Independence, beginning in 2007, private interests sought or secured 5.15 million hectares of land in the agriculture, biofuels, <b>forestry,</b> carbon <b>credit,</b> and ecotourism sectors—equivalent to more than eight percent of South Sudan’s total land area.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, UPCA {{requested}} Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos {{to allow}} the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey also {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on November 20, 1972, PD No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of <b>Forestry,</b> Agricultural <b>Credit</b> and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units.|$|R
5|$|In August 2009, {{forestry}} {{companies were}} selling units to NZ and international buyers. Forester Ernslaw One converted 520,000 NZ units into Assigned amount units {{and sold them}} to the Norwegian Government, in a landmark ground breaking deal brokered by leading New Zealand carbon broker, Carbon Market Solutions Ltd. At the time, {{it was the largest}} <b>forestry</b> carbon <b>credit</b> deal in the world. Industry sources estimated the prices were approximately $NZ21 to $NZ22 a tonne and that value of the trade would have been between $NZ10.9 million and $NZ11.4 million, depending on the exchange rate. Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} further detail on expected global GHG emission levels in 2020, {{based on the}} Emissions Gap Report (United Nations Environment Programme, December 2010), assuming the emission reduction proposals in the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements are met. Large differences {{are found in the}} results of individual groups owing to uncertainties in current and projected emission estimates and in the interpretation of the reduction proposals. Regardless of these uncertainties, the pledges for 2020 are expected to deliver emission levels above those that are consistent with a 2 degrees C limit. This emissions gap could be narrowed through implementing the more stringent conditional pledges, minimizing the use of "lenient" credits from forests and surplus emission units, avoiding double-counting of offsets and implementing measures beyond current pledges. Conversely, emission reduction gains from countries moving from their low to high ambition pledges could be more than offset by the use of lenient land use, land-use change and <b>forestry</b> (LULUCF) <b>credits</b> and surplus emissions units, if these were used to the maximum. Laying the groundwork for faster emission reduction rates after 2020 appears to be crucial in any case...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} motivation, willingness, and {{technical}} {{as well as}} managerial capacities of U. S. cities to store carbon and sell carbon offsets. Based on {{a national survey of}} urban foresters, arborists, and other officials responsible for urban forest management within U. S. municipal governments, results indicate that local governments are interested in selling carbon offsets. An estimated Probit discrete choice model shows that the chance of a city participating in carbon trading is positively influenced by a number of factors including: (1) level of urbanization, (2) management's knowledge of carbon sequestration, (3) revenue generation from offset sales, (4) population education level, and (5) familiarity with carbon market institutions such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The cost of living, as reflected by median home prices, appears to be inversely related to the probability of participation. Currently, a number of cities have the technical and managerial capacity to establish quality carbon offset criteria such as enforceability, additionality, verifiability, and baseline establishment. However, many cities are still unaware of carbon sequestration opportunities, and {{there appears to be a}} fundamental disconnect to market participation. The results also suggest that municipal governments would gain from a better understanding of the costs and benefits associated with urban forest carbon storage.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} recognition that <b>forestry</b> carbon <b>credits</b> {{can reduce the}} net emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. Designing systems to sequester carbon, however, has proven difficult due {{to a number of}} efficiency issues, including leakage. Leakage occurs when policy makers develop carbon projects in specific places which protect some parcels of land, but leave other parcels of land unprotected. This analysis uses a newly developed model of global land use change from an established forestry and land use model, described in Sohngen et al. (1999); Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2003); and Kindermann et al. (2008). To assess leakage we estimate carbon under storage under one scenario where the world is awarded carbon credits and another where tropical developing nations are awarded the credits. We focus our results on several regions, namely Brazil, the rest of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Carbon prices are assumed to be constant, and range from US$ 0 tC to US$ 900 tC. The model adjusts global land uses to these specific policies, and leakage is assessed by comparing carbon gains within the project areas to net global changes in carbon. A number of policy relevant results emerge. First, the estimates indicate that leakage ranges from 2 % to more than 14 %. Second, as carbon credits increase, leakage decreases across the world.

500|$|Rod Oram commented in a Sunday Star Times {{column that}} the National Government's {{changes to the}} ETS were [...] "a giant step backwards" [...] which would [...] "drive up emissions, {{perpetuate}} old technology, necessitate ever-greater subsidies and reduce New Zealand's international competitiveness and reputation." [...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing <b>forestry</b> holders of <b>credits</b> to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|R
40|$|The Arid Lands Information Network (ALIN) is principally {{for field}} workers, project managers, group leaders and local {{government}} officials. ALIN is a British NGO, based in Dakar, Senegal, {{which is designed to}} help people working in the field to obtain information. It also provides them with a means of exchanging experiences and ideas. Field workers, who can enjoy full membership of ALIN, have in common a practical approach to development because they work closely with local people. Associate members, such as programme managers, administrators, representatives of NGOs, scientists and consultants can support the ALIN network by taking into consideration, when planning projects, the views of those who have first hand experience in the field. The ALIN network now has more than a thousand members in 29 African countries. Its publications, in English and French, are available free to full members, as is membership for all those working in arid regions. ALIN's membership list gives details about members' occupations and where they can be contacted so that information can be exchanged directly between members or visits and local workshops organized. BAOBAB is the Network's magazine. It provides a link, three times a year, between members who themselves write the articles, and express concerns and points of view on development topics such as cereal banks, <b>credit,</b> <b>forestry</b> and pastoralism. Exchange visits. Full members may obtain help from ALIN for financing and organizing exchange visits to projects similar to their own. Local workshops. The local workshops financed by ALIN provide an opportunity for field workers to share their experiences and their concerns about development matters. Publications. ALIN produces a number of publications. Among others are: The paravets of Loumbol; The paravets of Kenya, and Restocking in Kenya. A booklet on Cereal banks at your sevice? comprises a collection of case studies and information about pricing. A book entitled Looking after our land, which is accompanied by a video, presents a new approach to the conservation of soil and water.
