5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of <b>dairy</b> <b>sheep</b> vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and <b>dairy,</b> <b>sheep,</b> goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E

This paper aims to estimate technical efficiency in the Sardinian <b>sheep</b> <b>dairy</b> industry. A stochastic frontier analysis approach was used on panel data from 36 <b>sheep</b> <b>dairy</b> firms over the period 2004 - 2009 in order to assess whether there are some margins for technical improvements in productivity, given the existing level of technology. A comparative analysis of private firms and cooperatives was also carried out, in order to establish if there were differences in the technology they used and/or their efficiency in using technical inputs. Our findings suggest that there is technological homogeneity among the firms and between private firms and cooperatives. Technical efficiency is equal to 0. 905 and it is significantly different between private firms (0. 933) and cooperatives (0. 877). Our findings have certain implications for what policies should be implemented in order to improve efficiency in the sector and on the orientation of decision makers strategies. <b>Sheep</b> <b>dairy</b> industry, technical efficiency, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), private firms and cooperatives, Sardinia, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
