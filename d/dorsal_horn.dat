25|$|The sensory {{modality}} that {{is detected}} by the afferent fibers {{is an important}} factor to consider because it determines the pathway that the dorsal root ganglion neurons will take within the central nervous system. The sensory neurons coming from the body synapse in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> of the spinal cord, bringing in information about touch sensations (epicritic), or modalities of pain (protopathic). While both types of sensory neurons must first synapse in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> of the spinal cord, the area of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> where they synapse is different. Their pathway to the thalamus is also different.|$|E

25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn.</b> This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of neuropathic pain {{is a complex}} phenomenon involving a process of peripheral and central sensitization producing enhanced transmission of nociceptive inputs to the brain associated {{with the loss of}} discriminatory processing of noxious and innocuous stimuli. This increased flow of abnormally processed nociceptive inputs to the brain may overcome the ability of descending modulatory pathways to produce analgesia, causing further worsening of the pain. Several crucial locations involved in the physiologic {{generation of}} pain inputs (eg, peripheral nociceptors, <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns,</b> thalamus, cortex) show evidence of functional reorganization and altered nociceptive processing in association with chronic pain. These locations present the best targets for therapeutic intervention, including systemic administration of drugs able to counteract the chemical storm induced by neural injuries in the nociceptive afferents and <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns,</b> or for more focused intervention, such as neuroablative procedures; intrathecal drug delivery; and spinal cord, deep brain, or motor cortex stimulation...|$|R

It has been established, that the expressiveness of the behavoiur appearance of the pain syndrome, arising with the application {{to the field of}} the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the agar plate with penicilline, is being determined by the dose of convulsant. The new model of allodiny has been developed.

25|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM have {{clinical}} signs. The presence of signs is correlated to {{the width of}} the syrinx and extent of spinal cord <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> damage. Syrinxes can progressively expand and a dog which is asymptomatic in early life may eventually experience pain.|$|E
25|$|The (spinal cord) <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> neurons {{give rise}} to the spinothalamic tract (STT), which {{constitutes}} the major ascending nociceptive pathway. As a consequence of spontaneous activity arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally innocuous tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central sensitization. Central sensitization is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.|$|E

Locomotor abnormalities in the pelvic limbs and vertebral malformation were found in both animals, and arthrogryposis was also present in the calf. The mielodysplasia was very similar in these animals, and both were characterized by non separation of ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns,</b> areas with medular canal duplication and syringomyelia. No cases of spina bifida was previously described in Brazil...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a strong}} body of {{evidence}} that the so-called sensitization of {{the central nervous system}} contributes to the emergence of allodynia. Sensitization refers to the increased response of neurons following repetitive stimulation. In addition to repeated activity, the increased levels of certain compounds lead to sensitization, as well. The work of many researchers has led to the elucidation of pathways that can result in neuronal sensitization both in the thalamus and <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns.</b> Both pathways depend on the production of chemokines and other molecules important in the inflammatory response.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time it has been detected, that the local action on the opiate-sensitive link of the inlet afferent systems, located in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the myelon, brings to the {{supression}} of the nociceptive cardiavascular reflexes. At this, only excitation action of signals of the somatic afferents on the vasoconstructiveneurons is being supressed. The braking action of these signals is not touched.

25|$|Recently {{this idea}} has regained some {{credibility}} {{under a new}} term, central sensitization. Central sensitization occurs when neurons in the spinal cord's <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> or brainstem become more responsive after repeated stimulation by peripheral neurons, so that weaker signals can trigger them. The delay in appearance of referred pain shown in laboratory experiments can be explained due to {{the time required to}} create the central sensitization.|$|E
25|$|All sensory fibers {{from these}} nerves {{terminate}} in the trigeminal nucleus. On entering the brainstem, sensory fibers from V, VII, IX and X are sorted {{and sent to}} the trigeminal nucleus (which contains a sensory map of the face and mouth). The spinal counterparts of the trigeminal nucleus (cells in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> and dorsal column nuclei of the spinal cord) contain a sensory map {{of the rest of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Axon reflex {{suggests}} that the afferent fiber is bifurcated before connecting to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn.</b> Bifurcated fibers do exist in muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs. Yet these particular neurons are rare and are not representative of the whole body. Axon-Reflex also does not explain the time delay before the appearance of referred pain, threshold differences for stimulating local and referred pain, and somatosensory sensibility changes {{in the area of}} referred pain.|$|E

The fibres cross the midline via the commissural nucleus of Cajal. No evidence of vagal afferent fibres was found in the reticular formation, the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, the external cuneate nucleus or the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the first and second cervical spinal segments.

40|$|The Ephrin type B receptors (EphB) {{and their}} ephrinB ligands are {{involved}} in distinct facets of cell physiology and pathophysiology. EphB-ephrinB signaling mediates synapse formation and plasticity by controlling the insertion, localization and function of glutamate receptors in synaptic membranes. Whereas, EphB-ephrinB signaling at the excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the spinal cord, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pain. Here, the key evidence that support the participation of EphB-ephrinB signaling in pain processes are highlighted. Then, a possible role for the pseudokinase EphB 6 in the EphB-ephrinB pain signaling complex is considered. These pathways are currently being intensely studied to exploit selective therapeutic targets for pain relief...|$|R
25|$|Using {{this method}} {{it has been}} {{observed}} that significantly higher stimulus strength is needed to obtain referred pain relative to the local pain. There is also a strong correlation between the stimulus intensity and the intensity of referred and local pain. It is also believed that this method causes a larger recruitment of nociceptor units resulting in a spatial summation. This spatial summation results in a much larger barrage of signals to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> and brainstem neurons.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the NMDA {{receptor}} {{is thought}} to be responsible for the anesthetic, amnesic, dissociative, and hallucinogenic effects of ketamine. The mechanism(s) of action for the antidepressant effects of ketamine at lower doses have yet to be fully elucidated. NMDA receptor antagonism results in analgesia by preventing central sensitization in <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> neurons; in other words, ketamine's actions interfere with pain transmission in the spinal cord. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase lowers the production of nitric oxide – a gasotransmitter involved in pain perception, hence further contributing to analgesia.|$|E
25|$|What {{they found}} was that many {{herpetic}} areas representing the peripheral distribution of single roots or individual sections of the cord, corresponded closely with areas of referred pain from diseases of different internal organs. This led Head to conclude that irradiation of abnormal afferent impulses produces a state of excessive irritability in the grey matter of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> at the level which they enter it. As a result of this, impulses from the skin that pass through it are exaggerated or disordered so that a stimulus that would not usually provoke a painful reaction does so.|$|E
50|$|Since its discovery, nociceptin {{has been}} of great {{interest}} to researchers. Nociceptin is a peptide related to the opioid class of compounds (ex. morphine and codeine), but it does not act at the classic opioid receptors (namely, mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) which typically act as pain relievers. Nociceptin is widely distributed in the CNS; it is found in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and forebrain, {{as well as in the}} ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the spinal cord. The NOP receptor is also widely distributed throughout areas of the brain, including the cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, lateral septum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, central gray, pontine nuclei, interpeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra, raphe complex, locus coeruleus, and spinal cord.|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) results in complex {{posttraumatic}} sequelae affecting the whole neuraxis. Due to its involvement in varied neuromodulatory processes, the chemokine-ligand/receptor-network {{is a key}} element of secondary lesion cascades induced by SCI. This review will provide a synopsis of chemokine-ligand/receptor-expression along the whole neuraxis after traumatic spinal cord (sc) insults on basis of recent in vivo and in vitro findings in a SCI paradigm of thoracic force-defined impact lesions (Infinite Horizon Impactor) in adult rats. Analyses of chemokine-ligand/receptor-expression at defined time points after sc lesion of different severity grades or sham operation revealed that these inflammatory mediators are induced in distinct anatomical sc regions and in thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal grey, and hippocampal structures in the brain. Cellular and anatomical expression profiles together with colocalization/expression of neural stem/progenitor cell markers in adult sc stem cells niches or with pain-related receptors and mediators in <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns,</b> <b>dorsal</b> columns, and pain-processing brain areas support the notion that chemokines are involved in distinct cascades underlying clinical posttraumatic impairments and syndromes.

25|$|This {{effect of}} {{descending}} inhibition {{can be shown}} by electrically stimulating the periaqueductal grey area of the midbrain. The periaqueductal grey in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the nucleus raphes magnus which also receives similar afferents from the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NPG). In turn the nucleus raphe magnus projects to the substantia gelatinosa region of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The periaqueductal grey also contains opioid receptors which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as morphine and diacetylmorphine exhibit an analgesic effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E
25|$|The trigeminal nucleus extends {{throughout}} the brainstem, from the midbrain to the medulla, continuing into the cervical cord (where it merges with the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> {{cells of the}} spinal cord). The nucleus {{is divided into three}} parts, visible in microscopic sections of the brainstem. From caudal to rostral (ascending from the medulla to the midbrain), they are the spinal trigeminal, the principal sensory and the mesencephalic nuclei. The parts of the trigeminal nucleus receive different types of sensory information; the spinal trigeminal nucleus receives pain-temperature fibers, the principal sensory nucleus receives touch-position fibers and the mesencephalic nucleus receives proprioceptor and mechanoreceptor fibers from the jaws and teeth.|$|E
40|$|Migraine can be {{triggered}} by systemic administration of the nitric oxide (NO) donor nitroglycerin (NTG) and by abrupt falls in plasma oestradiol. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) present in superficial <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> is thought {{to play a role}} in sensitization of central nociceptors, a phenomen present in migraineurs. We therefore examined in rats the expression of CamKII in the caudal trigeminal nucleus (TNC) after subcutaneous NTG (10 mg/kg) and its modulation by oestrogen. In male rats and in ovariectomized females, after 4 h NTG increased significantly CamKII expression in the superficial layers of TNC, but not in the upper thoracic spinal cord. NTG had no effect on CamKII expression in oestradiol-treated ovariectomized animals. Thus NTG, i. e. NO, selectively enhances CamKII in the rat TNC and oestradiol blocks this effect. These data may help to understand the mechanisms by which NO triggers migraine attacks and oestrogens influence migraine severity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Burn-induced neuropathic pain is complex, and fat {{grafting}} {{has reportedly}} improved neuro-pathic pain. However, {{the mechanism of}} fat grafting in improving neuropathic pain is unclear. Previous investigations have found that neuroinflammation causes neuropathic pain, and anti-inflammatory targeting may provide potential therapeutic opportunities in neu-ropathic pain. We hypothesized that fat grafting in burn scars improves the neuropathic pain through anti-inflammation. Burn-induced scar pain was confirmed using a mechanical response test 4 weeks after burn injuries, and autologous fat grafting in the scar area was performed simultaneously. After 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and specimens were collected for the inflammation test, including COX- 2, iNOS, and nNOS in the injured skin and spinal cord <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> through immunohistochemistry and Western assays.

5000|$|In [...] "central sensitization," [...] {{nociceptive}} neurons in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of {{the spinal}} cord become sensitized by peripheral tissue damage or inflammation. This type of sensitization has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism for chronic pain conditions. The changes of central sensitization occur after repeated trials to pain. Research from animals has consistently shown that when a trial is repeatedly exposed to a painful stimulus, the animal’s pain threshold will change and result in a stronger pain response. Researchers {{believe that there are}} parallels that can be drawn between these animal trials and persistent pain in people. For example, after a back surgery that removed a herniated disc from causing a pinched nerve, the patient may still continue to “feel” pain. Also, newborns who are circumcised without anesthesia have shown tendencies to react more greatly to future injections, vaccinations, and other similar procedures. The responses of these children are an increase in crying and a greater hemodynamic response (tachycardia and tachypnea).|$|R
25|$|As noxious pain is sustained, spinal {{sensitization}} creates transcriptional {{changes in}} the neurons of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> that lead to altered function for extended periods. Mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores results from persistent synaptic activity and leads {{to the release of}} glutamate, ATP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Activated astrocytes are also a source of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which induces pro-IL-1β cleavage and sustains astrocyte activation. In this chronic signaling pathway, p38 is activated as a result of IL-1β signaling, and there is a presence of chemokines that trigger their receptors to become active. In response to nerve damage, heat shock proteins (HSP) are released and can bind to their respective TLRs, leading to further activation.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck). However, there is no symmetrical distribution found between trigger zones and sites of referred sensation.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM show {{scratching}} behavior. [...] Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers {{is a sign}} of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horn</b> region of the spine. [...] If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. [...] If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. [...] Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} sensitization {{of the central}} nervous system {{at the level of the}} spinal cord is different from the one in the thalamus. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its receptor are the molecules that seem to be responsible for the sensitization of neurons in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> of the spinal cord. Macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the spinal cord, for example, because of injury, and release TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory molecules. [...] TNF-alpha then binds to the TNF receptors expressed on nociceptors, activating the MAPK/NF-kappa B pathways. This leads to the production of more TNF-alpha, its release, and binding to the receptors on the cells that released it (autocrine signalling). This mechanism also explains the perpetuation of sensitization and thus allodynia. TNF-alpha might also increase the number of AMPA receptors, and decrease the numbers of GABA receptors on the membrane of nociceptors, both of which could change the nociceptors in a way that allows for their easier activation. [...] Another outcome of the increased TNF-alpha is the release of PGE2, with a mechanism and effect similar to the ones in the thalamus.|$|R
40|$|L-Acetylcarnitine (LAC, 100 mg/kg, s. c.), a drug {{commonly}} {{used for the}} treatment of painful neuropathies, substantially reduced mechanical allodynia in rats subjected to monolateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and also attenuated acute thermal pain in intact rats. In both cases, induction of analgesia required repeated injections of LAC, suggesting that the drug induces plastic changes within the nociceptive pathway. In both CCI- and sham-operated rats, a 24 -day treatment with LAC increased the expression of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors 2 and 3 in the lumbar segment of the spinal cord, without changing the expression of mGlu 1 a or - 5 receptors. A similar up-regulation of mGlu 2 / 3 receptors was detected in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> and <b>dorsal</b> root ganglia of intact rats treated with LAC for 5 - 7 days, a time sufficient for the induction of thermal analgesia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LAC treatment enhanced mGlu 2 / 3 immunoreactivity in the inner part of lamina II and in laminae III and IV of the spinal cord. An increased mGlu 2 / 3 receptor expression was also observed in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus or cerebellum of LAC-treated animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction combined with Northern blot analysis showed that repeated LAC injections selectively induced mGlu 2 mRNA in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>horns</b> and cerebral cortex (but not in the hippocampus). mGlu 3 mRNA levels did not change in any brain region of LAC-treated animals. To examine whether the selective up-regulation of mGlu 2 receptors had any role in LAC-induced analgesia, we have used the novel compound LY 341495, which is a potent and systemically active mGlu 2 / 3 receptor antagonist. LAC-induced analgesia was largely reduced 45 to 75 min after a single injection of LY 341495 (1 mg/kg, i. p.) in both CCI rats tested for mechanical allodynia and intact rats tested for thermal pain. We conclude that LAC produces analgesia against chronic pain produced not only by peripheral nerve injury but also by acute pain in intact animals and that LAC-induced analgesia is associated with and causally related to a selective up-regulation of mGlu 2 receptors. This offers the first example of a selective induction of mGlu 2 receptors and discloses a novel mechanism for drug-induced analgesia...|$|R
