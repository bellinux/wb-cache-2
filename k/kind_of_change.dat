5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E

They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

[...] In 1966, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) {{proposed}} the term [...] "climatic change" [...] to encompass {{all forms of}} climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years, regardless of cause. [...] Change was a given and climatic {{was used as an}} adjective to describe this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> (as opposed to political or economic change). When it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate, the term climate change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause. Climate change was incorporated in the title of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change, used as a noun, became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather.|$|E

To achieve this goal the study addresses the following questions: What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> occurs in general marketing strategy in periods of economic crisis? What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> occurs in marketing communications in periods of economic crisis? What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> occurs in product strategy in periods of economic crisis? What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> occurs in pricing strategy in periods of economic crisis? The conclusions are based on a nationwide survey, conducted in August- September 2011, as well as on analysis of secondary data for the period 2008 - 2011. The research, on which the present paper is based, attempts to answer the question: to what extent the economic crisis can be treated as a deterrent to the marketing activities of the companies operating in Bulgaria, or it can be seen as an incentive to marketing innovation. The findings provide valuable insights for marketing researchers and managers of Bulgarian companies in times of economic crisis.

For BKs, all prejudices and ill-feelings are seen as arising from identifying the self and others based on external labels like race, religion, gender, nationality, beauty (or lack of), etc. However, when there is the practice of finding the intrinsic goodness in each one, the prejudice based on those labels is replaced by the vision of one Spiritual Parent, one Human family, and universal spiritual values such as respect, love, peace and happiness.

In its wake, Jews no longer formed the majority in Palestine, and the Jewish center moved to the Galilee." [...] The third event was the 'ascension' of Constantine the Great in 312 and Christianity becoming the official state religion of Rome in 391.

During all the modifications that ensued, useless parts were reduced or suppressed, owing to the absence of selection and the principle of economy of growth; and thus at each fresh adaptation some rudiments of old structures were re-developed, but not unfrequently in a different form and for a distinct purpose.|$|E
