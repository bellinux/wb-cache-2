25|$|The {{summer of}} 1998 brought {{an abrupt end}} to the {{championship}} era. Krause felt that the Bulls {{were on the verge}} of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small <b>forward,</b> <b>power</b> forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.|$|E
500|$|When {{he first}} became {{a free agent}} in 1996, Howard was {{described}} as versatile enough to play all three front-line positions (small <b>forward,</b> <b>power</b> forward and center), and Michael Jordan praised his [...] "game, work ethic and character". [...] As a Dallas player in 2000–01, he was still regarded as a versatile offensive player who could [...] "take advantage of smaller defenders in the paint and then stretch his bigger defenders outside" [...] {{in addition to being}} a solid rebounder. [...] By 2001, Lacy J. Banks from the Chicago Sun-Times regarded him as a high-priced, under-achieving player, [...] but in 2002, Banks described him as a solid veteran at the four (power forward position). In the NBA, Howard developed a respected inside post-up game and a reputation as a veteran leader, according to Kiki Vandeweghe, the general manager of the Denver Nuggets, Howard's team in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the players}} have been {{introduced}} in the following order: small <b>forward,</b> <b>power</b> forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. Thus during the championship era, Scottie Pippen was usually the first (or second) Bulls player introduced, and Michael Jordan the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with Derrick Rose's arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. [...] Although internal disputes {{eventually led to the}} dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of Tommy Edwards as the announcer.|$|E
