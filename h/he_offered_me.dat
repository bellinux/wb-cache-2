When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. <b>He</b> <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but I wanted him {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> {{his hand}} as he climbed up into the dog-cart, which I pretended, however, not to see.|$|E
