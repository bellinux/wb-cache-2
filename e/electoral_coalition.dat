5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition</b> that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E
5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition</b> that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E

The CD/N-VA had an electoral program that emphasized the need for far-reaching state reform. Yves Leterme of the CD personally gained 800,000 votes and {{was considered to be}} the prospective prime minister. The SP.a, the party that lost the most seats, declared it would prepare itself for a role in the opposition, and would support state reform from that position.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{disintegration of}} the FSN produced several political parties including the Romanian Democrat Social Party (PDSR, later Social Democratic Party, PSD), the Democratic Party (PD) and the ApR (Alliance for Romania). The PDSR party governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then {{there have been three}} democratic changes of government: in 1996, the democratic-liberal opposition and its leader Emil Constantinescu acceded to power; in 2000 the Social Democrats returned to power, with Iliescu once again president; and in 2004 Traian Băsescu was elected president, with an <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition</b> called Justice and Truth Alliance (DA). The government was formed by a larger coalition which also includes the Conservative Party and the ethnic Hungarian party.|$|E
25|$|Bujor rallied {{with the}} Poporanist movement, infiltrating the National Liberal Party from the left. He {{was among the}} founders of the leading Poporanist review, Viața Românească, but {{expelled}} after expressing disagreement with its refusal to criticize the National Liberal mainstream. As an independent left-winger, constantly pushing for land reform and universal suffrage, Bujor had publicized and sometimes violent conflicts with his far-right colleague at university, A. C. Cuza. Elected to Senate as a university representative, and serving throughout the social upheaval of World War I, Bujor clashed with the National Liberal Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu, whom he accused of bringing disaster upon the country. In 1919, {{he was one of the}} founders and leaders of Peasants' Party, which became part of a successful <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition,</b> representing groups throughout Greater Romania; Bujor was selected as Greater Romania's first president of the Senate.|$|E
40|$|We analyze how {{religion}} affects {{voting and}} redistribution. Our model directs {{attention away from}} the particular faith, belief or risk attitudes of religious individuals, and emphasizes instead how organized religion opens the door to standard group-based distributive politics. We argue that organized religion makes it possible for the rich and the religious poor to form <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions</b> in favor of low taxes and limited redistribution. Such <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions</b> form out of simple material self-interest, and they occur {{at the expense of the}} secular poor. However, the material reward to the religious poor from supporting such <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions</b> depends on the institutional context. As state support for religion increases, poor religious voters have greater incentives to vote with poor secular voters in favor of parties that support high taxes. The analysis therefore highlights the possibilities of understanding how religion affects politics without asserting that religious individuals differ systematically from secular ones in their values or preferences...|$|R

The newly formed Catholic {{conservative}} Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas or CEDA) gained 115 seats and the Radicals 102. The right capitalised on disenchantment with the government among Catholics and other conservatives. [...] CEDA campaigned on reversing the reforms {{that had been made}} under the Republic, and on freeing political prisoners. [...] Anarchists favoured abstention from the vote. These factors helped the election to result in significant victory for the right over the left.|$|E

In June 1930 the new Navarrese junta with Rodezno its member was set up, an attempt to enforce more {{cautious}} policy towards Basque nationalism and to shift focus from foral to religious issues. The move might have backfired following declaration of the Republic, as the Carlists decided to forge <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition</b> with PNV; when concluded as “lista católico-fuerista” it enabled Rodezno, elected from Navarre, to resume his parliamentary career in 1931.
