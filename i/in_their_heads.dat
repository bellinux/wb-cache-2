25|$|Death {{appears in}} every novel except The Wee Free Men and Snuff, {{although}} sometimes {{with only a}} few lines. As dictated by tradition, he is a seven-foot-tall skeleton in a black robe who sits astride a pale horse (called Binky). His dialogue is always depicted in , and without quotation marks, as several characters state that Death's voice seems to arrive <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> without actually passing through their ears as sound.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, some {{of those}} who had fled {{returned}} to the smoking ruins of their village. None of the bodies in the houses could be identified; many of the others who had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because many of the charred corpses had already been partially devoured by dogs and other animals.|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} going to put their penalty in order to get <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E

25|$|Slipper {{lobsters}} {{have six}} segments <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and eight segments in the thorax, which are collectively {{covered in a}} thick carapace. The six segments of the abdomen each bear a pair of pleopods, while the thoracic appendages are either walking legs or maxillipeds. The head segments bear various mouthparts and two pairs of antennae. The first antennae, or antennules, are held on a long flexible stalk, and are used for sensing the environment. The second antennae are the slipper lobsters' most conspicuous feature, as they are expanded and flattened into large plates that extend horizontally forward from the animal's head.|$|E
25|$|Maya rituals {{differ from}} region to region, but many similar {{patterns}} in ceremonies, whether being performed for {{individual or group}} need, have been noted. First, all rituals are preceded by foresight of a medicine man, who determines {{the day of the}} ceremony through calendrical divination. The medicine men of the Ixil Maya of Guatemala, who kept track of days <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> would lay out red seeds from the coral tree onto the pre-Columbian calendar to count them and figure out what day best suited the specific ritual. As a symbol of a spiritual purification, the individual or individuals would observe a fasting and abstinence period before the ritual day.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a fine}} {{thing that}} a man astride two wheels can, in a six-day race, {{distance}} a hound, horse, or a locomotive. It confirms the assumption, no longer much contested, that the human animal is superior to the other animals. But this undisputed thing is being said in too solemn and painful way at Madison Square Garden. An athletic contest in which participants 'go queer' <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport. It is brutality. Days and weeks of recuperation {{will be needed to}} put the Garden racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.|$|E

25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E
500|$|Twin Earth shows this, {{according}} to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything {{is identical to}} Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ whereas those of earth are filled with H2O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word [...] "water", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word [...] "water" [...] when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content.|$|E
500|$|In 1798, Methodist ministers {{arrived in}} Hinde's {{neighborhood}} {{and began to}} convert people. Susanna, one of Hinde's daughters, converted, causing distress to the family. Hinde banished her from his home, {{and she went to}} live with her aunt forty miles away. However, this failed because the aunt had already converted, and Hinde's wife converted soon after. Hinde became convinced that the disorder was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> and treated them with medical procedures of the day, such as a [...] "blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine, which he left on for several days". Drake states that, through this [...] "measure of violence, he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship". The procedures were painful, but his wife stated afterwards that [...] "it was a punishment, but I never was so happy in all my life". Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife, and he converted to Methodism. His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly. Two of his daughters married traveling preachers, and another daughter converted to Methodism too. By the end of his life, Hinde was a devout Methodist. According to one account: ...|$|E

2500|$|Morse code {{speed is}} {{measured}} in words per minute (wpm) or characters per minute (cpm). Characters have differing lengths because they contain differing numbers of dots and dashes. [...] Consequently, words also have different lengths in terms of dot duration, even when they contain {{the same number of}} characters. [...] For this reason, a standard word is helpful to measure operator transmission speed. [...] "PARIS" [...] and [...] "CODEX" [...] are two such standard words.

2500|$|A white-eyed [...] "albino" [...] {{horn fly}} was {{discovered}} in a colony maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory in Kerrville, Texas. This is apparently a spontaneous mutation, as tests including crosses were performed that determined the white-eye mutation was not sex-linked and the white-eyed flies actually have decreased amounts of eye pigment present within the head. This {{appears to be an}} inherited simple Mendelian autosomal recessive with complete penetrance. A colony of white-eyed horn flies was established from this single individual and has been maintained in the laboratory as visible genetic markers such as an eye color mutation in an economically important species like the horn fly may be useful for behavior and population dynamic studies, as well as release and recapture studies. No other differences from the wild-type flies were detected in the external characteristics of the mutant phenotype or in egg viability. However, white-eyed flies had significantly lower amounts of the pigment dihydroxyxanthommatin <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> suggesting either the lack of xanthommatin production, or a failure of transport and storage within the head of the mutant phenotype.|$|E
