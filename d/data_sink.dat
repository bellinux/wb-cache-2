40|$|Abstract—While many {{protocols}} for {{sensor network}} security provide confidentiality for {{the content of}} messages, contextual information usually remains exposed. Such contextual information can be exploited by an adversary to derive sensitive information such as the locations of monitored objects and <b>data</b> <b>sinks</b> in the field. Attacks on these components can significantly undermine any network application. Existing techniques defend the leakage of location information from a limited adversary who can only observe network traffic in a small region. However, a stronger adversary, the global eavesdropper, is realistic and can defeat these existing techniques. This paper first formalizes the location privacy issues in sensor networks under this strong adversary model and computes a lower bound on the communication overhead needed for achieving a given level of location privacy. The paper then proposes two techniques to provide location privacy to monitored objects (source location privacy) – periodic collection and source simulation – and two techniques to provide location privacy to <b>data</b> <b>sinks</b> (sink location privacy) – sink simulation and backbone flooding. These techniques provide trade-offs between privacy, communication cost, and latency.

40|$|Abstract — In multi-hop {{wireless}} sensor {{networks that}} are characterized by many-to-one (convergecast) traffic patterns, problems related to energy imbalance among sensors often appear. When the transmission range is fixed for nodes throughout the network, the amount of traffic that sensors are required to forward increases dramatically as {{the distance to the}} <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> becomes smaller. Thus, sensors closest to the <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> tend to die early, leaving areas of the network completely unmonitored and causing network partitions. Alternatively, if all sensors transmit directly to the <b>data</b> <b>sink,</b> the furthest nodes from the <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> will die much more quickly than those close to the sink. Network lifetime can be improved to a limited extent by the use of a more intelligent transmission power control policy that balances the energy used in each node by requiring nodes further from the <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> to transmit over longer distances (although not directly to the <b>data</b> <b>sink).</b> However, transmission power control alone is not enough to solve the hot spot problem.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{are made}} of spatially distributed autonomous sensors, which cooperate to monitor physical or environmental parameters and to deliver such data {{to one or more}} <b>data</b> <b>sinks.</b> A promising field of application of WSNs is planetary exploration, characterized by a continuous monitoring of the surface to have clear notion of planet conditions and prepare for future manned missions. The potentially large size of the region to be monitored and the line-of-sight limitations (as, for instance, on the Moon, which is the case study discussed in the paper) hamper the possibility of having 1 -hop sensor-sink communications. Therefore, to allow sensed data to reach the sink(s), the sensors must be able to create and maintain a multi-hop ad hoc network. This paper proposes an ad hoc routing algorithm applicable to WSNs for planetary exploration, aiming at (i) assuring any-cast communications with multiple <b>data</b> <b>sinks,</b> (ii) minimizing the control overhead for routing maintenance, (iii) being light in terms of memory/computational requirements, to be installed into low-power and low-memory/processing devices, (iv) being rapid to reconfigure in the presence of node failures and (v) optimizing the choice of the paths, to achieve energy balancing and saving.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multihop}} wireless sensor {{networks that}} are often characterized by many-to-one (convergecast) traffic patterns, problems related to energy imbalance among sensors often appear. Sensors closer to a <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> are usually required to forward {{a large amount of}} traffic for sensors farther from the <b>data</b> <b>sink.</b> Therefore, these sensors tend to die early, leaving areas of the network completely unmonitored and reducing the functional network lifetime. In our study, we explore possible sensor network deployment strategies that maximize sensor network lifetime by mitigating the problem of the hot spot around the <b>data</b> <b>sink.</b> Strategies such as variable-range transmission power control with optimal traffic distribution, mobile-data-sink deployment, multiple-data-sink deployment, nonuniform initial energy assignment, and intelligent sensor/relay deployment are investigated. We suggest a general model to analyze and evaluate these strategies. In this model, we not only discover how to maximize the network lifetime given certain network constraints but also consider the factor of extra costs involved in more complex deployment strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the maximum achievable sensor network lifetime for different deployment strategies, and it also provides practical cost-efficient sensor network deployment guidelines.

40|$|The {{success of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{depends largely on}} {{efficient}} information delivery from target areas toward data sinks. The problem of data forwarding {{is complicated by the}} severe energy constraints of sensors in WSNs. In this work, we propose and analyze a data forwarding scheme, termed Multi-hop/Direct Forwarding (MDF), for WSNs where sensor nodes forward data traffic toward a common <b>data</b> <b>sink.</b> In the MDF scheme, a node splits out-going traffic into at most two branches: one is sent to a node that is h units away; the other is sent directly to the <b>data</b> <b>sink.</b> The value of h is chosen to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. The direct transmission is employed to balance the energy consumption of nodes at different locations and to avoid the so-called “hot spot ” problem in data forwarding. In order to calculate its traffic splitting ratio, a node only needs to know the distance toward the common <b>data</b> <b>sink</b> and that of the farthest node.

We propose a distributed TDMA scheduling protocol specifically designed for data aggregation called RandSched. RandSched tests whether the transmissions of different sets of nodes succeed simultaneously and only assigns the same slot to them if they have been proved to tolerate each other’s interference. By constructing and testing the schedule incrementally, RandSched is more likely to obtain a collision-free schedule than existing algorithms, which is particularly important in large networks. This is confirmed by our simulations, which also reveal a low scheduling overhead and a reduced transmission latency.
