40|$|Objectives: To compare {{pregnancy}} {{rate and}} number of embryos 30 days post mating in gilts group-housed in pens of three and <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> individually in gestation stalls. Other potential indicators of swine welfare examined included body weight, backfat thickness, lesions, lameness, display of stereotypies, and serum cortisol concentrations. Methods: After artificial insemination, Yorkshire × Landrace gilts were placed in gestation stalls (n = 14) or pens of three gilts each (n = 14 pens, 42 gilts) until 30 days post mating. Measures of welfare and performance assessed before mating and days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 post mating were compared between treatment groups. Gilts were euthanized and reproductive tracts were examined on day 30. Results: Group-housed gilts gained more body weight than <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> in stalls, but backfat thickness was similar between treatments. The proportion of gilts exhibiting stereotypies on day 28 was not affected by treatment. Lesion scores (0 to 5; 5 = severe) were higher for group-housed gilts and were highest during the first 7 days post mating. On day 30, lameness scores (0 to 5; 5 = severe) were higher in group-housed gilts, and serum cortisol concentration was higher in stall-housed gilts. Pregnancy rate on day 30 was lower for group-housed gilts. The numbers of ovulations and embryos, embryo weight, and crown-rump length were similar between groups. Implications: Indicators of welfare were differentially affected by type of gestation housing, and pregnancy rate was higher in <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> individually in stalls...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the efficiency of detecting oestrus in gilts, using the back pressure test (BPT), will be reduced when <b>gilts</b> are <b>housed</b> adjacent to a boar of high sexual motivation compared to when <b>gilts</b> are <b>housed</b> adjacent to a boar of low sexual motivation. The experiment was a 2 x 2 Latin square design with three replicates. Boars of high and low sexual motivation were {{selected on the basis of}} the total number of copulations and the mean reaction time to first mount during three mating tests. Twelve boars were observed in mating tests and the three highest and lowest ranking boars were assigned to three palm, each pair containing a boar of high and a boar of low sexual motivation. One pair was used in each replicate. In each replicate, two groups of six ovariectomised <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> for 14 days, commencing 7 days prior to hormonally induced destrus, adjacent to a boar of either high or low sexual motivation. All gilts were checked twice daily for oestrus using the BPT. In the first replicate, the level of proceptive behaviour of the gilts was quantified immediately after checking for oestrus in a 3 -rain test in which the amount of time that the gilts spent within 0. 5 m of a pen containing a sexually mature boar was recorded. There were no effects of <b>housing</b> <b>gilts</b> adjacent to boars of high or low sexual motivation on the percentage of gilts detected in oestrus, the percentage of gilts detected in oestrus for more than I day, the duration of oestrus or the level of proceptive behaviour of gilts. These data suggest that the level of sexual motivation of boars does not influence the efficiency of detecting hormonally induced oestrus, using the BPT, in ovariectomised <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> adjacent to boars...|$|R
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} on pigs have {{demonstrated}} {{a relationship between}} the degree of resistance displayed early in life in a so-called backtest and a variety of behavioural and physiological responses in piglets and young fattening pigs. To study whether pigs with diverging responses in the backtest, i. e., high-resisting (HR) and low-resisting (LR) pigs, differ also in adulthood in their responses to an acute stressor, adult nulliparous HR (n= 36) and LR <b>gilts</b> (n= 36) <b>housed</b> in groups or stalls were challenged by 5 -min fixation with a nose sling. During the first minute of restraint, HR gilts vocalised significantly more than LR gilts. Over the whole 5 -min period, HR gilts tended to vocalise more than LR <b>gilts.</b> <b>Housing</b> or backtest type did not affect immediate cortisol increase ((- 5 min; 15 min)). At t= 45 min, cortisol concentrations in HR gilts but not in LR gilts were still higher than at t=- 5 min. Heart rate quickly decreased during the first min of restraint and remained fairly constant thereafter. Estimated heart rate after 5 min of nose sling was significantly lower in HR gilts compared to LR <b>gilts.</b> <b>Housing</b> or backtest type did not affect heart rate variability indices.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the welfare and productivity of gestating gilts in groups with the electronic sow feeding (ESF) system compared to conventional stalls. A total of 83 <b>gilts</b> (Yorkshire×Landrace) were <b>housed</b> into individual stalls to be artificially inseminated. Gilts confirmed pregnant were introduced to their treatment, conventional stalls (ST) or groups with the ESF system. All gilts {{were taken to the}} farrowing crates one week prior to their expected farrowing date. In the gestation period, {{there were no significant differences}} between gilts allocated to ST and ESF on growth performance. However, backfat thickness gain (p = 0. 08) and body condition score (BCS) at 110 days of gestation (p = 0. 10) tended to be higher in ESF gilts than ST. Likewise, <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> in group showed significantly higher estimated body muscle contents at 110 days of gestation (p = 0. 02) and body muscle change during gestation (p = 0. 01). There was a trend for a shorter parturition time in ESF gilts (p = 0. 07). In the lactation period, group <b>housed</b> <b>gilts</b> showed a tendency to increased BCS changes (p = 0. 06). Reproductive performance did not differ with the exception of piglet mortality (ST = 0. 2 no. of piglets vs ESF = 0. 4 no. of piglets; p = 0. 01). In blood profiles, ST gilts showed a higher cortisol level at 110 days of gestation (p = 0. 01). Weaning to estrus interval was shorter in <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> in ESF than ST (p = 0. 01). In locomotory behaviors, ESF gilts recorded a tendency to elevate locomotion score at 36, 70, and 110 days of gestation (p = 0. 07, p = 0. 06, and p = 0. 06, respectively). Similarly, ESF gilts showed significantly higher incidence of scratches at 36, 70, and 110 days of gestation (p = 0. 01). Moreover, farrowing rates were higher in stall treatment (97. 6 %) compare to group housing treatment (95. 2 %). In conclusion, while group <b>housed</b> <b>gilts</b> with ESF system positively affected welfare status in combination with less physiologically stressful environments and activity, it negatively effects piglet mortality, farrowing rates and injuries of gilts...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{castration}} of male pigs is {{a practice}} that will probably be abandoned in Europe in the future because of general protest against pain in animals and a growing concern on (farm) animal welfare. Rearing entire males will therefore inevitably be integrated in the pig sector. In the present study, possible differences in behavior, production results and meat quality between entire males and <b>gilts,</b> both <b>housed</b> in single-sex groups but with visual contact to other groups, were investigated. The influence of {{the location of the}} pen (next to a group of the same sex or next to a group of the opposite sex) was also looked at. A total of 141 hybrid pigs – 70 entire males and 71 gilts – heterozygous for the halothane gene, were observed from 18 to 24 weeks of age. During this period, boars were more active than gilts and displayed more aggression and mounting behavior. Housing boars next to a pen with gilts increased explorative and drinking behavior. <b>Gilts</b> <b>housed</b> next to a boar pen tended to show less inactivity.

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{response of}} piglets in a backtest {{early in life}} seems indicative of their coping strategy at a later age. Coping characteristics may depend on the interaction between backtest classification and housing conditions. We studied whether growth rate and partitioning of energy in adult gilts were related to response in the backtest early in life, and to housing in groups or individual stalls. During the suckling period, female piglets were subjected to the backtest. Each piglet was restrained on its back for 1 min, {{and the number of}} escape attempts was scored. Thirty-six high-resisting gilts and 36 low-resisting gilts were selected. After weaning, pigs were housed in 12 groups of six (three high-resisting and three low-resisting). From 7 mo of age onward, 36 gilts out of six groups were housed in individual stalls, whereas the other <b>gilts</b> remained group <b>housed.</b> At 13 mo of age, <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in clusters of three (three high-resisting or three low-resisting) for an experimental period of 7 d in climatic respiration chambers. Group-housed <b>gilts</b> were loose <b>housed,</b> and stall-housed <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in stalls within the chamber. Despite the fact that high-resisting and low-resisting gilts did not differ (P = 0. 269) in initial BW, low-resisting gilts showed a higher (P = 0. 039) ADG during the experimental period in association with a higher (P = 0. 043) energy metabolizability. This suggests that, in line with the theory on coping strategies, high-resisting gilts may have more difficulties in adapting to a change in environment, (i. e., the change from home pen to climatic chamber). Group-and stall-housed gilts differed (P = 0. 001) in initial BW, with group-housed gilts being heavier. During the experimental period, stall-housed gilts showed lower energy metabolizability (P = 0. 001), lower energy retention (P = 0. 001), and a higher energy requirement for maintenance (P = 0. 001) due to a higher activity-related heat production (P = 0. 001). This finding suggests that stall housing might have a negative influence on performance and partitioning of energy when animals are adapting to a change in their environment...|$|R

40|$|Contents To achieve optimal {{reproductive}} performance in pig herds, sows {{need to become}} pregnant {{as soon as possible}} after weaning. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate herd and management factors associated with {{reproductive performance}} of sows after weaning. A questionnaire pertaining to sow management at weaning and herd reproductive data were collected from 76 randomly selected commercial pig herds in Belgium. Associations between the herd factors and two reproductive parameters after weaning (weaning-to-oestrous interval: WEI and percentage of repeat breeders: RB) were analysed using general linear mixed models. A separated feeding strategy of breeding gilts from 60 kg onwards was significantly associated with a shorter WEI (5. 54 vs 7. 28 days; p= 0. 040). Factors significantly associated with a lower percentage of RB were housing the newly weaned sows separated from the gestating sows (7 % vs 12 %; p= 0. 003), using semen< 4 days after collection (79 vs 14 %; p= 0. 014) and stimulating oestrus twice a day (8 vs 11 %; p= 0. 025). In conclusion, some management practices, such as feeding strategy of breeding <b>gilts,</b> <b>housing</b> conditions of sows, method of oestrous stimulation and storage duration of semen, have an influence on the outcome of reproductive parameters such as weaning-to-oestrous interval and percentage of repeat breeders. These practices can be implemented rather easily by pig producers and may consequently lead to improvements of reproductive performance of sows after weaning...|$|R

Gilts were randomly allotted to three corn-soybean diets formulated to provide three standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine concentrations. Gilts received grower diets formulated to provide 0. 68 % (low), 0. 79 % (medium) or 0. 90 % (high) SID lysine from 100 days of age until approximately 90 kg BW. Then, gilts were fed finisher diets containing 0. 52 % (low), 0. 60 % (medium) or 0. 68 % (high) SID lysine until they were moved to the breeding barn at approximately 220 days of ageData on BW, bakfat thickness, loin area, feed and lysine intake and age at puberty was collected at different intervals during the study. Gilts fed the low lysine diet had lower average daily gain, body weight, backfat thickness and loin depth compared with gilts fed the high lysine diet. Overall, 34 % of gilts displayed standing estrus before 220 days of age. The number of gilts that reached puberty was not different among dietary treatments; however, gilts fed the high and medium lysine diet reached puberty 10 days and 6 days before gilts fed the low lysine diet, respectively.

There {{were no differences}} between lysine or ME levels for growth and body composition, except for back fat, which was slightly greater for gilts fed a HME diet (~ 2 mm). Gilts fed HME diets had a lower FI but a greater ME intake compared with gilts fed LME.

Feed intake of gilts increased as the space allowance decreased but no effect was observed in barrows (p< 0. 05 for the interaction). However, no interaction was observed for average daily gain or feed-to-gain ratio. Barrows had 2. 4 % less (p< 0. 01) carcass lean percentage but 9 % more (p< 0. 05) intramuscular fat content than gilts. The concentration of linoleic acid in the outer layer of backfat was higher (p< 0. 05) for gilts than for barrows when pigs were allocated at 0. 84 m 2 /pig, but no differences were observed at 0. 76 m 2 /pig. Also, barrows had 2. 7 % more (p< 0. 05) total saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the outer layer of backfat and lower monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (p< 0. 01) and linoleic acid (p< 0. 05) content in the inner layer than <b>gilts.</b> <b>Housing</b> density did not affect any of the carcass quality traits studied but an increase in space allowance decreased (p< 0. 05) MUFA content in both layers.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-parturient primiparous pigs (<b>gilts)</b> <b>housed</b> in behaviourally restrictive farrowing crates without straw redirect their nest-building behaviour to non-manipulable substrates such as the bars of the crate. These gilts also show elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels, particularly around the peak of nest-building activity, when compared to gilts in larger pens that have been provided with a manipulable substrate (straw). It remains unclear whether these behavioural and physiological responses to crating result from the lack of a suitable nesting substrate or from the restricted space. This study investigated the effects of space (crate [C] versus pen [P]) and straw (straw [S] versus no straw [NS]) using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Thirty-four gilts were implanted with an indwelling jugular catheter at around 12 days before parturition. They were moved to one of the four environments five days before parturition, and blood sampling and recording of behaviour were carried out during the pre-parturient period. Penned gilts (P), irrespective of straw availability, spent more time standing and walking and performed more total substrate-directed behaviour than crated (C) gilts. When straw was not available to penned gilts, a large proportion of their substrate-directed behaviour was redirected to the floor. Space also had an effect on ACTH and cortisol levels across the entire pre-parturient phase, with C gilts having higher levels than (P) gilts irrespective of straw availability, but particularly so at the peak of nest-building activity. There was no effect of straw on ACTH or cortisol levels. Overall, it appears that increased space, perhaps through allowing locomotion, increases substrate-directed behaviour of pre-parturient gilts. When space is available but straw is absent, pre-parturient gilts redirect their nest-building behaviour to the floor. The ability to express substrate-directed behaviour as a result of increased space is reflected in lower levels of indicators of physiological stres...|$|R

40|$|Half of Sweden’s 140 000 - 150 000 sows are culled and {{replaced}} by 75 000 gilts annually. Culling of old sows is necessary and allows new breeding material to enter the herd. However, many of the culled sows are young, and have not yet become profitable at the time for culling. Therefore, {{it is an important}} question for the pig industry, how to raise gilts to sows with a high and sustainable production level. Several rearing factors are thought to influence the reproductive performance as well as the longevity of the sow. However, it is not well studied in which way these factors act. This thesis aims to find relationships between rearing factors and the performance of sows, so that a suitable way of raising gilts can be proposed. As a part of this work a study was performed, with the purpose of comparing how herds with high respectively low production results and culling frequencies raised their gilts. It is also described how gilt rearing is performed and varies between herds. Data was based on an interview study and the herd monitoring program PigWin Sugg. The analysis at herd level showed that purchasing gilts was associated with a lower annual sow removal rate, compared with raising gilts on the own farm. In herds with own production of replacement gilts, the use of a breeding computer program when selecting gilts, resulted in a small proportion of litters from gilts in the farm. Herds with the highest average mating age for gilts had the highest number of live born pigs in the first litter and the herds that accepted more returns to oestrus had better longevity and most pigs born alive during lifetime of their sows. <b>Housing</b> <b>gilts</b> in pens with slatted floor and concrete during mating and pregnancy was associated with a high proportion of sows culled due to leg and claw injuries and few pigs born alive in the first litter compared with <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> on deep straw litter. However, gilts raised in pens with slatted floor and concrete between the age of 12 and 24 weeks had most live born pigs in the first litter. The crude protein content in the gilt feed did not influence the production results or culling reasons. However, a low feeding intensity gave a high proportion of sows culled due to leg and claw injuries. A high feeding intensity at mating (flushing) was associated with better longevity. Only 55 of the total contacted 125 herds participated in this study and the result showed great variations in how gilts were reared in different herds. Several other rearing factors, beyond those analysed in this paper, can be of interest to analyse in how they affect the performance of sows. To successfully raise gilts to sows with a high and sustainable production, {{it is important to consider}} already known relationships between rearing and performance. Therefore, advices in how to raise gilts (based on literature and the results from this study) are presented in the end of this paper...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{postural}} behaviour was compared between gilts kept in service unit with {{different types of}} flooring during all seasons. The study included four 28 -day production cycles and 10 gilts per cycle, equally divided into a control and an experimental group. Control <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in gestation stalls with slatted concrete floor, whereas {{in the experimental group}} the floor was covered with an adjusted rubber mat. Postural behaviour of gilts was observed 4 times per cycle for 4 hours. Study results showed that during cooler seasons, gilts in concrete stalls spent more time standing and lying sternally, whereas gilts in matted stalls were mostly lying, predominantly laterally (P< 0. 001 all). There were no significant between group differences according to the time the gilts spent sitting or the frequency of changing posture in any season observed. Nevertheless, experimental animals spent significantly less time changing standing to both lying positions during all seasons (P< 0. 01 all). In conclusion, rubber mats may improve lying comfort in gilts; however, when using rubber mats, the house thermal conditions should be taken in consideration...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of different doses (0 - 1. 25 mg/kg IM) of prostaglandin (PG) F- 2 alpha {{on the behavior of}} female pigs (Sus scrofa). Six-month-old cyclic nulliparous sows (<b>gilts)</b> were <b>housed</b> and tested individually in strawed pens (2. 8 x 1. 7 m). All doses of PGF(2 alpha) induced rooting, pawing at the ground, and gathering straw. In the hour following treatment the frequency of pawing increased with increasing dose to reach a maximum level with the highest dose given. The frequency to gather straw was highest in pigs treated with the lowest dose (0. 008 mg/kg). The frequency of oronasal contact with the floor and pen walls was unaffected by dose. Scratching, locomotion, and changes in body posture were highest following treatment with the three highest doses of PGF(2 alpha). Many of the behaviors observed following PGF(2 alpha) treatment are characteristic of prepartum nesting behavior in pregnant sows. We conclude that two key components of maternal nest-building behavior, pawing, and gathering straw, are affected differentially by different doses of PGF(2 alpha). The implications of these results on the mechanisms underlying maternal nest building in pigs are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
40|$|Osteochondrosis (OC) {{involves}} {{the development of}} necrotic growth cartilage near {{the surface of a}} joint and is suggested to be associated with lameness in sows. Development of OC in pigs occurs at young age in a relatively short time frame of several weeks around 10 weeks of age. Due to this time dependency, one may wonder whether there are time dependent effects of factors or conditions associated with OC. The aim of this thesis was to assess whether OC prevalence is associated with conditions encountered in early life such as dietary restriction, floor type, conformation and locomotive characteristics (CLC), natural (auto-) antibodies (N[A]Ab), and carbohydrate levels. Indications for time dependent effects were found for dietary restriction on OC prevalence. This indicated that gilts receiving restricted feeding from 4 to 10 weeks of age and switched to ad libitum feeding until 26 weeks of age had a significantly higher prevalence of OC when compared to gilts receiving restricted feeding after 10 weeks of age. Time dependent effects of floor type were not clearly present, but <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> on a deep litter type system using wood shavings after weaning had a higher prevalence of severe OC when compared to gilts kept on a concrete partially slatted floor. Feed with a lower carbohydrate level increased OC prevalence compared to feed with a higher carbohydrate level. We hypothesized that the effects of dietary restriction, floor type, and dietary carbohydrate levels were mediated through loading of the joints either by, respectively, a short rapid increase in weight gain, higher incidence of play behaviors, or by an overall increased body weight. Although OC has been suggested to be associated with various CLC such as lameness, a consistent association of CLC at young age with OC at slaughter could not be found. This is likely due to CLC and OC both varying over time, making associations between the 2 entities complicated.   There were indications that a component of the immune system is associated with OC as N(A) Ab against several antigens were found after weaning in association with OC. However, as with the CLC, associations with OC were not consistent over time, making it difficult to discern the exact associations between N(A) Ab and OC. To conclude, several early life conditions were found to affect or be associated with OC prevalence in gilts. This indicates that if one wants to reduce OC prevalence, one needs to start early after weaning. However, the exact implications of OC on CLC such as lameness and, therefore, welfare remain uncertain and require further studies into the long term welfare effects of OC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the welfare of gilts managed in {{different}} housing systems. The material consisted of a total of 160 gilts, weighing between 40 to 100 kg. The study was conducted in 15 pig breeding farms producing gilts in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship, Poland. The <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in facilities with access to open air (5 piggeries) and without a run (10 pig farms). The welfare of gilts was assessed using behavioral, physiological, health, and produc-tion performance criteria. The overall evaluation of welfare was based on designated control points. Summing up the results, we found a higher level of welfare in gilts kept with an access to outside runs. Behavioral responses of gilts managed without an outdoor run involved a higher rate of cases of unusual behavior and more frequent states of anxiety. The serum concentration of haptoglobin in gilts was varied in the studied conditions of living. The lowest average con-tent of Hp was recorded in gilts kept in buildings with outside runs. A higher rate of animals suf-fered a disease and injuries in the facilities without an access to outdoor runs. Under these housing conditions, frequent problems with the legs (leg lameness and deformation) was an issue. An analysis of critical control points indicates that the welfare of pigs remained at a high level...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if Yorkshire gilts become habituated to the process of weighing. A total of 192 pure bred Yorkshire gilts were used. The <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in 12 pens, 16 gilts/pen providing a space allowance of 0. 82 m 2 /gilt. Gilts were weighed every 2 -wks for a maximum of eight scores/ gilt. Gilts were scored while on the weigh scale for activity using a whole number scale of one to five (1 = calm, minimal movement; 5 = continuous rapid movement and an escape attempt) at two different time points, T = 0 (as soon as the back gate was closed and T = 15, 15 sec after the back gate was closed. Analyses were done using Proc Mixed of SAS. The differences during round one between T = 0 and T = 15 was 1 point on the 5 point scale. By round eight this had dropped down to a difference of 0. 2. During the first round over both time points the gilts scored on average 2. 5, by round 5 this had dropped down to around 1. 5 at which point it stabilized. In conclusion, Yorkshire gilts appear to become habituated to the process of weighing over the course of a trial, and as such do not seem to find the process highly aversive...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of oestrogen supplementation on PGF(2 alpha) -induced nest-building in pseudopregnant gilts. Oestradiol valerate (5 mg/day) injections were given on Days 11 - 15 of the oestrous cycle to induce pseudopregnancy. A further series of injections of either oestradiol valerate (5 mg/day) or vehicle were given on days 44 - 46 of pseudopregnancy to reflect more closely the hormone profile seen in pregnancy. Nest-building was induced by a single intramuscular injection of 15 mg of PGF(2 alpha) (Lutalyse) on Day 47 of pseudopregnancy. The <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in pens (2. 8 X 1. 7 m) containing straw in experiment I or chronically confined in crates (0. 6 X 1. 7 m) that did not contain straw on days 44 - 48 of pseudopregnancy for experiment 2,. Oestrogen supplemented gilts had significantly higher concentrations of circulating 17 beta-oestradiol on day 47 of pseudopregnancy {{but there were no}} significant differences between treatments for circulating levels of prolactin, progesterone, cortisol or oxytocin, or for any behavioural measure in either experiment. These results indicate that there is no direct effect of supplementing already pseudopregnant gilts with oestradiol valerate on PGF(2 alpha) -induced nest-building. The results also show that the pre-partum environment has a pronounced effect on nest-building behaviours and that non-pregnant pigs might be a useful model for pre-partum nest-building in this species.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of selection for reduced feed intake (RFI) on scale activity for Yorkshire gilts. A total of 192 Yorkshire gilts were used, 96 were from a line that had been selected for low residual feed intake over 5 generations (LRFI) and 96 from a randomly bred control line (CRFI). <b>Gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in 12 pens (16 gilts/pen; 0. 82 m 2 /gilt) containing 8 gilts from each line in a conventional grow-finish unit. Gilts were weighed every 2 -wks for a maximum of eight scores per gilt. Gilts were scored while on the weigh scale for activity using a whole number scale of one to five (1 = calm, minimal movement; 5 = continuous rapid movement and an escape attempt). Analyses were done using Proc Mixed of SAS. The LRFI line began with a lower scale activity score, but did not experience as great of a drop in their score as the CRFI gilts. The CRFI gilts scored lower by the end of the rounds compared to the LRFI gilts. In conclusion, selection for lower residual feed intake in purebred Yorkshires has a related effect on scale activity score but this relationship is complicated and thus warrants further research. Therefore, scale activity may not be an easy measure to be added to the list of already described traits in pigs as a factor which relates to selection for lower RFI...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of selection for reduced residual feed intake (RFI) on lesion scores in gilts in their home pen. A total of 192 gilts were used; 96 were from a line that had been selected for low residual feed intake over 5 generations (LRFI) and 96 from a randomly bred control line (CRFI). <b>Gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in 12 pens (16 gilts/pen; 0. 82 m 2 /gilt) containing 8 gilts from each line in a conventional grow-finish unit. Lesion scores were collected the day after placement and every 4 weeks for 3 subsequent periods. The gilt’s body was divided into 4 regions, with each region receiving a score of 0 (0 lesions) to 3 (5 + lesions). All analyses were done using Proc Mixed of SAS. The data were analyzed separately for the day after placement and the subsequent three rounds. Lesion scores for each region of the body were analyzed as repeated measures. Gilts from the LRFI line had lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 045) lesion scores on the day after placement. However, over subsequent rounds there were no (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences between the genetic lines. In conclusion, gilts from the line selected for low RFI had lower lesions scores on the day after placement into the grow-finish environment and this may be a useful tool to use in a selection program for more efficient gilts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} floor type on sow welfare with particular focus on lameness, claw lesions (CL), and injuries. The study used 164 <b>gilts</b> <b>housed</b> in groups of 8 from AI to 110 d of pregnancy in pens with concrete (n = 84) slatted floor left uncovered or covered by 10 -mm rubber slat mats (n = 80) through 2 parities. Lameness (0 = normal to 5 = severe), limb (0 = normal to 6 = severe) and body (0 = normal to 5 = severe) lesions, and manure on the body (MOB; score 0 to 2) were recorded at AI, 24 to 72 h postmixing, between 50 and 70 d of pregnancy, and 2 wk before farrowing. Claw lesions (score 0 = normal to 3 = severe) were recorded at AI and between 50 and 70 d of pregnancy. The dirtiness and wetness of the floors was scored weekly (score 0 = clean to 4 = > 75 % of the pen soiled/wet). Data from {{the first and second}} parities were analyzed separately. Sows were categorized as nonlame (score = 2). Median (M-e) scores were calculated for CL and body and limb lesions and were classified as {{less than or equal to}} the median or greater than the median lesion scores. Sows on rubber slat mats had a reduced risk of lameness during both parities (P < 0. 01) compared with sows on concrete. They also had an increased risk of scores greater than the median for toe overgrowth (Me = 2 and Me = 3 in the first and second parity, respectively) and heel sole crack (HSC; M-e = 3) during both parities (P < 0. 01) and for cracks in the wall (CW; M-e = 4) and white line damage (WL; M-e = 4; P < 0. 01) in the first and second parity, respectively. There was a reduced risk of lameness in sows with scores greater than the median for HSC (P = 0. 05) in the first parity and WL (M-e = 3; P < 0. 01) and CW (Me = 3; P < 0. 05) in the second parity. Wounds (M-e = 3) and severe lesions (M-e = 0) on the limbs with scores greater than the median were associated with an increased risk of lameness (P < 0. 01) in the first and second parity, respectively. Sows on rubber slat mats had a reduced risk of scores greater than the median for swellings (M-e = 4) and wounds (P < 0. 01) during both parities. Pens with rubber slat mats were dirtier than uncovered pens (P < 0. 01); however, there was no association between MOB and flooring type. There was also no association between body lesion score and flooring type. In this study, CL were not associated with an increased risk of lameness. Therefore, even though rubber slat mats were associated with an increased risk of CL, they improved the welfare of group housed sows by reducing the risk of lameness and limb lesions...|$|R
40|$|Both {{restricted}} feeding and barren housing {{have a negative}} influence on sow welfare. The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether sows that have to search for their feed in a substrate on the floor show less stereotyped (and other abnormal) behaviour and have a lower physiological stress response. In three batches, 96 <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> individually in two rooms in 3. 1 m 2 pens with 1. 9 m 2 solid floor. In a 2 × 2 factorial design either wood shavings (S) or no substrate (NS) were provided on the floor, and 900 g of feed was provided twice daily (06 : 30 and 15 : 00 h) either in a trough (T) or on the floor (F). In weeks 8 ¿ 12, behaviour was scan-sampled once in the periods 07 : 00 ¿ 09 : 00 h (P 1), 10 : 00 ¿ 12 : 00 h (P 2), and 13 : 00 ¿ 15 : 00 h (P 3). Data from the 5 weeks were pooled per animal.

40|$|There {{is general}} {{acceptance}} that mixing sows {{during the first}} 3 weeks of gestation is detrimental to embryo development and survival. However, there is a paucity of data describing the influence of group housing and remixing during the first 14 days of gestation on pregnancy outcomes. Using 96 purebred maternal (Large White) /terminal (Duroc) line gilts, the current study determined the effects of regrouping, and the timing of regrouping, during the pre-implantation period on embryo mortality. The {{study was conducted in}} 2 blocks, with 12 gilts allocated to each of 4 treatments in each block. At 175 days of age, the combination of PG 600 and 20 min of daily physical boar contact was used to stimulate puberty, with boar contact resuming 12 days after first detection of oestrus and gilts receiving two artificial inseminations (AIs), 24 h apart, at their second oestrus. After their first AI gilts were allocated to one of four treatment groups (n = 12 gilts/treatment). Gilts in one treatment group were housed individually in stalls (STALL). The remaining gilts continued to be housed in their pre-AI groups and were either not remixed (NOMIX), or remixed to form new groups on day 3 / 4 (RMIXD 3 / 4) or day 8 / 9 (RMIXD 8 / 9) of gestation (day 0 = day of first detection of second oestrus and first insemination). Group-housed <b>gilts</b> were <b>housed</b> in groups of 6, with a space allowance of 2. 4 m²/gilt. All gilts were fed once a day (2. 2 kg/gilt). Reproductive tracts were collected on day 26. 6 ± 0. 13 of gestation, and the number of corpora lutea (CL) and viable embryos counted. Pregnancy rate was similar across all treatments, averaging 94. 5 % across the four treatment groups. The number of embryos present on day 26 of gestation was unaffected by housing treatments (P > 0. 05); gilts in the STALL, NOMIX, RMIXD 3 / 4 and RMIXD 8 / 9 groups possessed 13. 2 ± 0. 67, 12. 9 ± 0. 66, 14. 1 ± 0. 46 and 13. 8 ± 0. 57 embryos, respectively. Similarly, embryo survival rates were 0. 91 ± 0. 04, 0. 85 ± 0. 04, 0. 91 ± 0. 02 and 0. 87 ± 0. 05 for the STALL, NOMIX, RMIXD 3. 4 and RMIXD 8 / 9 groups, respectively (P > 0. 05). In conclusion, the current data indicate that individually <b>housing</b> <b>gilts</b> immediately after their first AI does not improve embryo survival. There also appear to be no adverse effects on embryo development or survival when group-housed, mated gilts are remixed during the first 10 days of gestation. W. H. E. J. van Wettere, S. J. Pain, P.
