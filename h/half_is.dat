5|$|The one {{exception}} to the compactness of the quartet comes in the minuet. The minuet's first <b>half</b> <b>is</b> a standard 12 measures, but the second <b>half</b> <b>is</b> an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E
5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first <b>half</b> <b>is</b> set within the planetarium while the latter <b>half</b> <b>is</b> set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The first is a feature that allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game. The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|Half of {{the sermon}} {{is used to}} criticise the Whigs and their {{political}} activities. The other <b>half</b> <b>is</b> devoted to condemning Tories who betray other Tories as criminals, to gain favour with the Whigs. The Whigs are characterised as the persecutors of the early Christians, and betraying Tories are characterised as apostates.|$|E

5|$|The north <b>half</b> <b>is</b> an unornamented {{vertical}} mass of purple-brown brick, flaring gently out at {{the base}} and top, with vertically continuous bay windows projecting out. The south <b>half</b> <b>is</b> vertically divided by brickwork at the base and rises to a large copper cornice at the roof. Projecting window bays in both halves allow large exposures of glass, giving the building an open appearance despite its mass. The Monadnock {{is part of the}} Printing House Row District, which also includes the Fisher Building, the Manhattan Building, and the Old Colony Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower <b>half</b> <b>is</b> the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper <b>half</b> <b>is</b> the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched and the other <b>half</b> <b>is</b> found there.|$|E

5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. This is also the fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. The other <b>half</b> <b>is</b> listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E
5|$|Chicago's fourth ward {{is on the}} South Side of Chicago, {{adjacent}} to the Lake Michigan lakefront. It includes all of the Kenwood and Oakland community areas, the northern portion of Hyde Park and the eastern portions of the Washington Park, Grand Boulevard and Douglas community areas. The {{northern part of the}} ward (North of 45th Street) is predominantly poor and African American, while the more racially diverse southern <b>half</b> <b>is</b> predominantly middle and upper middle-class.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé of the hardest level of difficulty, five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first <b>half</b> <b>is</b> a series of corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E

5|$|NY33A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33 {{just east of}} the village of Bergen in the town of the same name. From this point, NY33 travels to the west and to the northeast while NY33A heads east. Less {{than a quarter of a}} mile (0.4km) from its western terminus, NY33A meets Interstate490 (I-490) at exit2. In this area, I-490 straddles the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound <b>half</b> <b>is</b> in Monroe County.|$|E
5|$|Over 15,000 {{students}} attend classes on the UND campus each year. About 40 {{percent of the}} student body is from North Dakota and the other <b>half</b> <b>is</b> made up of students from all 50 states and over 60 other nations. The ratio between male and female students is about even. Demographically, about 80 percent {{of the student body}} is caucasian. Students can live on or off campus. On campus, there are 14 residence halls and 850 student apartment units, as well as thirteen fraternities and seven sororities. There are over 275 student organizations at UND as well as an intramural sports program called RecSports.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second <b>half</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between major and minor. The minuet features a startling harmonic shift: its second <b>half</b> <b>is</b> suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio {{is linked to the}} minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E
5|$|US Highway25A (US25) was an {{alternate}} route that {{started at the}} Michigan–Ohio state line south of Erie and ran northward along Summit Street to an intersection with US25 near Erie. The highway was designated in 1937, and it was replaced by US24A in 1945. The southern half of the highway was later designated as part of I-75 in 1959, and the northern <b>half</b> <b>is</b> now an unsigned highway designated Connector 75 by MDOT.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook {{has a low}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 7.2% of all households. This {{is one of the}} lowest figures in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 31.1% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Windy Nook into halves and lists the eastern half in the top 20% of all deprived areas in England in 2011. The western <b>half</b> <b>is</b> not considered deprived.|$|E

5|$|Herm is only 1½miles long (north-south) {{and less}} than half a mile wide (east-west). In the {{northern}} part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grande Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of {{the northern part of the}} island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern <b>half</b> <b>is</b> rocky. Much of Herm's bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right <b>half</b> <b>is</b> described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of the}} stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom <b>half</b> <b>is</b> in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
