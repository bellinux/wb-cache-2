5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} to film the Fireflash controlled landing sequence, Meddings {{was faced with}} the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios. His compact and cost-efficient solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> foreground, the sky background and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop. This [...] "rolling road" [...] (or [...] "roller-road") technique marked a progression from the [...] "rolling sky" [...] that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as Stingray.|$|E

2500|$|A former {{resident}} of the area reports that [...] "in the early 1960s" [...] the two stones were located on a <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> beside the main Cromer road and argues {{that they may be}} [...] glacial erratics which were formerly [...] "used by the local Iceni for the sort of rituals Celts did with stones with depressions elsewhere".|$|E
2500|$|The corner {{led from}} a {{downhill}} straight (Hill top) into a fifth gear, off camber right bend. [...] There {{was a deep}} kerbing section {{on the inside of}} the corner which combined with the off camber nature of the corner caused a car to become very difficult to control. [...] The kerbing and camber tended to make the car veer to the outside of the circuit. [...] The Armco barrier on the outside of the corner eventually intersected with the <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> and caused a lack of run off area.|$|E
2500|$|The calvary {{dates to}} between 1450 and 1460 and {{stands on the}} <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> ("placitre") in front of Saint-Jean-Trolimon's Notre-Dame Chapel. It is the oldest of Finistére's six [...] "grands calvaires" [...] and {{is thought to be}} the work of several {{workshops}} operating in Scaër, mainly that of the [...] "Maître de Tronoën". Several points emerge when this calvary is compared with the others in this region. Firstly there are two scenes devoted to Jesus' baptism. Then in the nativity scene, the statue of the baby Jesus shows him standing and aged about seven rather than as a new-born child. There are three crosses depicted, with those bearing the two robbers being a part of the composition. The calvary also depicts two angels collecting Jesus' blood and a [...] "Mise au tombeau", the scene showing Jesus being prepared for burial, a standard feature of other such calvaries, is not included and neither is the [...] "Flight into Egypt", nor Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his arrest. Conversely the subjects of the Last judgement and Garden of Eden are covered. The Notre-Dame Chapel dates to the 15th century. It replaced an ancient Romano-Gallic temple dedicated to the goddess Venus (mythology) and was thought to have been commissioned by the Pont barons.|$|E

The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry and sunny before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature was , Michael Schumacher maintained his starting line advantage heading into Copse corner followed by Häkkinen. Coulthard, driving on the inside line heading into Copse corner, {{was hit in the}} rear-end by Trulli who took the inside line and both spun with Trulli going into the gravel trap at Copse corner and Coulthard went across the <b>grass</b> <b>verge</b> and onto the pit lane exit road. Further back, Villeneuve was unable to shift into a higher gear because his automatic upshifting system failed and was forced to use to switch to a manual start. He then drove in a gear he did not intend to drive in, and applied his brakes hard locking his front wheels, rendering him unable to steer and made contact with team-mate Panis, who retired from the race after going into the gravel trap at Copse corner next to Trulli's car. Montoya made a quick gateway, moving up from eighth to third {{by the end of the}} first lap and his team-mate Ralf Schumacher made up five positions over the same distance. Frentzen, however, made a poor start and lost three positions before the first lap ended. Further behind, Verstappen made the best start in the field as he moved up from 17th to eleventh and Alesi moved up four positions. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led by 0.3 seconds from Häkkinen and both drivers were followed by Montoya, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Frentzen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Button, Bernoldi, Irvine, Burti, Fisichella, Coulthard and Alonso.|$|E
