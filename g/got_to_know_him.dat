500|$|Kaczynski {{attended}} Evergreen Park Community High School {{where he}} excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band {{and was a}} member of the math, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates. In 1996, a former classmate said: [...] "He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak." [...] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the [...] "briefcase boys" [...] for their penchant for carrying briefcases. One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as [...] "the smartest kid in the class... just quiet and shy until you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> Once he knew you, he could talk and talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Björk was {{intending}} to have several producers {{work on the}} album, but this idea never came to fruition. Björk was then {{going to have the}} album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sinéad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating that [...] "I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then I met him, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> [...] got to hear about his fabulous ideas..." [...] Björk and Hooper's recording ideas were very similar, which led to the decision to end production work with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers. Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] with Hooper and produced [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] solely herself. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he first}} arrived at Radio 1, John Peel took an instant dislike to Moyles and {{accused him of}} being a [...] "DLT-in-waiting". Moyles {{retorted}} that Peel was a [...] "Kenny Everett-in-waiting, because Kenny Everett's dead and it's {{only a matter of time}} before John pops his clogs". However, in his biography Moyles goes on to say that he mended his relationship with Peel and felt a sense of loss that he had not <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> before his death.|$|E
2500|$|While polls {{attributed}} Davis' declining popularity to {{the energy}} and budget problems, some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal. Davis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat John L. Burton, {{the leader of the}} California State Senate, was Davis' chief antagonist. In 2003, Republican leader Jim Brulte told The Los Angeles Times that Davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times. [...] "I never felt I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> ... I always felt a little sorry for him".|$|E
2500|$|The writer W. S. Crockett {{considered}} Jonathan Oldbuck to be {{more firmly}} based on real-life models than any other of Scott's characters, Edie Ochiltree alone excepted. [...] Scott himself {{tells us that the}} character was loosely based on a friend of his father’s, one George Constable, a retired lawyer who lived at a country house called Wallace-Craigie, near Dundee. [...] Scott first <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> when only six years old, {{and for the first time}} learned from Constable about Falstaff, Hotspur and other characters from Shakespeare. [...] Scott’s biographer Hesketh Pearson attributes to this the fact that The Antiquary contains more quotations from and allusions to Shakespeare than any other of his novels. [...] The resemblance between the real and fictional characters was detected by a friend of Constable and of Scott’s father, George Chalmers, much to Scott's astonishment, since he believed he had erased all such similarities as might be recognized. [...] He claimed that ...|$|E
5000|$|Turner's father, also a guitarist (who {{played in}} Richard Clapton's band {{as well as}} various outfits around Adelaide), left before Turner was born and {{returned}} only briefly when Turner was two years old. He later died of a heroin overdose in 1999. Turner has expressed regret at not having known his father and considers his music career to be a tribute to his father's memory. [...] "I just felt sad that I never really <b>got</b> the chance <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> And because he didn't die in the nicest way. He died in a tragic way." [...] "I've done {{all of this to}} honour his memory, because he didn't get the chance {{to make it in the}} music industry." ...|$|R
6000|$|But our Colonel, we {{all were}} obliged to acknowledge, was no more our friend of old days. He knew us again, and was good to every one round him, as his wont was; {{especially}} when Boy came, his old eyes lighted up with simple happiness, and, with eager trembling hands, he would seek under his bedclothes, or {{the pockets of his}} dressing-gown, for toys or cakes, which he had caused to be purchased for his grandson. There was a little laughing, red-cheeked, white-headed gown-boy of the school, to whom the old man had taken a great fancy. One of the symptoms of his returning consciousness and recovery, as we hoped, was his calling for this child, who pleased our friend by his archness and merry ways; and who, to the old gentleman's unfailing delight, used to call him, [...] "Codd Colonel." [...] "Tell little F----, that Codd Colonel wants to see him;" [...] and the little gown-boy was brought to him; and the Colonel would listen to him for hours; and hear all about his lessons and his play; and prattle almost as childishly about Dr. Raine, and his own early school-days. The boys of the school, it must be said, had heard the noble old gentleman's touching history, and had all <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and love <b>him.</b> They came every day to hear news of him; sent him in books and papers to amuse him; and some benevolent young souls,--God's blessing on all honest boys, say I,--painted theatrical characters, and sent them in to Codd Colonel's grandson. The little fellow was made free of gown-boys, and once came thence to his grandfather in a little gown, which delighted the old man hugely. Boy {{said he would like to}} be a little gown-boy; and I make no doubt, when he is old enough, his father will get him that post, and put him under the tuition of my friend Dr. Senior.|$|R

2500|$|Bouvier {{moved back}} to Merrywood and {{was hired as a}} {{part-time}} receptionist at the Washington Times-Herald. A week later, she approached editor Frank Waldrop and requested more challenging work; she was given the position of [...] "Inquiring Camera Girl", despite Waldrop's initial concerns about her competence. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures to be published in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random [...] "man on the street" [...] vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election. During this time, Bouvier was also briefly engaged to a young stockbroker, John G. W. Husted, Jr. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in The New York Times in January 1952. She broke off the engagement after three months, as she began to find him [...] "immature and boring" [...] once she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> better.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and {{the rest}} of Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi {{convinced}} he would be executed when he arrived. At the border, there were two lines of soldiers, one Soviet and the other Chinese, and as Puyi walked past, he remembered how the faces of the other prisoners were [...] "deathly pale". Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this {{was the beginning of a}} new life for him. In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life used ni (你), the informal word for you instead of nin (您), the formal word for you to address people. When the train stopped at Changchun to pick up food, Puyi was convinced that was he was going to be shot at his former capital, and he was much relieved when the train resumed its journey to Fushun. Except for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning province until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers. Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the other prisoners, who liked to humiliate an emperor, and he might not have survived his imprisonment except for the fact that the warden Jin Yuan went out of his way to protect him. Jin had grown up under Manchukuo and as a schoolboy in the 1930s had kowtowed to portraits of Puyi and waved the Manchukuo flag in the streets when Puyi made visits to Harbin. As Jin had grown up in Manchukuo, he was fluent in Japanese, which was why he was selected to be the warden of Fushun. Jin was assigned the job in 1950 and told Behr in a 1986 interview that: [...] "I didn't welcome the idea at all. I tried to get another posting. I wanted nothing to do with those who had been responsible for my older brother's death and my family's suffering during the Manchukuo years. I wondered how I could ever bear to be in their company". However, Jin further told Behr that he [...] "came to like Puyi quite a bit" [...] as he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> and protected him from the other prisoners. In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.|$|E

His Majesty King George the Third was present, with all the princesses and royal dukes, while upwards of three hundred of the general nobility and other persons of distinction were also in the town at the time.

Even there in the lost heart of Africa, at such a distance from home, with so little chance of ever making any use of his hoarded wealth, the fellow used to hunt up those wretched small stones, and wear them night and day in a belt round his waist, as if he really loved them for their own mere sakes--dirty high-priced little baubles!
