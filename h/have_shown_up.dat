500|$|Mark Shiel {{explains}} the rising popularity of cult films {{as an attempt}} by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, {{as well as a}} lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. [...] According to Xavier Mendik, [...] "academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now." [...] Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that [...] "it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential." [...] Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless. [...] Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion. [...] Cult films <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>up</b> in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and L'Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture. [...] When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films [...] "cultural vandalism". [...] Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted.|$|E
