40|$|Pedicle screws are {{commonly}} utilized in spinal surgery; however, traditional designs {{often do not}} provide adequate fixation in osteoporotic spines. The objective of this thesis {{was to develop a}} novel <b>expanding</b> <b>screw</b> for use in osteoporotic lumbar pedicles. Helical screws capable of expanding post insertion were built on a rapid prototype machine. A materials testing machine performed axial load to failure tests in both Sawbones and cadaveric specimens comparing the new design to traditional screws (rate = 10 mm/min to 20 mm). Output parameters included yield load, ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and total energy. The <b>expanding</b> <b>screw</b> showed a 36 % increase in total energy (p= 0. 02), but no other differences were identified. Based on this initial design, the expandable pedicle screws failed to demonstrate improved screw pullout; however, differences may be observed in other loading modes (i. e., toggle) and further design modifications and improvements in post-build machining may provide beneficial enhancements...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{evaluated}} {{changes in}} the smile characteristics of patients with maxillary constriction submitted to rapid maxillary expansion (RME). METHODS: The sample consisted of 81 extraoral photographs of maximum smile of 27 patients with mean age of 10 years, before expansion and 3 and 6 months after fixation of the <b>expanding</b> <b>screw.</b> The photographs were analyzed on the software Cef X 2001, with achievement of the following measurements: Transverse smile area, buccal corridors, exposure of maxillary incisors, gingival exposure of maxillary incisors, smile height, upper and lower lip thickness, smile symmetry and smile arch. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: RME promoted statistically {{significant increase in the}} transverse smile dimension and exposure of maxillary central and lateral incisors; maintenance of right and left side smile symmetry and of the lack of parallelism between the curvature of the maxillary incisal edges and lower lip border. CONCLUSIONS: RME was beneficial for the smile esthetics with the increase of the transverse smile dimension and exposure of maxillary central and lateral incisors...|$|E

Método: A amostra compreendeu 18 indivíduos leucodermas (11 meninas e 7 meninos; idade média: 8 anos e 10 meses no início do tratamento) que apresentavam atresia da maxila, acompanhadas ou não de mordida cruzada posterior uni ou bilateral na fase de denti ção mista. Todos os pacientes foram tratados com aparelho ortodônti co removível superior com torno de expansão simétrico e mediano, sendo o tempo médio de tratamento de 15, 4 meses (± 7, 6). Para avaliar a infl uência do tratamento nas mensurações dos pontos demarcados nas regiões oclusal, gengival e alveolar, foram uti lizados os modelos de gesso dos arcos superior e inferior (36 pares) obti dos em dois tempos: T 1 : início do tratamento e T 2 : ao fi nal do tratamento. Para cada paciente em ambos os tempos, foram mensuradas as distâncias transversas na região oclusal entre caninos decíduos, 1 o molares decíduos ou 1 o pré-molares permanentes e entre 1 o molares permanentes, superiores e inferiores. Para verifi car se a movimentação ocorreu por inclinação ou por movimento de corpo, foram uti lizadas também medidas nas regiões gengival e alveolar. Os dados foram avaliados estati sti camente pelo teste “t student para amostras pareadas (5 %). Resultados: Observou-se que em T 2, todas as distâncias mensuradas para as regiões oclusal, gengival e alveolar apresentaram valores estati sti camente superiores às mesmas medidas em T 1 (p< 0, 05). Conclusão: O aparelho ortodônti co removível superior é efeti vo nos casos de expansão lenta da maxila, agindo também indiretamente nas dimensões transversas do arco inferior. Objecti ve: To {{evaluate the}} eff ects of slow maxillary and mandibular expansion using upper removable orthodonti c appliance with symmetric and median <b>expanding</b> <b>screw</b> in the occlusal, gingival and alveolar regions of young pati ents with narrow maxilla. Method: The {{sample consisted of}} 18 Caucasian children (11 females and 7 males; mean age {{at the beginning of}} treatment: 8 years and 10 months) with narrow maxilla associated or not with unilateral or bilateral posterior crossbite in the mixed dentiti on phase. All pati ents were treated during a mean period of 15. 4 (± 7. 6) months with upper removable orthodonti c appliances with symmetric and median <b>expanding</b> <b>screw.</b> Maxillary and mandibular cast models (36 pairs) obtained at two moments (T 1 : beginning of the treatment and T 2 : end of the treatment) were used to evaluate the infl uence of the treatment in the measurements of the points demarcated in the occlusal, gingival and alveolar regions. For each pati ent, the transverse distances in the occlusal region between primary canines, primary fi rst molars and fi rst premolars, and between the permanent maxillary and mandibular molars were measured in ambos ti mes. In order to determine whether the movement occurred due to inclinati on and translati on, measurements in the gingival and alveolar regions were also taken. The obtained data were analyzed statistically by the Student’s t-test for paired samples at a signifi cance level of 5 %. Results: All distances measured for the occlusal, gingival and alveolar regions in T 2 presented signifi cantly higher values (p< 0. 05) than those obtained in T 1. Conclusion: The upper removable orthodonti c appliance is eff ecti ve in cases of slow maxillary expansion, also acti ng indirectly in the transverse dimensions of the mandibular arch...|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{creation}} of Thai rice snack with health benefits for higher potential in commercial scale, mulberry leaf was {{applied in the}} production of extruded snack product. Mulberry leaf in dried powder was mixed with rice, corn, soy, sugar, oil, vitamins and minerals to investigate the operating conditions with twin-screw extruder at varying mulberry content (5, 7. 5 and 10 %), screw speed (300 and 350 rpm) and feed moisture (13, 15 and 17 %) in the 3 × 2 × 3 factorial experiment. The extrudates were examined of functional properties (antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds) and some physical characteristics (expansion ratio, bulk density, texture measurement and organoleptic test). The results had shown that at higher mulberry content (10 %), the product was difficult to operate, unsmooth shape and less <b>expand.</b> While lower <b>screw</b> speed (300 rpm) and moderate moisture content (15 %) had trends for suitable expansion and bulk density with better preference in appearance including still have antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds which corresponded to the optimum operating condition (5 % mulberry content, 300 rpm and 15 % feed moisture) from the statistical analysis. Finally, the finished product was evaluated in the pattern of nutrition labeling, microbiological test and packed in metallize bag to examine for moisture content, aw, colour, TBA number, antioxidant activity and sensory test during storage time (0 - 4 months) at room temperature...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the cause}} to {{loosening}} pedicle screws {{has not been}} sufficiently clarified (Mehmanparast et al. 2014). As for the loosening of the screw, Inceoğlu et al. (2008) and Costa et al. (2013) reported that various factors, such as the diameter and material of the screw, or the material and angle of the bone, are involved. Law et al. (1993) and Okuyama et al. (2000) reported that cyclic caudocephalad toggling caused by the craniocaudal screw may {{be the cause of}} loosening. We have investigated the biomechanical study and produced the results of weakness of PS fixation under rotational stress, and it may be the cause of loosening of the screw. In our results, there were significant differences (p <  0.05) in the rotational angles between the screw and the vertebral body for both the L 3 and L 4 vertebral bodies. As far as {{we have been able to}} determine, no biomechanical study has been conducted from the viewpoint of rotational micromovement between the screw and the vertebral body, and this paper may be the first study to confirm that there is rotational micromovement between the vertebral body and the screw. This showed the possibility that occurrence of this rotational micromovement caused repeated friction between the bones and the screw within the living body, which led to loosening of the screw or pullout of PS fixation. For this problem, we suggest some ideas. First, expandable screw are useful, because the <b>screws</b> <b>expand</b> in vertebral body and have large contact area to bone. It is under experiment in our laboratory. Additional fixation like sublaminar wirings and trial of raising bone density are also useful.|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{analytical}} review of scientific publications the goal and general guidelines were grounded. The prospects of using structurally modified and structurally inhomogeneous materials based on titanium and aluminum alloys were shown. The analysis of power loading schemes of isothermal extrusion was made. Typical schemes of loading {{as a result}} of structural and logical analysis were classified depending on the impact of shear stresses, which are proportional to the forces of friction, on the overall stress state in the cell strains. The general method of work, which includes the method of theoretical numerical and experimental analysis was considered. The theory of plastic flow is proposed for theoretical analysis. A new approach for calculation of shear strains in the overall process of deformation was created based on the general equations of the theory of plastic flow continuum. Based on the proposed approach, it was considered the process of extrusion with active friction forces that create large shear deformation in the cross section of the channel through which the solid medium moves. The research of isothermal forging process for <b>screw</b> <b>expanding</b> extrusion was carried out. Based on theoretical models the kinematic relationships of the deformation process was studied and contribution of shear deformation on the formation of the microstructure of the metal after deformation was determined. In a production environment shows promising The prospects of further treatment of modified metals by screw forging for following stamping processes, such as hot extrusion, was demonstrated in production environment The process of intense plastic deformation in the center of deformation during of drawing of bimetallic materials with thinning with heating was investigated. Theoretic models were obtained for calculation of combined drawing with thinning of two-layer cylindrical workpiece for perfectly-plastic material as well as a theoretical model of drawing of two-layer workpiece with regard to the forces of friction on the contact surfaces of the workpiece with the matrix and punch, between layers of dissimilar metals. The research results of intensive plastic deformation of surface burnishing with additional ultrasonic load were presented. The experimental data as for experimental-industrial experience of isothermal extrusion of billets of blades were presented.
