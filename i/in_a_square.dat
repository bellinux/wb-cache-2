5|$|In Eastern inland Norway and Trøndelag, {{the houses}} around a tun were {{typically}} organized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> (firkanttun); in Gudbrandsdal, {{there was a}} distinction between inntun (inner tun) and uttun (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.|$|E
5|$|Originally named Chicago Municipal Airport, it {{was renamed}} {{to honor the}} Battle of Midway in 1942. The {{airfield}} is located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> mile bounded by 55th and 63rd Streets and Central Cicero Avenues. The current terminal complex was completed in 2001. The terminal bridges Cicero Avenue and contains 43 gates with facilities for international passengers. Stevenson Expressway (I-55) and the CTA Orange Line provide freeway and rapid transit access to the Loop.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the kitchen garden {{were built in the}} 1920s and include two {{gateways}} with neoclassical architraves. The gravel paths are laid out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> with a cross at the centre enhanced by a fountain surrounded by fruit trees, vegetable plots and soft fruits. There are carriage openings with wrought-iron gates.|$|E

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> around a courtyard. At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|The Romanian premiere {{took place}} on June 4, 2006 at the Transylvania International Film Festival, in Cluj-Napoca. In Bucharest, a first display of the movie was {{organized}} on September 8, 2006, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> established for this purpose on Calea Rahovei Street. The public, {{as well as the}} critics from the country, received the movie very well, but the difficulty caused by the movie's unusual duration only allowed for the movie to be on display on a few other occasions. The same problem was encountered when the movie was sent to film festivals outside Romania, being either rejected due to the impossibly of being included in any of the standard categories or included as a short fiction (for example, at Brooklyn).|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|At this time, Li Yuan's {{infantry}} began arriving, {{with the}} van division deploying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> {{to fend off}} a Sui attack while the other two divisions were coming up behind it. Wen Daya's account now becomes sketchier, indicating that the infantry charged the Sui army, at which point Li Yuan's sons led the cavalry around the Sui flank towards the town, where the small garrison left behind by Song Laosheng was forced to drop the portcullis gates. Li Yuan then let spread the rumour that Song Laosheng had been killed, which demoralized the Sui force. The Sui army began to retreat, but this turned into a rout when they found their retreat to Huoyi cut off by Li Yuan's cavalry and the barred gates. Wen Daya's narrative can be supplemented by the later account, which, despite its bias regarding Li Shimin, also contains indications that not everything went according to Li Yuan's plans: it appears {{that in the first}} clash between Li Yuan's infantry and the Sui army, the Sui had the upper hand and pushed Li Yuan back, possibly because he had not yet managed to bring all his forces into the field. Either through the arrival of the rest of Li Yuan's infantry, the actions of Li Yuan's cavalry along and behind the Sui flanks, or Li Yuan's stratagem, the Sui army's morale gave way abruptly, and their resistance collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Constructed to Cubitt's own designs, the new mansion had a {{very similar}} style to that of Osborne House. Cubitt's {{attention}} to detail was such that he even manufactured his own bricks at a brickworks he {{set up for the}} purpose, using lime extracted from the chalk quarries on {{the eastern edge of the}} estate. Almost one hundred rooms made up the Italianate structure's three storeys, stretching across nine bays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> formation. Cubitt contrived his own form of soundproofing by concealing seashells between levels. The flat roof was edged with a parapet embellished with balustrades, and a matching decoration was incorporated round the first floor, both made from Portland stone. Gibbs surrounds were used on the windows on the ground floor whereas triangular pediments featured on the windows included on the three central canted bays of the first floor. Segmented pediments adorned all the remaining windows. The water supply was provided by the well installed by Tyers, which was close to the southeast corner of the new mansion, via a corridor that spanned the entire outside of the mansion. The entrance had an attached porte-cochère enabling visitors to gain undercover access to the outer hall directly from their transport.|$|E

5|$|More {{and more}} state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the {{procession}} each year, and the event {{began to take}} on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, {{in the presence of the}} royal family, by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with a fireplace. At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially Vojvodina and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry with very large boulder quoins; {{the roof is}} made from slate with stone copings. The {{main part of the}} church is 45feet 6inches long by 15feet 3inches wide (13.87 by 4.65m); the annexe at the west end {{measures}} 20feet 6inches by 15feet 6inches (6.25 by 4.72m). At the west end of the roof of the nave, there is a bellcote with a single bell decorated with three bull heads, dated 1661; at the east end, there is a cross. There is no structural division between the nave and the chancel. The annexe at the west end is smaller and lower in height than the main building, and was built in line with it. It may have been built for use as a schoolroom. It has a 16th-century doorway at the west end, converted into a window in the 19th century, and a modern door at the east end, as well as an 18th-century fireplace. The main entrance into the church is {{on the north side of}} the nave, dating from the late 15th century. The doorway is pointed, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> frame.|$|E
