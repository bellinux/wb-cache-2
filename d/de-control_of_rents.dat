We study the social cost <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking when rents endure over time, but may have to be re-contested because <b>of</b> imperfect <b>rent</b> protection, or may disappear because of deregulation. The present value <b>of</b> a contested <b>rent</b> measures the social cost <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking, irrespective <b>of</b> imperfect <b>rent</b> protection and the prospect <b>of</b> deregulation. <b>Rent</b> seeking is discouraged by the inability of governments to commit to protect rents and by their inability to commit to rent-generating regulations and policies.

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{problems}} {{arising from the}} use of the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> in mortgage loan transactions, which have continued for over a century, as well as possible solutions. Rents are {{a significant part of the}} security for loans secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, shopping centers, and apartments. Under present law in many states, the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> is the only means by which lenders can create an effective security interest in <b>rents</b> <b>of</b> mortgaged property. An absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> purports to transfer title to rents to the mortgage lender although in substance it creates a security interest in rents. The Article explores the historical development of the absolute assignment <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> and discusses the confusion, unnecessary litigation, and even injustice that it causes under state law and in bankruptcy. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has recently approved the new Uniform Assignment <b>of</b> <b>Rents</b> Act, which removes the necessity for absolute assignments <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> by creating a workable and comprehensive scheme for the creation of security interests in rents.

40|$|Urban {{land rent}} theory has both fascinated and {{repelled}} researchers. The fascination {{stems from the}} idea that rent holds the key to urban spatial structures and distributional conflicts. The repulsion is based on bemusement at the complexity and jargon <b>of</b> the <b>rent</b> literature and rejection <b>of</b> <b>rent's</b> assumed centrality. In this paper the author surveys the urban rent literature and presents an alternative interpretation of the role <b>of</b> urban <b>rent.</b> It is suggested that the ambiguous theoretical status <b>of</b> urban land <b>rent</b> stems from an overemphasis in the rent literature on the distributional implications <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> mechanisms {{at the expense of}} their potential influence on the social relations of building provision. The neoclassical economics model <b>of</b> urban <b>rent</b> and land use is critically evaluated and the extensive attempts to apply Marx's theory <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> to the urban situation are questioned. The ability to revive Marxist urban rent theory through the treatment <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> as a component of structures of building provision is then elaborated by reference to housing provision and office development. When placed in such a historical context, it is suggested, rent takes on a more meaningful, if less messianic, role. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} rent seeking and economic performance when governments cannot enforce property rights. With imperfect credit markets and a fixed cost <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking, only wealthy agents choose to engage in it, since it enables them to protect their wealth from expropriation. Hence, the level <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking and economic performance {{are determined by the}} initial distribution of income and wealth. When individuals also differ in their productivity, not all wealthy agents become rent seekers and the social costs <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking are typically lower.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Nash equilibrium model of rent-seeking behavior in which risk-averse players expend resources {{to obtain a}} share <b>of</b> a <b>rent,</b> as for example in contests for import quota licences. Results are obtained relating the equilibrium level of lobbying effort by each player to the value <b>of</b> the <b>rent.</b> In particular, reduced individual lobbying effort is associated with higher rents contested if players are sufficiently risk averse. The {{question of whether the}} value <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> is a good measure of the resource cost <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> seeking is also considered. A simple approximation involving risk and risk-aversion parameters is derived for the proportion <b>of</b> <b>rents</b> dissipated in long-run equilibrium. Risk and risk aversion are seen to reduce the rent-dissipation ratio below unity. Copyright 1987 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

40|$|Private rental {{markets in}} Finland {{were subject to}} rent control from 1967 until the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s when the rent control system was gradually abolished. This study estimates the costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control to tenants in private rental dwellings in 1990 using the years 1998 and 2001 as benchmarks. Special emphasis is placed on the welfare costs of increased discrepancies between actual and desired housing consumption due to the overdemand situation caused by rent control. Earlier studies on the welfare effects <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control usually assume that the household would consume on the estimated demand curve in the absence <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control. Here it is shown that this assumption biases estimates of the net benefit <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control to tenants downwards and welfare measures are derived that also allow for suboptimal housing consumption in the absence <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control. The empirical implementation of these measures utilizes micro-simulation to differentiate between ?natural? free market disequilibrium costs and additional disequilibrium costs caused by rent control. According to the results, the additional disequilibrium costs offset roughly 30 per cent of the benefits <b>of</b> lower <b>rents</b> to tenants and amounted to over 2 per cent of consumption expenditure of tenant households. The estimated net benefit <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> control to tenants, taking both low rents and disequilibrium costs into account, was 4. 5 or 6. 5 per cent of consumption expenditure, depending on the reference year. The ratio of the net benefit to tenants to the costs <b>of</b> lower <b>rents</b> to landlords was 64 or 72 per cent. Rent control, consumer?s surplus, disequilibrium costs...|$|R
