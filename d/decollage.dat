5000|$|<b>Décollage</b> is {{an artistic}} {{technique}} of collage {{to the opposite}} procedure. Instead of adding elements of the work, it starts from an artistic object from which the parts are detached. The idea of <b>decollage</b> was born {{during a period of}} [...] "artistic crisis" [...] and took place following the trip to the US, during which he was in contact with members of the New Dada. Back in Rome he became inspired by torn posters around the town and began to carry them in his studio and to work on them. The result was the creation of canvases on which pasted wheel one or more pieces of torn posters, often superimposed. Rotella wanted to somehow find some form of artistic innovation {{and at the same time}} give artistic dignity to a common object, and of little value removed from its natural environment.The first trials of Rotella with <b>decollage</b> date back to 1953. The first <b>decollage,</b> in most small cases, were exhibited for the first time in the spring of 1955.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{roads that}} Rotella takes on simultaneously, {{starting}} in 1953-1954 {{are those of}} <b>decollage</b> and retro posters. The first retro d'affiche documented date back to 1954. The retro d'affiche are displayed {{for the first time}} to the public in December 1955 at the personal exhibition the artist held at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan. Unlike <b>decollage</b> where often textural layers are wrapped together and manipulated, in the back of posters the artist retains the [...] "urban relic". In these works his speech tends to be subtle, the colors are often absent, the surface is gritty and raw, it has compared to <b>decollage</b> a more targeted research to informal language, except that it will become evident starting especially from the sixties when decollages in expected to bet influenced by the rising pop language.|$|E

5000|$|In art, <b>décollage</b> {{is created}} by cutting, ripping off or {{removing}} pieces of an original image or images to reveal the substrate or the images that lie beneath. A distinct genre of <b>décollage</b> is the torn poster. This happens when a poster has been pasted {{on top of another}} poster and then cut or torn to reveal the poster or posters beneath, or where ripped poster fragments are pasted, layer upon layer, to a canvas or substrate to create a new [...]|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that the depliage is a form of <b>décollage,</b> as it is made by {{initially}} removing the staples from a staple-bound magazine.|$|E
50|$|Lacerated posters {{are also}} {{closely related to}} Richard Genovese's {{practice}} of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar <b>décollage</b> techniques are Mark Bradford, Michael Viviani and Brian Dettmer, who employs a novel method of <b>decollage</b> by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses digitally enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine Paper Mulberry, torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{practitioner of}} <b>décollage</b> was Wolf Vostell. Wolf Vostell noticed the word [...] "décollage" [...] in Le Figaro on 6 September 1954, {{where it was}} used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell’s working concept of <b>décollage,</b> was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media. He also called his Happenings Dé-coll/age-Happening.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst organic <b>decollage</b> appears random, {{the mere}} effect of nature, it also reveals the ego, ideals and {{aspirations}} {{of the people who}} interfere with nature's interference; creating layers, nuance and sometimes meaning. Maria Stengard-Green ...|$|E
5000|$|Jacques Villeglé, born Jacques Mahé de la Villeglé (born 27 March 1926, Quimper, Brittany) is a French {{mixed-media}} {{artist and}} affichiste {{famous for his}} alphabet with symbolic letters and <b>decollage</b> with ripped or lacerated posters.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Décollage,</b> in art, is the {{opposite}} of collage; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image. The French word [...] "décollage" [...] translates into English literally as [...] "take-off" [...] or [...] "to become unglued" [...] or [...] "to become unstuck". Examples of <b>Décollage</b> include etrécissements and cut-up technique. A similar technique is the lacerated poster, a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing {{to a greater or lesser}} degree the poster or posters underneath.|$|E

50|$|Dufrene {{became friends}} with Yves Klein in 1950 and with Raymond Hains and Jacques Villeglé in 1954. In 1957 he {{discovered}} <b>décollage</b> and in 1960 - with Pierre Restany, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, Arman, Hains and Villeglé - and helped found the art group known as Nouveau réalisme.

5000|$|Domenico [...] "Mimmo" [...] Rotella, (Catanzaro, 7 October 1918 [...] - [...] Milan, 8 January 2006), was an Italian artist {{considered}} an important figure in post-war European art. Best {{known for his}} works of <b>décollage</b> and psychogeographics, made from torn advertising posters. He was associated to the Ultra-Lettrists an offshoot of Lettrism and later {{was a member of}} the Nouveau Réalisme, founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany.|$|E
50|$|The {{most celebrated}} {{artists of the}} <b>décollage</b> {{technique}} in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his <b>decollage</b> destroys the advertisement, but leaves its remnants on view {{for the public to}} contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called Nouveau Réalisme (New realism), Paris' answer to the American Pop Art movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included Yves Klein and Christo and was created with the help of critic Pierre Restany), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.|$|E
5000|$|Déchirage (from the French, déchirer: ‘to tear’) is {{an artistic}} style that distresses paper {{to create a}} {{three-dimensional}} patchwork. It {{is a form of}} <b>décollage,</b> taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. Romare Bearden (b. 1911 - d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his abstract expressionist paintings. The first public display of [...] "Photographic" [...] Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the Art of Giving http://www.saatchionline.com/art/view/artist/162075/art/91318#comment-76575-91318 exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Thus the nouveaux réalistes {{advocated}} {{a return to}} [...] "reality" [...] {{in opposition to the}} lyricism of abstract painting. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either petty-bourgeois or as Stalinist socialist realism. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the <b>décollage</b> technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.|$|E
50|$|Visual focus depth art (VFDA) {{is a form}} {{of mixed}} media collage that places an {{emphasis}} on the use of three-dimensional application to individual creations of single one-of-a-kind art pieces to emphasize individual meaning in the work. It is a derivative of assemblage, collage and <b>decollage.</b> The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as projections, the artist tries {{in a variety of ways}} to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.|$|E
5000|$|Bradford's collage Orbit (2007), {{contains}} a magazine {{image of a}} basketball placed {{at the heart of}} a dense lattice of LA streets. Created by the cumulative and subtractive processes of collage and <b>décollage,</b> layered with paint, Orbit appears as an aerial view of a contorting, mutating, and decaying city whose tiny, intricate street grids can no longer maintain its structural integrity. Bradford’s improvisational command of these large areas suggests the formidable energy of mass consumption and, perhaps more importantly, its counterpart, the mass generation of detritus. The image recalls Basquiat's iconographies of black sports heroes, but Bradford's treatment is far more ambivalent; after all, is the dream connoted by the basketball a beacon of hope or a false promise of the easiest exit from the inner city? ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, {{he suffers}} from an artistic crisis, during which {{interrupts}} his pictorial production. Now {{convinced that there}} is nothing to be done again in art, suddenly what he calls [...] "Zen illumination": the discovery of the advertising poster as artistic expression of the city. Thus the <b>décollage</b> (early collages) was born: paste on canvas pieces of torn posters of the street, by adopting the collages of the cubists and contaminating it with Dadaist array of ready made. In 1955, in Rome, in the exhibition [...] "actual art exhibition", he exhibited {{for the first time the}} 'torn poster'. Later, he practiced the so-called double décollage: the poster firstly removed from the billboard, then torn up in his studio. In those years he also made use of the retro d'affiche, using the posters pasted on the side and obtaining non-figurative and monochrome works.|$|E
