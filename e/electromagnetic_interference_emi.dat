The study used 30 participants with implanted devices, and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions {{inside and outside the}} Prius, and each position was evaluated at different speeds.|$|E
25|$|The higher speed {{rates are}} {{achieved}} {{by using a}} two-lane low voltage (0.4V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156MB/s. In full duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (<b>EMI).</b>|$|E

2500|$|A radio {{telescope}} is a specialized antenna and radio receiver used to receive radio waves from astronomical radio {{sources in the}} sky in radio astronomy. Radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy, which studies the radio frequency portion {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} emitted by astronomical objects, just as optical telescopes are the main observing instrument used in traditional optical astronomy which studies the light wave portion of the spectrum coming from astronomical objects. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic ("dish") antennas [...] similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes. [...] They may be used singly, or linked together electronically in an array. [...] Unlike optical telescopes, {{radio telescope}}s can be used in the daytime as well as at night. [...] Since astronomical radio sources such as planets, stars, nebulas and galaxies are very far away, the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak, so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough radio energy to study them, and extremely sensitive receiving equipment. [...] Radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (<b>EMI)</b> from radio, television, radar, motor vehicles, and other manmade electronic devices.|$|E
