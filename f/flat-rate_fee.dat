The measure to submit proposals for this switch was approved by the Florida Board of Governors in November and would result in an 8 percent increase to state tuition, and an average 7 percent increase imposed by UF, which brings the total increase to 15 percent. The switch was estimated at bringing in $4 million of extra recurring revenue annually for the University. UF is the only university in the state that has expressed a desire to pursue block tuition.|$|E

50|$|It was {{reported}} that banks were turning away from Laser because of some difficulties encountered by consumers in making online purchases. However, customers began to complain almost immediately about numerous difficulties caused by the premature withdrawal of Laser cards. Some retailers {{who were able to}} give cashback on Laser cards were unwilling or unable to do so on the replacement cards; Permanent TSB issued a second replacement Visa Debit Card to its customers in April 2011 due to the initial replacement chip and some older terminals not being compatible (i.e. refusing cashback). Other retailers who had been charged a small <b>flat-rate</b> per-transaction <b>fee</b> for Laser transactions found that they were charged a percentage {{of the value of the}} transaction for the replacement cards. Organisations such as Betfair which did not charge customers for Laser card deposits began to charge these customers 1.5% commission on deposits using the replacement Visa debit cards. Merchant Services companies did not advertise whether there were any differences in their charges for the two types of debit card. Some customers reported being charged foreign usage fees on Visa debit cards in Northern Ireland, which had not been charged on the old cards.|$|R
5000|$|Glover is {{the leading}} proponent of an effort by the University of Florida to {{institute}} block tuition, in replacement of having students pay by credit hour. Under one proposal, students would be charged a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>fee</b> analogous to 15 credits for full-time undergraduate students regardless if they take 12, 15 or 18 credits. Charging market-rate tuition for distance-education graduate students is {{also a part of}} the plan. Glover believes block tuition is the [...] "way it should be," [...] believing it would financially benefit students taking a heavy load of classes, cost slightly more for those taking fewer classes, could help increase UF’s graduation rate, and open up spots for students who might otherwise be turned away under enrollment limits. Glover made a statement saying [...] "a student who spends more time here is taking up a spot that a student waiting in the wings is waiting to have." [...] Glover estimates that the switch will generate a “small” revenue boost of about $4 million of extra recurring revenue, which would be reinvested in the form of adding sections to classes and hiring faculty to accommodate more students.|$|E
40|$|Both Britain and Australia {{have seen}} rapid, inadequately funded, {{expansion}} of student numbers, and increasing central planning. To address these problems, this paper argues (a) {{that students should}} pay via a system of income-contingent loans for the private benefits they derive from higher education, and (b) that, within a government-ordained regulatory framework, universities {{should be free to}} set fees and student numbers. In the wake of the Dearing Report in 1997, Britain is making progress on (a) by introducing income-contingent loans to cover student’s living costs. If anything, however, it is moving backwards on (b) by introducing a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>fee</b> of 25 per cent of average tuition costs, abated for poorer students. Though laudable in its equity objectives, the government’s post- Dearing policy has serious problems: it brings in no extra money in the short run; is harmful to access; is inequitable in other ways; and faces serious administrative problems. In contrast, Australia got the design of loans right ten years ago, and the West Committee’s Final Report argues for greater freedom for universities to conduct their own affairs. Once more, Australia looks set fair to give a lead. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Presentation date: 2007 - 09 - 17 Oregon’s {{gasoline}} tax no longer {{serves as an}} economically efficient revenue source due to increasing fuel efficiency {{and the emergence of}} alternative fuels. In response to this problem, the Oregon Department of Transportation is exploring alternatives to the {{gasoline tax}}. Among the most promising alternatives is a flat-rate vehicle mile tax. Critics argue that a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>fee</b> will discourage the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles and may impact social groups differently, placing a heavier burden on lower income and rural households. This paper estimates the socio-economic impacts of the proposed policy based on income and location using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Three-Stage-Least Squares (3 SLS) model and Oregon data from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. Suits Indices indicate both the gasoline and VMT taxes are, overall, regressive. The OLS model suggests the VMT fee will be more regressive than the gasoline tax, while the 3 SLS model suggests the VMT fee will be slightly more progressive than the gasoline tax. The overall impact of a policy shift depends largely the model specification chosen. Furthermore, the 3 SLS results appear to be consistent with public concerns. The average household will reduce its average fuel efficiency, however, the reduction in annual miles driven may offset some of the environmental concerns...|$|E

The analysis indicates a rising research interest in the empirical micro-level models of demand for out-patient physician services that incorporate the size of patient payment. Overall, the size of patient payments, consumer socio-economic and demographic features, and quality of services provided emerge as important determinants of demand for out-patient physician services. However, there is a great variety in the modeling approaches and inconsistencies in the findings regarding the impact of price on demand for out-patient physician services. Hitherto, the empirical research fails to offer policy-makers a clear strategy on how to develop a country-specific model of demand for out-patient physician services suitable for the assessment of patient payment policies in their countries. In particular, theoretically important factors, such as provider behavior, consumer attitudes, experience and culture, and informal patient payments, are not considered. Although we recognize {{that it is difficult to}} measure these factors and to incorporate them in the demand models, it is apparent that there is a gap in research for the construction of effective patient payment schemes...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigate}} whether consumers accept dynamic pricing using a choice experiment. We estimate {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) {{from the results of}} a choice experiment. Then, we analyze the most preferable dynamic pricing rules for consumers. There are several previous studies related to our study. Borenstein (2006) estimated the number of consumers who take risk aversion action. Risk aversion implies the avoidance of an electric pricing rule with high volatility, such as real-time pricing (RTP). Borenstein (2006) found that 77 % of consumers investigated were risk averse. In addition, Borenstein (2013) found that consumers tend to remain in the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>fee</b> scheme. He also used field experiment data to analyze what characteristics of consumers lead them to switch to other electricity rates. As a result, he noted that low-income consumers tend to switch from a flat-rate scheme to a dynamic pricing scheme. A dynamic pricing scheme has the possibility to improve several energy problems, such as energy conservation and mitigation of CO 2 emissions. But, an effective dynamic pricing scheme requires the joining of several types of consumers (Kurakawa et al. 2016). Therefore, understanding consumer preferences for each dynamic pricing rule is important in actually implementing a dynamic pricing scheme. Furthermore, some researchers have noted that consumers may prefer an energy management system that automatically adjusts electricity usage to a dynamic pricing scheme. Therefore, we add the analysis of the preference for direct load control (DLC), which does not require the risky price change of electricity to consumers; instead, it automatically adjusts the rate based on use.|$|E
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{data from}} the 2006 - 2007 Oregon Road User Fee Pilot program to assess if and how urban form variables correlate with travel behavior changes that participants made {{in response to the}} mileage-based fee program. It finds that charging a noticeably higher fee for driving in congested conditions can successfully motivate households to reduce their VMT in those times and places where congestion is most a problem. Households in both traditional (mixed use, dense, transit-accessible) and suburban (single-use, low density) neighborhoods will likely reduce their peak-hour and overall travel under a charging scheme that charges a high-rate for peak-hour travel, though households in the traditional neighborhoods will do so more. It also finds that a mileage fee program that charges a high rate during the peak hour is likely to strengthen the underlying influence of urban form on travel behavior. In other words, land use probably will matter more to transportation planning if the nation shifts to a new paradigm of mileage-based financing and pricing system. For transportation policy-makers, this raises another layer of consideration when designing the optimal rate structure to achieve policy goals—either reduced VMT and congestion or sustained funding sources. For urban planners, this offers a wonderful opportunity to move towards a sustainable built environment through revised and compatible land use regulation under the context of a mileage-based fee. The research also reveals that program design could significantly affect a household’s response to a mileage-based fee program. Particularly in Portland, the establishment of an endowment account for participants actually increased household VMT when a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>fee</b> was charged, the opposite to policy-makers’ expectation. One possible explanation is that paying the mileage-based fees once a month, instead of paying the gas tax at each visit to the pump, may have encouraged households to drive more due to the reduced gas price at the pump...|$|E
40|$|This report explores {{public opinion}} on a new and {{promising}} concept—green transportation taxes and fees. These are taxes and fees set at variable rates, with higher rates for more polluting vehicles and lower rates for those that pollute less. This approach to transportation taxes and fees adapts the traditional transportation finance system to achieve two critical public benefits at once: encouraging drivers to choose more environmentally-friendly transportation options and raising revenue for needed transportation programs. To test public support for green transportation taxes and fees, the authors conducted a random telephone survey of 1, 500 Californians that asked respondents their views on five hypothetical tax and <b>fee</b> options: a <b>flat-rate</b> and a green vehicle registration <b>fee,</b> a <b>flat-rate</b> and a green mileage fee, and a “feebate” program for new vehicle purchases under which more-polluting vehicles would be charged a tax and less-polluting vehicles would receive a rebate. The survey {{results show that the}} concept of green transportation taxes and fees strongly appeals to Californians. The survey tested this in two ways: by testing support for the three hypothetical green transportation tax and fee policies, and also by comparing support levels for flat-rate versus green versions of two taxes. Majorities of the respondents supported all three green taxes and fees tested. Another striking finding from the survey is that support for the green taxes and fees did not vary greatly by population subgroups; a diverse range of Californians supported the green taxes and fees. An analysis comparing support for the green and <b>flat-rate</b> vehicle registration <b>fee</b> and feebate proposals confirmed that in every subgroup, more people within that subgroup supported the green than the flat version of the two taxes tested...|$|R
