The {{study of}} the <b>homoeologous</b> (duplicated) segments or chromosomes can facilitate insight into the evolutionary process of polyploidy {{and the development of}} genomic resources. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones as probes has commonly been used to provide a reliable cytological technique for chromosome identification. In polyploids, it also presents a useful approach for identification and localization of duplicated segments. Here, two types of BACs that contained the duplicated segments were isolated and analyzed in tetraploid cotton by FISH. Results Homologous and <b>homoeologous</b> BACs were isolated by way of SSR marker-based selection and then used to develop BAC-FISH probes. Duplicated segments in <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes were detected by FISH. The FISH and related linkage map results followed known reinforced the relationships of <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes in allotetraploid cotton, and presented a useful approach for isolation of <b>homoeologous</b> loci or segments and for mapping of monomorphic loci. It is very important to find that the large duplicated segments (homologous BACs) do exist between <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes, so the shot-gun approach for genome sequencing was unavailable for tetraploid cotton. However, without doubt, it will contain more information and promote the research for duplicated segments as well as the genome evolution in cotton.

This form of silencing can be tissue specific and may be linked to developmental or stress responses. Results Evidence was sought as to whether the frequency of <b>homoeologous</b> silencing in in vitro cultured wheat callus differ from that in differentiated organs, given that disorganized cells are associated with a globally lower level of DNA methylation. Using a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) platform to detect the pattern of expression of 20 <b>homoeologous</b> sets of single-copy genes known to be affected by this form of silencing in the root and/or leaf, we observed no silencing in any of the wheat callus tissue tested.

Unraveling the extent to which each intrinsic or extrinsic factor determines levels of diversity among genes, populations, and species is challenging, given the difficulty of isolating any single potentially important variable from all others.

Here we evaluate the pace of molecular evolution and intraspecific, intragenomic diversity in two species of allopolyploid Gossypium, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, using several hundred genes sequenced from multiple accessions of each species. Genic diversity in both species is low, having been influenced both by the polyploid bottleneck and a domestication bottleneck (for cultivated accessions), but with a directional bias in homoeolog diversity favoring the same genome in both allopolyploids. Total diversity is remarkably similar for the two <b>homoeologous</b> genomes overall, but the two copies of many gene pairs have accumulated statistically different diversity levels, and in a biased fashion with respect to genome. Domesticated accessions show reduced diversity in both genomes, as expected, but with a much greater reduction in one of the two <b>homoeologous</b> genomes. Furthermore, this biased reduction affects opposite <b>homoeologous</b> genomes in the two species. Interspecific introgression has played a role in shaping {{diversity within}} each species.

40|$|Abstract Background TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a {{powerful}} tool for reverse genetics, combining traditional chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput PCR-based mutation detection to discover induced mutations that alter protein function. The most popular mutation detection method for TILLING is a mismatch cleavage assay using the endonuclease CelI. For this method, locus-specific PCR is essential. Most wheat genes are present as three similar sequences with high homology in exons and low homology in introns. Locus-specific primers can usually be designed in introns. However, it is sometimes difficult to design locus-specific PCR primers in a conserved region with high homology among the three <b>homoeologous</b> genes, or in a gene lacking introns, or if information on introns is not available. Here we describe a mutation detection method which combines High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis of mixed PCR amplicons containing three <b>homoeologous</b> gene fragments and sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor ® software, aimed at simultaneous detection of mutations in three <b>homoeologous</b> genes. Results We demonstrate that High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis can be used in mutation scans in mixed PCR amplicons containing three <b>homoeologous</b> gene fragments. Combining HRM scanning with sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor ® is sensitive enough to detect a single nucleotide mutation in the heterozygous state in a mixed PCR amplicon containing three homoeoloci. The method was tested and validated in an EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate) -treated wheat TILLING population, screening mutations in the carboxyl terminal domain of the Starch Synthase II (SSII) gene. Selected identified mutations of interest can be further analysed by cloning to confirm the mutation and determine the genomic origin of the mutation. Conclusion Polyploidy is common in plants. Conserved regions of a gene often represent functional domains and have high sequence similarity between <b>homoeologous</b> loci. The method described here is a useful alternative to locus-specific based methods for screening mutations in conserved functional domains of <b>homoeologous</b> genes. This method can also be used for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) marker development and eco-TILLING in polyploid species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{recombination}} of <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes in allopolyploid {{species is}} central to understanding plant breeding and evolution. However, examining chromosome pairing in the allotetraploid Brassica napus has been hampered {{by the lack of}} chromosome-specific molecular probes. In this study, we establish the identification of all <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes of allopolyploid B. napus by using robust molecular cytogenetic karyotypes developed for the progenitor species Brassica rapa (A genome) and Brassica oleracea (C genome). The identification of every chromosome among these three Brassica species utilized genetically mapped bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) from B. rapa as probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). With this BAC-FISH data, a second karyotype was developed using two BACs that contained repetitive DNA sequences and the ubiquitous ribosomal and pericentromere repeats. Using this diagnostic probe mix and a BAC that contained a C-genome repeat in two successive hybridizations allowed for routine identification of the corresponding <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes between the A and C genomes of B. napus. When applied to the B. napus cultivar Stellar, we detected one chromosomal rearrangement relative to the parental karyotypes. This robust novel chromosomal painting technique will have biological applications for the understanding of chromosome pairing, <b>homoeologous</b> recombination, and genome evolution in the genus Brassica and will facilitate new applied breeding technologies that rely upon identification of chromosomes...|$|E

Heredity, 64 (1), 45 - 53 The diploid hybrid ryegrass, Lolium temulentum times L. perenne (2 n = 14), contains {{two sets of}} chromosomes which are structurally and genetically dissimilar. Whole-mount surface spreading of synaptonemal complexes from 35 pollen mother cell nuclei shows that chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase is highly irregular, with homoeologues and heterologues pairing together to form multivalents. These are eliminated, however, during meiotic prophase in favour of <b>homoeologous</b> bivalents. In addition, the length differential between <b>homoeologous</b> chromosomes is accommodated in a coordinated fashion and is absorbed into {{the structure of the}} synaptonemal complexes. The hybrid thus displays a remarkable capacity to eliminate synaptonemal complex irregularities and to produce <b>homoeologous</b> bivalents, which are functionally and morphologically almost indistinguishable from their homologous counterparts in the parents.

40|$|Intergeneric hybrids of fescues (Festuca spp.) and ryegrasses (Lolium spp.) {{are unique}} for {{the ability of}} their {{chromosomes}} to pair essentially freely in meiotic metaphase I (MI). At the same time, their chromosomes can be readily recognized by genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH). Past genome-wide observations suggested that this <b>homoeologous</b> pairing was not completely random. In this study we extend the analysis to all seven individual chromosomes of F. pratensis introgressed into autotetraploid L. multiflorum and show that for any F. pratensis chromosome the choice of an MI pairing partner depends on {{the identity of the}} remaining chromosomes present in the quadruplet. In monosomic introgressions, the choice of a homologous or <b>homoeologous</b> partner was completely random; in disomics there was a slight preference for homologous pairing. Pairing preference was similar for each chromosome, suggesting that pairing affinity of all chromosomes is essentially the same and no structural rearrangements differentiate the two genera. <b>Homoeologous</b> crossover rates for individual chromosomes were similar and they were consistently lower than expected {{on the basis of the}} MI pairing. High <b>homoeologous</b> MI pairing in these hybrids may be due to a very permissive system of chromosome pairing control that overlooks differences between the parental chromosomes. Given the ease of genome discrimination by GISH in the LoliumYFestuca hybrids, the differences in repetitive DNA sequences must be substantial. On th...|$|E

A {{haplotype}} map of allohexaploid wheat reveals distinct {{patterns of}} selection on <b>homoeologous</b> genomes. Genome Biology, 16 (1). doi: 10. 1186 /s 13059 - 015 - 0606 - 4 Background: Bread wheat is an allopolyploid species with a large, highly repetitive genome. To investigate {{the impact of}} selection on variants distributed among <b>homoeologous</b> wheat genomes and to build a foundation for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, we performed population-scale re-sequencing of a diverse panel of wheat lines. Results: A sample of 62 diverse lines was re-sequenced using the whole exome capture and genotyping-by-sequencing approaches. We describe the allele frequency, functional significance, and chromosomal distribution of 1. 57 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 161, 719 small indels. Our results suggest that duplicated <b>homoeologous</b> genes are under purifying selection. We find contrasting patterns of variation and inter-variant associations among wheat genomes; this, in addition to demographic factors, {{could be explained by}} differences in the effect of directional selection on duplicated homoeologs. Only {{a small fraction of the}} <b>homoeologous</b> regions harboring selected variants overlapped among the wheat genomes in any given wheat line. These selected regions are enriched for loci associated with agronomic traits detected in genome-wide association studies. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that directional selection in allopolyploids rarely acted on multiple parallel advantageous mutations across <b>homoeologous</b> regions, likely indicating that a fitness benefit could be obtained by a mutation at any one of the homoeologs. Additional advantageous variants in other homoelogs probably either contributed little benefit, or were unavailable in populations subjected to directional selection. We hypothesize that allopolyploidy may have increased the likelihood of beneficial allele recovery by broadening the set of possible selection targets. © 2015 Jordan et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{patterns}} of expression of <b>homoeologous</b> genes in hexaploid bread wheat have been intensively studied in recent years, but {{the interaction between}} structural genes and their <b>homoeologous</b> regulatory genes remained unclear. The question was as to whether, in an allopolyploid, this interaction is genome-specific, or whether regulation cuts across genomes. The aim {{of the present study}} was cloning, sequence analysis, mapping and expression analysis of F 3 H (flavanone 3 -hydroxylase – one of the key enzymes in the plant flavonoid biosynthesis pathway) homoeologues in bread wheat and study of the interaction between F 3 H and their regulatory genes homoeologues – Rc (red coleoptiles). Results PCR-based cloning of F 3 H sequences from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a wild tetraploid wheat (T. timopheevii) and their putative diploid progenitors was employed to localize, physically map and analyse the expression of four distinct bread wheat F 3 H copies. Three of these form a <b>homoeologous</b> set, mapping to the chromosomes of <b>homoeologous</b> group 2; they are highly similar to one another at the structural and functional levels. However, the fourth copy is less homologous, and was not expressed in anthocyanin pigmented coleoptiles. The presence of dominant alleles at the Rc- 1 <b>homoeologous</b> loci, which are responsible for anthocyanin pigmentation in the coleoptile, was correlated with F 3 H expression in pigmented coleoptiles. Each dominant Rc- 1 allele affected the expression of the three F 3 H homoeologues equally, but the level of F 3 H expression was dependent on the identity of the dominant Rc- 1 allele present. Thus, the <b>homoeologous</b> Rc- 1 genes contribute more to functional divergence than do the structural F 3 H genes. Conclusion The lack of any genome-specific relationship between F 3 H- 1 and Rc- 1 implies an integrative evolutionary process among the three diploid genomes, following the formation of hexaploid wheat. Regulatory genes probably contribute more to the functional divergence between the wheat genomes than do the structural genes themselves. This is in line with the growing consensus which suggests that although heritable morphological traits are determined by the expression of structural genes, it is the regulatory genes which are the prime determinants of allelic identity. </p...|$|E
