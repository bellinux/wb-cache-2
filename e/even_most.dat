5|$|Guy Fawkes, who {{was born}} and educated in York, {{was a member of}} a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its aim was to {{displace}} Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and <b>even</b> <b>most</b> of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke <b>even</b> <b>most</b> years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or <b>even</b> <b>most</b> of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now <b>even</b> <b>most</b> of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and <b>even</b> <b>most</b> modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the brief}} {{duration}} of his dynasty, Ibn Tulun's rule was a seminal event {{not only for}} Egypt, but for the entire Islamic world. For Egypt itself, his reign marks a turning point as {{the country for the}} first time since the Pharaohs ceased being a passive province subject to a foreign imperial power, and became once again a political actor in its own right. The new realm Ibn Tulun forged, encompassing Egypt and Syria as well as the Jazira and Cilicia, and to a lesser extent the eastern parts of the Maghreb, established a new political zone separated from the Islamic lands further east, restoring in a fashion the frontier that had existed between the Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid Persian realms in Antiquity. Egypt was the basis of Ibn Tulun's power; he paid particular attention to restoring its economy, as well as establishing an autonomous bureaucracy, army, and navy. These policies were continued by later Egypt-based regimes, the Ikhshidids (935–969) and eventually the Fatimids (969–1171), who likewise used Egypt's wealth to establish control over parts or <b>even</b> <b>most</b> of Syria. Indeed, as Thierry Bianquis remarks, the territory ruled by Ibn Tulun in Syria was remarkably similar to that controlled by the later Egypt-based regimes of Saladin and the Mamluk Sultanate.|$|E

25|$|As far as duration, depth, and the {{sequence}} of dives, the southern elephant seal is the best performing seal. In many regards, they exceed <b>even</b> <b>most</b> cetaceans.

The coping strategy is based on increased oxygen storage and reduced oxygen consumption.|$|E
25|$|The head in most insects is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium. The main exception is in those species whose larvae {{are not fully}} sclerotised, mainly some holometabola; but <b>even</b> <b>most</b> unsclerotised or weakly sclerotised larvae tend to have well sclerotised epicrania, for example the larvae of Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. The larvae of Cyclorrhapha however, tend to have hardly any head capsule at all.|$|E
25|$|While until 1930 {{almost all}} comics {{published}} in Belgium were either French or American, {{due to the}} success of Tintin in 1950 almost no foreign comics are published in Belgium anymore, and by 1960 many or <b>even</b> <b>most</b> comics read in other Western European countries (excluding the United Kingdom) are made by Belgians or for Belgian magazines.

25|$|It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that perpetuities, or securities with an indefinitely long maturity, are rare or unrealistic, and particularly {{those with a}} growing payment.

25|$|Atherosclerosis is {{asymptomatic}} {{for decades}} because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus {{there is no}} effect on blood flow. <b>Even</b> <b>most</b> plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs.
