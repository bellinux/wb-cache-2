5|$|<b>Dig</b> Me Out is {{the third}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on April 8, 1997, by Kill Rock Stars. The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. <b>Dig</b> Me Out marked the debut of Janet Weiss, who is the band's longest serving and current drummer. The music on the record was influenced by traditional rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy.|$|E

50|$|Although {{humans are}} capable of <b>digging</b> in sand and soil using their bare hands, <b>digging</b> is often more easily {{accomplished}} with tools. The most basic tool for <b>digging</b> is the shovel. In neolithic times and earlier a large animal's scapula (shoulder blade) was often used as a crude shovel. In modern times, shovels are typically made of metal, with a wooden handle. Because <b>digging</b> is a cutting process, particularly where the soil being dug contains plant roots, <b>digging</b> is aided by the shovel being sharpened.|$|R
40|$|In Alaskan alpine tundra, {{grizzly bears}} {{excavate}} deep holes {{in search of}} ground squirrels, but few studies have tested the importance of grizzlies, or other large mammals, in maintaining plant community structure. We examined 43 bear <b>digs,</b> asking how they affect plant species richness and diversity, recolonization patterns, and plants with different clonal growth strategies. Bears remove most vegetation from <b>digs,</b> and recovering <b>digs</b> had lower species richness than adjacent mature tundra. Mature tundra alone, however, had significantly fewer species than mature tundra and bear <b>digs</b> combined, suggesting that bear <b>digs</b> contribute to the overall richness of tundra communities. <b>Digs</b> develop the highest plant richness and diversity at intermediate ages, but even in new <b>digs</b> the overall species composition is similar to adjacent tundra. Plants of different clonal growth forms reacted differently to bear <b>digs.</b> The two species significantly more common in <b>digs</b> than elsewhere have a nonspreading (phalanx) clonal habit, whereas five of six plant species significantly more common in mature tundra are capable of rapid, diffuse (guerrilla) clonal growth. Overall, bear <b>digs</b> cause less pronounced effects on community composition than mammalian diggings in some other systems, possibly because subarctic alpine tundra is already characterized by high levels of abiotic disturbance...|$|R

To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to <b>dig</b> into the ground.

40|$|Fish {{demonstrate}} the greatest variety of parental care strategies within the animal kingdom. Fish parents seldom provision food for offspring, with some exceptions predominantly found in substrate-brooding Central American cichlids and mouth-brooding African cichlids. Here, we provide {{the first evidence}} of food provisioning in a substrate-brooding African cichlid Neolamprologus mondabu. This fish is a maternal substrate-brooding cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika, and feeds on benthic animals using unique techniques–individuals typically feed {{on the surface of}} sandy substrates, but also expose prey by <b>digging</b> up substrates with vigorous wriggling of their body and fins. Young also feed on benthos on the substrate surface, but only using the first technique. We observed that feeding induced by <b>digging</b> accounted for 30 % of total feeding bouts in adult females, demonstrating that <b>digging</b> is an important foraging tactic. However, parental females fed less frequently after <b>digging</b> than non-parental females, although both females stayed in pits created by <b>digging</b> for approximately 30 s. Instead, young gathered in the pit and fed intensively, suggesting that parental females provision food for young by means of <b>digging.</b> We tested this hypothesis by comparing the feeding frequency of young before and after <b>digging</b> that was simulated by hand, and observed that young doubled their feeding frequency after the simulated <b>digging.</b> This suggests that parental females engage in <b>digging</b> to uncover food items that are otherwise unavailable to young, an...|$|R
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B.

Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for.
