These activities, related {{to the emergence of}} shadow banking, greatly contribute to the volatility of bank operating revenues, but their impact on accounting returns is less clear (Stiroh and Rumble 2006). In this paper, we use a Canadian dataset to revisit the risk-return trade-off associated with banks OBS activities and study the evolution of the endo-geneity of banks decision to expand their market-oriented business lines. Consistent with the changing mix of noninterest income OBS activities generate, we identify a structural break in 1997 which coincides with an increased impact of endogeneity on banks returns, and which also leads to an <b>increased</b> return <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> (ROA) and a surge in banking risk. We trace the sources of the greater volatility of noninterest income to a tighter cointegrating relationship between noninterest income and stock market indices after 1997. Intro-ducing a new, robust estimation method based on a modification of the Hausman procedure, we find that neglecting endogeneity greatly underestimates the positive impact of shadow banking on bank accounting returns, even when the subprime crisis is considered. Our main results suggest that the influence of market-based activities on the risk-return trade-off might be larger than what was previously thought.

Previous research has proved that it is feasible to turn hardened steel to the same surface finish as grinding.

The residual stress profiles were observed to be primarily compressive. A discussion is presented to explain the formation of compressive residual stresses in hard turning. An experimental model is developed to represent the effect of precision hard turning parameters on residual stresses.
