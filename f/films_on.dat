40|$|Abstract: The {{composition}} and semiconducting {{properties of the}} passive <b>films</b> formed <b>on</b> Ni-(15, 30) Cr- 5 Mo alloys in pH 8. 5 buffer solution were examined. The depth concentration pro-file of passive <b>films</b> formed <b>on</b> Ni-(15, 30) Cr- 5 Mo in pH 8. 5 buffer solution showed that Mo enhances the enrichment of Cr. The Mott-Schottky plot for the passive <b>film</b> <b>on</b> Ni-(15, 30) Cr- 5 Mo closely resembled that for the <b>film</b> <b>on</b> Cr, whereas those for the less Cr-enriched <b>film</b> <b>on</b> Mo-free alloys showed similar behavior to that for the <b>film</b> <b>on</b> Ni. The acceptor density was reduced by increasing Cr content in Ni-(15, 30) Cr-(0, 5) Mo alloys, but addition of Mo considerably increased the acceptor density...|$|R
