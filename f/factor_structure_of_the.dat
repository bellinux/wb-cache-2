Research purpose: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was therefore to explore <b>the</b> psychometric properties <b>of</b> Setswana versions of three measures of psychological wellbeing, namely <b>the</b> Sense <b>of</b> Coherence Scale (SOC) (the 29 -item version) (Antonovsky, 1987), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larson & Griffen, 1985) and Affectometer 2 (AFM) (Kammann & Flett, 1983). Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was implemented for this study. Questionnaires were translated, back-translated and evaluated in a research-committee approach. A stratified sample of 738 Setswana-speaking participants completed the questionnaires in randomly selected sites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North West province of South Africa as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-disciplinary Transition and Health during Urbanisation of South Africans project.

40|$|Higher {{education}} is attracting more participation from an increasingly diverse student body. This diversity invites concerns on effective instructional delivery as <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> students’ engagement in learning now varies widely.

This project set out to develop a questionnaire, developed for {{higher education in the}} Japanese context, on a range <b>of</b> student dispositions. <b>The</b> scale was a five-point Likert instrument designed to interpret learners’ disengagement as an attitudinal disposition. The paper discusses <b>the</b> conceptual contours <b>of</b> disengagement as a student disposition that provided the basis for the context-specific scale items. It reports the procedures taken to obtain <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dataset. The questionnaire was administered to 145 engineering students in Japan.

5000|$|Because the NPI was {{originally}} based on DSM criteria for NPD, {{there has been}} much research on its factor structure. Raskin and Terry (1988) identified seven factors of the NPI (i.e., authority, superiority, exhibitionism, entitlement, vanity, [...] and self-sufficiency), mapping roughly onto the DSM criteria for NPD. Since then, several studies have further examined the <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NPI with varying results. For example, some studies report three factors; some report four factors. It is also often the case that factors of the NPI exhibit very low internal consistency (although the full scale exhibits acceptable reliability).

Compared to the NPI, one advantage of the single-item measure {{is that it does not}} seem to conflate narcissism with normal, or healthy, self-esteem.|$|E
5000|$|... from GERMAN: As {{a working}} {{definition}} for neuroscientific research, it might suffice to presume {{that most people}} have a strong intuition concerning which variability in their everyday wakeful state feels normal to them. This variability of experience is considered as normal fluctuation, while any state that is experienced to diverge significantly from it can be called an ASC. From an experimental perspective, it is also reasonable to compare ASC conditions to a baseline state - a state subjectively judged as average, or normal. The comparison with a ‘normal’ baseline requires that the ASC under investigation is of relatively short duration (minutes to hours), which differentiates ASCs from most pathological conditions. Importantly, it has been emphasized that an ASC is not a mere quantitative change in a single cognitive function (e.g. elevated arousal). Instead, it is a multidimensional phenomenon. Thereby, the relative intensity of multiple consciousness aspects constitutes a ‘phenomenological pattern’ characterizing a particular state. Such ‘patterns’ have also {{been referred to as}} relative changes in the ‘(basic) dimensions of consciousness’. For empirical research, such patterns correspond to a multivariate combination of independent ‘consciousness factors’, which can be quantified via questionnaires. The ‘phenomenological pattern’ results from the <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied psychometric assessment, i.e. the individual ratings, or factor scores, of a questionnaire.|$|E
