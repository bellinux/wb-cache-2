30|$|In general, an ND-CCC is {{established}} by selecting one of available channels {{in a network}} or by dividing SUs into different groups or clusters that have different ND-CCCs. In C-MAC [14] and EDA MAC [15], a rendezvous channel {{is established}} and channels are divided {{into a number of}} superframes. The superframes consist of a beacon period and a data transmission period. In AMAC [16], communication pairs exchange the prioritized channel list and select a different ND-CCC in the list. So, different SU pairs have different ND-CCCs. A network can be divided into groups and an ND-CCC is selected within a group in CogMesh MAC [17] and <b>HD</b> <b>MAC</b> [18] protocols. This is because it is less likely to find a common channel throughout the whole network. However, it has to be noted that ND-CCCs can still be affected by problems in the D-CCC. Unlike D-CCCs, however, ND-CCCs are not fixed. In addition, there can be many ND-CCCs in a network. So, the extent of adverse effects is smaller.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio networks in which FD secondary users (SUs) perform channel contention followed by concurrent spectrum sensing and transmission, and transmission only with maximum power {{in two different}} stages (called the FD sensing and transmission stages, respectively) in each contention and access cycle. The proposed FD cognitive MAC (FDC-MAC) protocol does not require synchronization among SUs and it efficiently utilizes the spectrum and mitigates the self-interference in the FD transceiver. We then develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the FDC-MAC protocol where both half-duplex (HD) transmission (HDTx) and FD transmission (FDTx) modes are considered in the transmission stage. Then, we study the FDC-MAC configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the spectrum sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage where we prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to achieve the maximum throughput and we develop an algorithm to configure the proposed FDC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate the characteristic of the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation quality on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the FDC-MAC protocol with respect to existing half-duplex MAC (<b>HD</b> <b>MAC)</b> and single-stage FD MAC protocols.

40|$|As known, for {{the ring}} structure, the two properties: {{association}} and commutation respect to +, {{can be replaced}} with the “association-commutation” property: (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d). This leads to two ways to construct the ring cohomology: cohomology for rings which are regarded as algebras due to Shukla [Sh], and ring cohomology due to Mac Lane [Mac]. The ring structure has been categorized by the definition of an Ann-category [4]. Each congruence class of Ann-categories {{is characterized by a}} cohomology class of structures (Theorem 4. 3 [4]). For regular Ann-categories, this class is (R, M) (Theorem 4. 4 [5]). In the general case, this bijective to the group H 3 Sh group is replaced with the group <b>H</b> 3 <b>Mac</b> (R, M) (Theorem 7. 6 [7]). In [1], authors have modified the definition of an Ann-category to be the one of a categorical ring, where the condition (Ann- 1) is omitted, and the compatibility of the operation ⊗ with the associativity and commutativity constraints respect to + is replaced with the compatibility of the operation ⊗ with the “associativity- commutativity ” constraint. Categorical rings have been classified by the Mac Lane cohomology group <b>H</b> 3 <b>Mac</b> (R, M). There are 2 problems emerged: Firstly, do the sets of categorical rings and Ann-categories coincide? Secondly, in the case that these sets can not be proved to coincide, is it possible to prove the existence of the bijection between the set of congruence classes of pre-sticked Ann-categories of the type (R, M) and the group <b>H</b> 3 <b>Mac</b> (R, M) ? We have completely solved both of these problems. In [6], authors have showed that the set of Ann-categories is a subset of the set of categorical rings, and these two sets coincide if and only if the operation ⊗ in each categorical ring is compatible with the unitivity constraints of the operation ⊕. (This condition is also called the condition (U)). A question is raised: May the condition (U) be deduced from the axiomatics of a categorical ring? The second problem has been solved in [7]. After that, in [2], authors have proved that the condition (U) is always satisfied in a categorical ring, and therefore the two sets of the categories coincide. However, authors have made a mistake in the proof of the Lemma. 1 2 O...|$|R

40|$|An {{intestinal}} ecosystem {{has three}} major actors, i. e., the macroorganism, the microflora and the environment. Influences of some exogenous factors on {{functions of the}} intestinal microbes and their interactions within the ecosystem in vivo, have been studied by utilizing the so-called microflora-associated characteristic (MAC) / germ-free animal characteristic (GAC) concept. The parameters were bile acid, urobilinogen, cholesterol faecal tryptic activity (FTA) mucin, beta-aspartylglycine, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The establisment of <b>MACs</b> <b>h</b> 35 germ-free rats was followed. The microbes were introduced in different ways and a faecal enema and social contacts with conventional rats gave rapidly an development of microbial functions. The establishment could be clustered into two groups, I) a rapid development probably depending on the microbes involved ll) a wider time range, probably depending on the way of introduction. The influence of diet was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease, receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in healthy volunteers given a balanced diet, enteral nutrition (EN), by following six MACs. The results showed greater influence of TPN than EN on bile acids, cholesterol and FTA. Diarrhoea {{is one of the}} most common side-effects of antimicrobial treatment, so-called antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD). SCFAs were investigated in 31 AAD patients and the total amount SCFAs and their distribution were significantly changed compared to healthy adults. Five other MACs were also studied and formation of coprostanol and urobilinogen and faecal tryptic activity were significantly altered in the AAD patients compared to healthy persons. Six MACs were studied in nine AAD patients given a faecal enema. Most of the patients were cured within 4 days. No relapses occurred within 18 months. Different probiotics have been used in order to avoid diarrhoea connected with antimicrobial treatment and an investigation was performed to evaluate the influence of a probiotic on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. A suspension of Lactobacillus delbruekii and Streptococcus thermophilus (LS) was given to 20 rats together with and without clindamycin. This antibiotic has a pronounced effect on most <b>MACs</b> <b>h</b> studies of healthy human and showed similar influence in rats on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. The micbes per se in LS are not claimed to 7 alpha-dehydroxylate bile acids. In the present study, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation was significantly reduced in the rats receiving clindamycin alone, but concomitantly use of LS reduced significantly the antimicrobial effect. Thus, the probiotics significantly influenced on a MAC not related to the microbes per se. In conclusion, the first contacts with microbes are of importance for the establishment of intestinal ecosystems. The metabolic activities of an intestinal ecosystem can be influenced by several exogenous factors such as diet and antimicrobial drugs. Probiotics as well as enemas containing a species-specific faecal flora may restore altered functions. The intestinal ecosystem is a complex interplay, with all main actors involved in maintaining a "balanced unbalance...|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature of}} many {{different}} organisms causing bacteremia {{is the ability to}} avoid the bactericidal effects of normal human serum. In Haemophilus influenzae encapsulated strains are particularly serum resistant; however, we found that a nonencapsulated strain (R 2866) isolated from the blood of an immunocompetent child with meningitis who had been successfully immunized with H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine was serum resistant. Since serum resistance usually involves circumventing the action of the complement system, we defined the deposition of various complement components on the surfaces of this H. influenzae strain (R 2866), a nonencapsulated avirulent laboratory strain (Rd), and a virulent type b encapsulated strain (Eagan). Membrane attack complex (MAC) accumulation correlated with the loss of bacterial viability; correspondingly, the rates of MAC deposition on the serum-sensitive strain Rd and the serum-resistant strains differed. Analysis of cell-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG), C 1 q, C 3 b, and C 5 b indicated that serum-resistant <b>H.</b> influenzae prevents <b>MAC</b> accumulation by delaying the synthesis of C 3 b through the classical pathway. Among the initiators of the classical pathway, IgG deposition contributes most of the C 3 convertase activity necessary to start the cascade ending with MAC deposition. Despite similar IgG binding, strain R 2866 delays C 3 convertase activity compared to strain Rd. We conclude that strain R 2866 can persist in the bloodstream, in part by inhibiting or delaying C 3 deposition on the cell surface, escaping complement mediated killing...|$|R

The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} cognitive dysfunction after controlled hypotensive and normotensive anesthesia in middle aged patients undergoing septoplasty. MethodsSixty patients (ASA I–II), 21 to 50 years were included in the study, undergoing septoplasty operation. Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups, namely group (A), who were generally anesthetized and associated with controlled hypotension and group (B), who were generally anesthetized and associated with local anesthesia. Heart rates, blood pressure and oxygen saturation were measured throughout the operation. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for evaluation of cognitive functions preoperatively and postoperatively. ResultsRegarding cognitive function, there were no statistically significant differences between both groups in preoperative and after 24 h of postoperative period, but there were statistically significant decrease in group (A) in relation to group (B) after 30 minutes and 60 minutes and the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in group (A) was 23. 3 % after 30 min, 13. 3 % after 60 min and 6. 6 % after 24 h, but in the other group (B) there were no recorded cases of cognitive dysfunction at 30 min, 60 min and 24 <b>h.</b> ConclusionIncreasing isoflurane <b>MAC</b> and using controlled hypotension to get bloodless field can affect the cognitive function appear in MMSE score but light volatile anesthetic combined with regional anesthesia with local vasoconstrictors is better regime to get better postoperative cognitive function...|$|R

As a test of the validity of this model, alveolar macrophages were isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavages of 36 patients who had AIDS or an AIDS-related condition or were considered to be at risk for AIDS.

The high resistance state of such membranes was impaired after assembly {{of large numbers of}} C 5 b- 8 complexes as indicated by the appearance of rapidly fluctuating membrane currents. The C 5 b- 8 induced conductance was voltage dependent and rectifying at higher voltages. Addition of C 9 to membranes with very few C 5 b- 8 complexes caused appearance of few discrete single channels of low conductance (5 - 25 pS) but after some time very large (greater than 0. 5 nS) jumps in conductance could be monitored. This high macroscopic conductance state was dominated by 125 -pS channels having a lifetime of approximately 1 s.

40|$|Objectives: Skin notations {{are used}} as a hazard {{identification}} tool to flag chemicals associated with a potential risk related to transdermal penetration. The transparency and rigorousness of the skin notation assignment process have recently been questioned. We compared different approaches proposed as criteria for these notations {{as a starting point}} for improving and systematizing current practice. Methods: In this study, skin notations, dermal acute lethal dose 50 in mammals (LD 50 s) and two dermal risk indices derived from previously published work were compared using the lists of Swiss maximum allowable concentrations (MACs) and threshold limit values (TLVs) from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). The indices were both based on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) estimation of transdermal fluxes. One index compared the cumulative dose received through skin given specific exposure surface and duration to that received through lungs following inhalation 8 <b>h</b> at the <b>MAC</b> or TLV. The other index estimated the blood level increase caused by adding skin exposure to the inhalation route at kinetic steady state. Dermal-to-other route ratios of LD 50 were calculated as secondary indices of dermal penetrability. Results: The working data set included 364 substances. Depending on the subdataset, agreement between the Swiss and ACGIH skin notations varied between 82 and 87 %. Chemicals with a skin notation were more likely to have higher dermal risk indices and lower dermal LD 50 than chemicals without a notation (probabilities between 60 and 70 %). The risk indices, based on cumulative dose and kinetic steady state, respectively, appeared proportional up to a constant independent of chemical-specific properties. They agreed well with dermal LD 50 s (Spearman correlation coefficients − 0. 42 to − 0. 43). Dermal-to-other routes LD 50 ratios were moderately associated with QSAR-based transdermal fluxes (Spearman correlation coefficients − 0. 2 to − 0. 3). Conclusions: The plausible but variable relationship between current skin notations and the different approaches tested confirm the need to improve current skin notations. QSAR-based risk indices and dermal toxicity data might be successfully integrated in a systematic alternative to current skin notations for detecting chemicals associated with potential dermal risk in the workplac...|$|R
40|$|Cells of the {{macrophage}} lineage {{are considered}} to be of special importance in the defense of the host against tumor development and spread. Immunotherapeutic strategies to stimulate macrophage (MAC) tumor cytotoxicity make use of activating compounds such as gamma-interferon which are given systemically. However, there are several lines of evidence that in malignant disease the generation of cytotoxic effector MACs is impaired. Both defective cell maturation and loss of responsiveness to activation are described. Here, a first clinical phase I trial of adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients using autologous MACs generated in vitro from blood monocytes (MOs) is reported. Mononuclear cells were isolated by cytapheresis and density centrifugation and cultured in hydrophobic Teflon bags for 7 days with 2 % autologous serum and recombinant human gamma-interferon being present for the last 18 <b>h.</b> Cytotoxic MO-derived <b>MACs</b> were then purified by countercurrent elutriation and reinfused into the patient. A total of 72 therapies have been performed with patients being treated i. v. (n = 8) and i. p. (n = 7). In vitro generated MACs proved to be mature as judged by the expression of maturation-associated surface molecules (MAX antigens, CD 16, CD 51, CD 71), were cytotoxic to U 937 tumor cells, and were efficient secretory cells. Cell dose escalation was performed in the first patients beginning with 10 (8) MACs to finally infuse the total number of cells recovered from one single cycle of isolation and culture. MAC yield varied from 1 to 17 x 10 (8) representing 13 - 79 % of MOs initially seeded. Adoptive MAc transfer was well tolerated. Side effects observed were low-grade fever (less than 38. 5 degrees C), induction of the coagulation cascade, and abdominal discomfort after i. p. application. The procoagulant activity of MAC autografts was cell dose dependent and demonstrated by detection of circulating fibrin monomers and thrombin-antithrombin complexes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Skin notations {{are used}} as a hazard {{identification}} tool to flag chemicals associated with a potential risk related to transdermal penetration. The transparency and rigorousness of the skin notation assignment process have recently been questioned. We compared different approaches proposed as criteria for these notations {{as a starting point}} for improving and systematizing current practice. METHODS: In this study, skin notations, dermal acute lethal dose 50 in mammals (LD(50) s) and two dermal risk indices derived from previously published work were compared using the lists of Swiss maximum allowable concentrations (MACs) and threshold limit values (TLVs) from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). The indices were both based on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) estimation of transdermal fluxes. One index compared the cumulative dose received through skin given specific exposure surface and duration to that received through lungs following inhalation 8 <b>h</b> at the <b>MAC</b> or TLV. The other index estimated the blood level increase caused by adding skin exposure to the inhalation route at kinetic steady state. Dermal-to-other route ratios of LD(50) were calculated as secondary indices of dermal penetrability. RESULTS: The working data set included 364 substances. Depending on the subdataset, agreement between the Swiss and ACGIH skin notations varied between 82 and 87 %. Chemicals with a skin notation were more likely to have higher dermal risk indices and lower dermal LD(50) than chemicals without a notation (probabilities between 60 and 70 %). The risk indices, based on cumulative dose and kinetic steady state, respectively, appeared proportional up to a constant independent of chemical-specific properties. They agreed well with dermal LD(50) s (Spearman correlation coefficients - 0. 42 to - 0. 43). Dermal-to-other routes LD(50) ratios were moderately associated with QSAR-based transdermal fluxes (Spearman correlation coefficients - 0. 2 to - 0. 3). CONCLUSIONS: The plausible but variable relationship between current skin notations and the different approaches tested confirm the need to improve current skin notations. QSAR-based risk indices and dermal toxicity data might be successfully integrated in a systematic alternative to current skin notations for detecting chemicals associated with potential dermal risk in the workplace.

De Smet, I. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2015 Journal of Experimental Botany 66175367 - 5374 <![CDATA[In the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, over 1000 putative genes encoding small, presumably secreted, signalling peptides can be recognized. However, a major obstacle in identifying the function of genes encoding small signalling peptides is the limited number of available loss-of-function mutants. To overcome this, a promising new tool, antagonistic peptide technology, was recently developed. Here, this antagonistic peptide technology was tested on selected CLE peptides and the related IDA peptide and its usefulness in the context of studies of peptide function discussed. Based on the analyses, it was concluded that the antagonistic peptide approach is not the ultimate means to overcome redundancy or lack of loss-of-function lines. However, information collected using antagonistic peptide approaches (in the broad sense) can be very useful, but these approaches do not work in all cases and require a deep insight on the interaction between the ligand and its receptor to be successful. This, as well as peptide ligand structure considerations, should be taken into account before ordering a wide range of synthetic peptide variants and/or generating transgenic plants...|$|R
