5|$|These successes enabled Emperor Constantine V (741–775) {{to shift}} the fleet from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea during his campaigns against the Bulgars in the 760s. In 763, a fleet of 800 ships {{carrying}} 9,600 cavalry and some infantry sailed to Anchialus, where he scored a significant victory, but in 766, a second fleet, allegedly of 2,600 ships, again bound for Anchialus, sank en route. At the same time however, the Isaurian emperors undermined Byzantium's naval strength: with the Arab threat <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moment, and with the largely iconodule naval themes staunchly opposed to their iconoclastic policies, the emperors reduced the navy's size and downgraded the naval themes.|$|E

25|$|Like rural Alberta, Calgary {{has always}} <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most right-wing {{party on the}} ballot since the 1993 election, with one exception: Progressive Conservative Joe Clark in Calgary Centre in 2000, with his notability of being a former prime {{minister}} and the controversy of Stockwell Day's stances on same-sex marriage being an issue that caused many voters in that riding {{to turn away from}} the Canadian Alliance candidate Eric Lowther and support Clark instead. With Clark having retired by the next election, Calgary returned to a Conservative sweep in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011. The Conservatives won an outright majority of the votes cast in each Calgary riding from 2004 to 2011, with vote-splitting of the residual minority of the vote among the Liberals, NDP and Greens causing none of the races to even be close.|$|E
50|$|In the Survival Challenge, each Limbo captives had {{to select}} a target (between an egg, a grapefruit, a melon, a {{pineapple}} and a watermelon) and had only two shots to make the target.

As a result, they all had to eat in the dark. Despite having to do the forfeit, the Limbo captives made a bad situation fun by having a food fight in the dark.|$|R

Both of them partner with the Santa Fe local government, its school system, and the ones nearby, and with businesses and private donors, to provide programs for the entire year. The full-time and part-time counselors visit school campuses during the academic year in Santa Fe and Hitchcock to hold programs for approximately 800 students regularly.

2500|$|Louth's JP Rooney and Shane Lennon both missed {{opportunities}} in the first half. Louth dominated the second half, though spurned numerous opportunities to take a commanding lead over Meath. Rooney scored a goal with seven minutes of the game left. Meath converted two long-range free kicks from Cian Ward, but Louth still led by {{one point in the}} final minute. Louth's Colm Judge was sent off in the 69th minute for a second bookable offence. Then came the controversial goal by Joe Sheridan in the third minute of stoppage time. The ball was kicked into the square by Graham Reilly. It came out to Seamus Kenny, who could have <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> point, but saw a goal chance and shot. But the ball was blocked by Louth captain Paddy Keenan, and fell into the square, towards Louth full-back Dessie Finnegan. But Finnegan failed to clear and the ball went straight to Joe Sheridan, who fell over the goal line and then threw the ball into the net – both illegal moves. Sheridan was also [...] "inside the square" [...] at the time the ball reached him, in a third illegal move. Yet the goal was allowed {{and all of a sudden}} Meath were winning by two points. Referee Sludden checked with the umpire and did not change his mind, blowing his whistle for full-time soon after with the score at Meath 1–12: Louth 1–10, much to the disappointment of everyone associated with Louth. TV replays immediately demonstrated that the referee was incorrect when he awarded the goal to Meath.|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 World Sportscar Championship season {{started the}} same way that 1976 had <b>gone.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> 500km of Dijon, Tom Charnell and Ian Bracey drove a Hart 420R-engined B31, but retired due to a {{flywheel}} failure after 14 laps. For the 500 km of Monza, three B31s were entered: Martin Raymond and John Blanckley entered a DFV-engined car, Chandler Ibec International-Team Lloyds entered Bracey and Tony Charnell in the Hart-engined car, and Claudio Francisci partnered Giuseppe Fiaccadori in the remaining B31, which was fitted with a 1600cc Cosworth engine. For the first time since 1975, the B31 finished a WSC race; although Raymond and Blanckley did not attend, Francisci and Fiaccadori finished eighth overall, and fifth in the Sports 2000 class, whilst Bracey and Charnell finished immediately behind them, and won the Sports 1800 class. For the 400 km of Vallelunga, Francisci entered himself once more in the 1600cc Cosworth-engined B31, whilst Blanckley and Rolf Götz entered the DFV-engined car. Although Blanckley and Götz did not attend, Francisci finished fourth overall, and won the Sports 1600 class. A 2-litre Cosworth FVD-engined B31 was then entered by Chandler Ibec International-Team Lloyds at the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans, the first time a B31 had been used in the endurance event. Charnell, Bracey and Robin Smith were selected to drive the car, but the team retired after 21 laps due to a fuel pump failure. Five B31s were entered in the 500 km of Le Castellet; Mogil Motors entered Charnell and Robin Smith in a 2-litre Cosworth FVC-engined car, whilst three 2-litre Chrysler-Simca straight-4 engined cars were entered (Michel Pignard, Michel Dubois and Jean-Louis Bos in one, Albert Dufréne and François Servanin in a second, and Jean-Pierre Jaussaud partnered Jacques Henry (F) in the other car) and Raymond entered himself and Götz in the DFV-engined car. Jassaud and Henry finished third overall, and won the Sports 2000 class, whilst Charnell and Smith finished right behind them, the two other Chrysler-Simca-engined cars retired, and the pairing of Raymond and Götz once again did not compete in the race. For the 250 km of Imola, Francisci partnered [...] "Robin Hood" [...] in a 1.6-litre Cosworth FVA-engined car, and Blanckley entered himself and Götz in the DFV car; although the latter pairing once again did not attend the race, [...] "Robin Hood" [...] and Francisci finished eleventh overall, and third in the Sports 1600 class.|$|E
