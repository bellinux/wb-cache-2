5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{closely related}} to the birds. Since the late 19th century, it has been accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on this assessment, suggesting instead that it is a non-avialan dinosaur {{closely related to}} the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (Microraptor, Sinornithosaurus, and Velociraptor) and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including Microraptor and Velociraptor) {{may have been}} nocturnal predators, while Sinornithosaurus is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout the day at short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in Microraptor <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on the inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage {{are known to be}} nocturnal.|$|E

For example, on 4th Street the street lights are designed as old lamp posts and there are ornamented trash cans with a fleur-de-lis symbol at frequent intervals, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts on the sidewalks, Ouerbacker Court <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> iron decorative gates, and several other streets have basic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{widely accepted}} animal fossils are rather modern-looking cnidarians, possibly from around , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation {{can only be}} dated approximately. The identification {{of some of these}} as embryos of animals has been contested, but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals. Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged. Although the Ediacaran fossil Charnia used to be classified as a jellyfish or sea pen, more recent study of growth patterns in Charnia and modern cnidarians <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on this hypothesis, leaving only the Canadian polyp, Haootia, as the only bona-fide cnidarian body fossil from the Ediacaran. Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks, except in lagerstätten that preserved soft-bodied animals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5minutes. Analysis {{of the data}} indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April–May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR–PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold, placing it firmly in group 12.|$|E

5|$|Those {{opposed to}} the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on this.|$|E
5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he <b>has</b> <b>cast</b> without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E

25|$|While there are, in total, five {{paintings}} of card players by Cézanne, {{the final three}} works were similar in composition and number of players (two), causing them to sometimes be grouped together as one version.

25|$|Maori {{tradition}} tells {{first of}} a people called Kahui Tipua living in the area, then Te Rapuwai, semi-legendary but considered to be historical.
