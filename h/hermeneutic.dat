5|$|Historically, three <b>hermeneutic</b> {{approaches}} {{have been used}} among Churches of Christ.|$|E
5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} <b>hermeneutic</b> writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the <b>hermeneutic</b> style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E
5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the <b>hermeneutic</b> style was {{cultivated}} energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The impetus for the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|The artistic {{workshops}} {{established by}} Æthelwold reached {{a high standard}} of craftsmanship in manuscript illustration, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England and on the Continent. In his monasteries, learning reached a high standard, producing competent prose and poetry in the elaborate <b>hermeneutic</b> style of Latin favoured in tenth-century England. His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hermeneutic</b> {{style is}} {{a style of}} Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the {{extensive}} use of unusual and arcane words, especially derived from Greek. The style is first found {{in the work of}} Apuleius in the second century, and then in several late Roman writers. In the early medieval period, some leading Continental scholars were exponents, including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, <b>hermeneutic,</b> and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{style is}} found in several centres on the Continent in the tenth century. In Italy, the leading proponents were Liutprand of Cremona, Eugenius Vulgarius and Atto of Vercelli. In Germany, works which display it include the {{anonymous}} Gesta Apollonnii and the letters of Froumond of Tegernsee. French works which display the <b>hermeneutic</b> style include Dudo of Saint-Quentin's Gesta Normanniae Ducum and the Libellus Sacerdotalis by Lios Monocus.|$|E
5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, <b>hermeneutic,</b> tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>hermeneutic</b> {{therapists}} have posited a {{name for}} the efforts to utilize ontological hermeneutics as a psychotherapy: relational and compassionate psychotherapy (RCP). It is not a separate therapy from hermeneutics, but rather a continuation of previous efforts to bring <b>hermeneutic</b> theory to psychotherapy. The authors point out that RCP {{can be used as a}} grounding theory for assimilative integration to govern the use of other evidence-based interventions (such as CBT and DBT).|$|E

25|$|Progressive creationism {{can be held}} in {{conjunction}} with <b>hermeneutic</b> approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the day-age creationism or framework/metaphoric/poetic views.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermeneutic</b> {{therapists}} {{also explain}} that counselors subscribing to other therapies (e.g. CBT, DBT, Existentialism, Trauma Informed Care, etc.) can follow this model without subscribing to RCP.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, day-age creationism {{is not so}} much {{a version}} of creationism as a <b>hermeneutic</b> option which may be {{combined}} with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.|$|E
25|$|Since the client's life is his to live, {{and not the}} therapist's, <b>hermeneutic</b> {{counseling}} {{states that}} therapists must {{be open to the}} horizons of the individuals they work with, even when their horizon conflicts with the therapist's. <b>Hermeneutic</b> theory states that this {{is an important part of}} understanding that client resistance to therapeutic intervention is not always a defiant or oppositional act as mainstream therapies would say. Instead, an understanding of client resistance is re-conceptualized as part of the dialogical process and effort for both client and therapist to learn how to relate to one another authentically and arrive at contextual truth and meaning for the client.|$|E
25|$|The Protestant reformation <b>hermeneutic</b> {{inclined}} {{some of the}} Reformers, including John Calvin and Martin Luther, {{and later}} Protestants toward a literal reading of the Bible as translated, believing in an ordinary day, and maintaining this younger-Earth view.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{the primary}} tasks of sociological {{analysis}} are the following: (1) The <b>hermeneutic</b> explication and mediation of divergent {{forms of life}} within descriptive metalanguages of social science; (2) Explication of the production and reproduction of society as the accomplished outcome of human agency.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{texts of}} Kabbalah were {{once part of}} an ongoing oral tradition. The written texts are obscure and {{difficult}} for readers who are unfamiliar with Jewish spirituality which assumes extensive knowledge of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Midrash (Jewish <b>hermeneutic</b> tradition) and Halakha (practical Jewish law).|$|E
25|$|Gadamer {{writes that}} human {{tradition}} and reason {{can serve as}} a standard of measure for testing uncovered truths and avoiding relativism. Heidegger states that we can avoid relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, or something that is already given in existence that informs our theorizing. Additionally, <b>hermeneutic</b> psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E
25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) {{there will always be}} a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables <b>hermeneutic</b> therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, {{there will always be a}} distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. <b>Hermeneutic</b> counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E
25|$|Even though Gadamer's {{interpretation}} of Heidegger has been questioned, {{there is little}} doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the <b>hermeneutic</b> circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodox Christian {{theology}} is the theology particular to the Eastern Orthodox Church (officially the Orthodox Catholic Church). It {{is characterized by}} monotheistic Trinitarianism, belief in the Incarnation of the essentially divine Logos or only-begotten Son of God, a balancing of cataphatic theology with apophatic theology, a <b>hermeneutic</b> defined by a polyvalent Sacred Tradition, a concretely catholic ecclesiology, a robust theology of the person, and a principally recapitulative and therapeutic soteriology.|$|E
25|$|According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid {{interpretations of}} the written Torah were {{revealed}} to Moses at Sinai in oral form, and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to <b>hermeneutic</b> principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.|$|E
25|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} {{research methods}} include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. Qualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or critiques of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes <b>hermeneutic</b> and critical aims can {{give rise to}} quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of Nazi voting or Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E
25|$|Since theorists of {{literature}} often draw {{on a very}} heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Even among those listed below, many scholars combine methods {{from more than one}} of these approaches (for instance, the deconstructive approach of Paul de Man drew on a long tradition of close reading pioneered by the New Critics, and de Man was trained in the European <b>hermeneutic</b> tradition).|$|E
25|$|Earlier in England in 1956 {{the term}} Pop Art {{was used by}} Lawrence Alloway for {{paintings}} that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the <b>hermeneutic</b> and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of David Hockney whose paintings emerged from England during the 1960s like A Bigger Splash, (see above) and the works of Richard Hamilton, Peter Blake, and Eduardo Paolozzi, are considered seminal examples in the movement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermeneutic</b> {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is not}} through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a <b>hermeneutic</b> approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Hillel called {{attention}} to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles {{in the interpretation of}} laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the <b>hermeneutic</b> rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet ha-Shachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermeneutic</b> {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address these}} issues and limitations because, as these authors state, it is a comprehensive theory of human nature, and it is an open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. What this means is that therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover truths about clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of the Bible and slavery {{in the era of}} the Civil War was never a simple question. The issue involved the American expression of a Reformed literal <b>hermeneutic,</b> the failure of hermeneutical alternatives to gain cultural authority, and the exercise of deeply entrenched intuitive racism, as well as the presence of Scripture as an authoritative religious book and slavery as an inherited social-economic relationship. The North– forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create– lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to determine what the Bible said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragedy of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E
25|$|All the <b>hermeneutic</b> rules {{scattered}} {{through the}} Talmudim and Midrashim {{have been collected}} by Malbim in Ayyelet HaShachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, {{who was the first}} to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though he possibly amplified them. They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermeneutic</b> {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E
