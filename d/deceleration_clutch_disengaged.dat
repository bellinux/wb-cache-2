50|$|When {{the engine}} starts, the car pauses for 11 s - if {{equipped}} with a manual gearbox, 6 s in neutral (with clutch engaged) and 5 s in the 1st gear (with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged)</b> - then slowly accelerates to 15 km/h in 4 s, cruises at constant speed for 8 s, brakes to a full stop in 5 s (manual: last 3 s with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged),</b> then stops for 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, then 5 s in the 1st gear).|$|R
50|$|This {{particular}} {{cam assembly}} has a cam that rotates a full turn for each operation; it might operate the backspace, basket shift, or carriage-return <b>clutch</b> <b>disengage</b> mechanism. Cams for typing characters rotated {{only half a}} turn, the halves of course being identical.|$|R

50|$|Finally, at 316 s the car slowly accelerates to 120 km/h in 20 s, cruises for 10 s, {{then slowly}} brakes {{to a full}} stop in 34 s (manual: in the 5th or 6th gear, last 10 s with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged),</b> and idles for another 20 s (manual: in neutral).|$|R
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages</b> {{the chain}} {{from the engine}} when the engine is only at idling speed, engaging the drive automatically when the throttle is squeezed and the engine is at full speed. The purpose of this clutch is to avoid having a moving chain when the saw is idling and temporarily not cutting. At idle the chain should not move.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and third gear (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages</b> and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues {{in the same manner}} for the remaining forward gears.|$|R
50|$|At 49 s, the car slowly accelerates to 32 km/h in 12 s (manual: 5 s in 1st gear, 2 s gear change, then 5 s in the 2nd gear), cruises for 24 s, slowly brakes to a {{full stop}} in 11 s (manual: last 3 s with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged),</b> then pauses for another 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, 5 s in the 1st gear).|$|R
50|$|On sitting {{astride the}} Panda, ones first {{impression}} is immediately of how small the moped feels with its 23-inch wheels and upright riding position. Starting {{the machine is}} easy with a push-down button choke on the Bing carburettor and decompressor lever on the right hand handlebar. Once started on its stand with the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged,</b> the choke is reset by fully opening the twist-grip throttle momentarily.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and third gear (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages</b> and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues {{in the same manner}} for the remaining forward gears.|$|R
5000|$|Overrunning clutch or freewheel: If some {{external}} force makes the driven member rotate {{faster than the}} driver, the <b>clutch</b> effectively <b>disengages.</b> Examples include: ...|$|R
50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaging</b> the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both <b>clutches</b> <b>disengage</b> simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The SKYACTIV-Drive is {{a family}} of {{automatic}} transmissions, named SKY-Drive.Mazda rejected dual-clutch technology in automatic transmissions, because the dual-clutch behavior in certain situations was sub-optimal. Instead, Mazda chose to re-design the conventional automatic transmission, making the torque converter take less duty while a multi-plate <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages</b> the torque converter most of the time. The new SkyActiv automatic transmission was designed to have six gears forward, one reverse gear, a short torque converter and a clutch integrated with the torque converter.|$|R
5000|$|Starting the 1966 model year, the Simca 1000 was {{available}} with a semi-automatic Ferodo gearbox. In 1966 {{only as the}} 1000 GLA model, but afterwards the semi-automatic gearbox {{was available}} on other models as an option. The gearbox used a torque converter and had four positions: [...] "AR" [...] for reverse gear, [...] "Exceptionnel" [...] for low gear, [...] "Ville Montagne" [...] for city and mountain use and [...] "Route" [...] for open road. The <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged</b> when the selector was touched.|$|R
5000|$|In {{cars with}} manual transmissions, it {{helps keep the}} driver from riding the clutch, a {{dangerous}} practice of keeping the <b>clutch</b> partially <b>disengaged</b> while driving.|$|R
2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both <b>clutches</b> <b>disengage</b> simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|R
50|$|At 117 s, the car slowly accelerates to 50 km/h in 26 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s and 8 s in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears, with {{additional}} 2 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 12 s, decelerates to 35 km/h in 8 s, cruises for another 13 s, brakes {{to a full}} stop in 12 s (manual: 2 s change to the 2nd gear, 7 s in the 2nd gear, last 3 s with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged),</b> then pauses for 7 s (manual: in neutral with clutch engaged).|$|R
50|$|Most torque {{screwdrivers}} {{allow the}} torque {{to be set}} to any value within a range. All have a torque-limiting <b>clutch</b> that <b>disengages</b> once the preset torque has been reached.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rotor drive}} train in {{helicopters}} uses a freewheeling <b>clutch</b> to <b>disengage</b> the rotors {{from the engine}} {{in the event of}} engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by autorotation.|$|R
5000|$|After a 20 s stop - if {{equipped}} with manual gearbox, in the 1st gear with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged</b> - the car slowly accelerates to 70 km/h in 41 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s, 8 s and 13 s in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears, with additional 3 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 50 s (manual: in the 5th gear sic), decelerates to 50 km/h in 8 s (manual: 4 s in the 5th and 4 s in the 4th gear sic) and cruises for 69 s, then slowly accelerates to 70 km/h in 13 s [...]|$|R
50|$|The servo clutch used an {{electric}} switch that supplied manifold vacuum via an actuator valve to a reservoir that <b>disengaged</b> the <b>clutch.</b> The <b>clutch</b> is <b>disengaged</b> automatically whenever the gear-shift lever was touched.|$|R
5000|$|On April 17, 1931, Rossi {{was shot}} and killed in a Cadillac bearing the license plate [...] "2-Z-2950" [...] as it was {{stopped in front of the}} home of Police Captain Lewis J. Valentine at 1650 68th Street in Brooklyn. Witnesses stated three reports, at first taken as engine backfires, were heard and then two men leaped from the rear seat and ran down 68th Street. When found, he was slumped over the {{steering}} wheel with six gunshot wounds, all from the rear. The motor of the car was still running with <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged</b> and one rear door hanging open, indicating the car had come to a stop before the shooting.|$|R
60|$|The solitary man {{who drove}} this curious car was broad and burly. He sat hunched {{up over his}} steering-wheel, with the brim of a Tyrolean hat drawn down over his eyes. The red end of a {{cigarette}} smouldered under the black shadow thrown by the headgear. A dark ulster of some frieze-like material was {{turned up in the}} collar until it covered his ears. His neck was pushed forward from his rounded shoulders, and he seemed, as the car now slid noiselessly down the long sloping road, with the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged</b> and the engine running free, to be peering ahead of him through the darkness in search of some eagerly-expected object.|$|R
50|$|The clutch {{is located}} between {{the engine and}} the gearbox, as {{disengaging}} it is usually required to change gear. Although the gearbox does not stop rotating during a gear change, there is no torque transmitted through it, thus less friction between gears and their engagement dogs. The output shaft of the gearbox is permanently connected to the final drive, then the wheels, and so both always rotate together, at a fixed speed ratio. With the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged,</b> the gearbox input shaft is free to change its speed as the internal ratio is changed. Any resulting difference in speed between the engine and gearbox is evened out as the clutch slips slightly during re-engagement.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of a dual clutch transmission is analogous to two traditional manual transmissions, {{each with its own}} clutch, operating in parallel and alternating shifts. The Ford unit is a six-speed with one clutch acting on first, third and fifth gear, and the other used for second, fourth and sixth gear. As first gear is engaged, the 2-4-6 <b>clutch</b> is <b>disengaged</b> and the second gear cogs are engaged. At the appropriate time, the 1-3-5 <b>clutch</b> is <b>disengaged</b> and the 2-4-6 clutch is engaged. While in second gear, the other side shifts from first to third. The process is repeated with quick smooth shifts and none of the efficiency loss normally associated with torque converters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{new design}} also {{received}} mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes {{than those on}} the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to [...] and produced [...] Options included a freewheeling <b>clutch</b> to <b>disengage</b> the driveline, {{as well as a}} selective-control automatic clutch.|$|R
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} with a manual transmission, riding the clutch {{refers to the}} {{practice}} of needlessly keeping the <b>clutch</b> partially <b>disengaged.</b> This results in the clutch being unable to fully engage with the flywheel and so causes premature wear on the disc and flywheel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new design}} also {{received}} mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes {{than those on}} the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to 254 CID L and produced [...] Options included a freewheeling <b>clutch</b> to <b>disengage</b> the driveline, {{as well as a}} selective-control automatic clutch.|$|R
50|$|An early {{version of}} this type of {{transmission}} was the Autostick, which was used in the Volkswagen Beetle and Karmann Ghia from 1967 to 1976, where the <b>clutch</b> was <b>disengaged</b> by servo when the driver pushed downward slightly on the gear shift lever. This was a 3-speed unit.|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the <b>clutch</b> is <b>disengaged,</b> the input shaft, clutch disk and countershaft can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the input shaft and clutch, and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|R
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages,</b> turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} is cool or even at normal {{operating}} temperature, the fan <b>clutch</b> partially <b>disengages</b> the engine's mechanically driven radiator cooling fan, generally located {{at the front of}} the water pump and driven by a belt and pulley connected to the engine's crankshaft. This saves power, since the engine does not have to fully drive the fan.|$|R
25|$|Archers {{powerplant}} {{continued to}} give trouble, particularly the electro-magnetic clutches. If the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged</b> the engines would race at high revs {{and had to}} be shut down in order for repairs to be made. This was particularly problematic if aircraft were flying or there were enemy submarines nearby. On 26 June, Archer departed Freetown bound for Bermuda, where she was to undergo repairs. Work started on 15 July and took some fourteen weeks to complete. Archer then sailed to New York City where she joined Convoy UGS 2 which departed New York on 2 November bound for Casablanca, Morocco. She ferried 30 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and US personnel to Casablanca. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join convoy MKF 3 which departed Gibraltar on 27 November. When Archer arrived in the UK, she was sent to Liverpool for another refit which commenced on 4 December. Her flight deck was lengthened at this refit.|$|R
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning <b>clutch</b> <b>disengages.</b>|$|R
