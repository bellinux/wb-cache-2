While she was there, {{one of her}} father's six wives, Ma Sedia, seriously injured Fatima's hands for a misdemeanor. This caused her {{considerable}} pain throughout her childhood, hampering her ability to play the violin. She later became a highly competent player, though she remained self-conscious about the scarring <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult.

25|$|While Dutt {{was hired}} by Prabhat Film Company as a choreographer, he was pressed into service as an actor, and <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{assistant}} director. After Prabhat failed in 1947, Dutt moved to Bombay, where he worked with two leading directors of the time, with Amiya Chakravarty in Girls' School, and with Gyan Mukherjee in the Bombay Talkies film Sangram. Then, Dev Anand offered him {{a job as a}} director in his new company, Navketan, after the first movie had flopped.|$|E
25|$|Living {{within an}} {{autonomous}} shelter may also require that party {{to make sacrifices}} with lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations to name a few. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require some alterations upon the residents psychological behavior(s); while others may adjust easily, others may not. Others describe their experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually {{at the expense of}} reduced autonomy.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} seasons at United, Ronaldo played {{an even more}} attacking and central role, {{functioning}} both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks, though his ability in this regard deteriorated later on in his career.|$|E

Auxilia contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, light infantry or velites, and labourers. There was also a reconnaissance squad of 10 or more light mounted infantry called speculatores who could also serve as messengers or <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early form of military intelligence service.|$|E
25|$|The Fifth Dalai Lama's Regent or Desi, Sonam Rapten was, in fact, a fanatical Gelugpa {{supremacist}} {{as well as}} {{a shrewd}} and canny political operator with an eye for the main chance. Being 22 years the Dalai Lama's senior he dominated him as he raised him from the age of 5.

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Allen T. Gilliland in 1960, {{ownership}} of KNTV was held by the executors of his estate, which included son Allen T. Gilliland Jr. The younger Gilliland acquired majority ownership in August 1966 and later operated {{it as part of}} Gill Industries, which also controlled San Jose's cable television system. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ABC affiliate, KNTV occasionally preempted a few ABC programs. KGO-TV, meanwhile, aired ABC's entire programming schedule, so this often gave San Jose and Silicon Valley area residents a second choice for viewing preempted ABC programming. Gill Industries sold KNTV to Norfolk-based Landmark Communications in 1978. Twelve years later, Landmark sold the station to a minority-owned firm, Granite Broadcasting.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, {{historians and}} public bodies {{had begun to}} realise the loss to the nation of this destruction. However, {{the process of change}} was long, and it was not until 1984 with the {{preservation}} of Calke Abbey that it became obvious that opinion had changed. In the 21st century, the period of change seems cemented. A large public appeal has assured the preservation of Tyntesfield in 2002, and in 2007, Dumfries House and its collection were saved, after protracted appeals and debates. Today, demolition has ceased to be a realistic, or legal, option for listed buildings, and an historic house (particularly one with its contents intact) has become recognized as worthy of retention and preservation. However, many country houses are still at risk and their security, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> entirety with their contents, is not guaranteed by any legislation.|$|E
25|$|A former left-back, Muntari later {{developed}} into a powerful, experienced, hard-working, and tenacious midfielder; although he is primarily known for his physical strength and combative playing style, he was also able to make notable improvements to his technical skills throughout his career. He also possesses a good left-foot, a powerful shot from outside the area, and is a solid passer of the ball. He primarily excels as a ball-winner, due to his energy, tactical intelligence, and ability {{to break down the}} opposition's play; a versatile footballer, although he is usually deployed as a defensive, central, or box-to-box midfielder, he is also capable of playing as a left winger or <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attacking midfielder. Due to his aggressive and hard-tackling style of play, however, he has also been criticised for his tendency to pick up cards.|$|E

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} is a mother's {{ability to}} perceive and infer the meaning behind her infant's behavioural signals, {{and to respond}} to them promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, {{all the way to}} adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal sensitivity has been found to affect the person psychologically <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult. Adults who experienced high maternal sensitivity during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal sensitivity will affect their own children's development. Some research suggests that adult mothers display more maternal sensitivity than adolescent mothers who may in turn have children with a lower IQ and reading level than children of adult mothers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{adolescent}} {{he realized}} that his real destiny was music. But {{at the insistence of}} his mother, he first went to college, to study philosophy and later lawâhis father, who had died when Joseph was only seven, had been a lawyer. While at university, however, he continued his musical activities, including composition, although he had had only a few lessons in harmony. Eventually he persuaded his mother to let him show some of his compositions to Edgar Tinel, at the time one of Belgiumâs most esteemed musicians. Tinel had never taken on private students (nor would he ever again), âbut,â he wrote, âI let myself be conquered because this young man will one day be someone. He played me a sonata of his. I was stupified. He already is someone, but he has never studied. This fellow has written sonatas, trios, variations, duos â¦â His mother relented, and from 1891 to 1895 Joseph studied with Tinel.|$|E
25|$|Eto'o is a fast, strong, and {{energetic}} forward, {{who is known}} for his stamina, work-rate, ability in the air, and his accurate finishing ability both with his head and feet. A powerful and prolific goalscorer with good technique, composure in front of goal, and an ability to play off other forwards, Eto'o is primarily deployed as a central striker, although during his time at Inter, under JosÃ© Mourinho, he demonstrated notable tactical intelligence and versatility by playing in several other positions on the pitch. During Inter's 2009â10 treble-winning season, Eto'o {{played an important role in}} the squad, and was utilised as a winger or <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attacking midfielder in Mourinho's 4â2â3â1 formation, where he was primarily required to help his team creatively and defensively with his work-rate off the ball. During the return leg of the Champions League semi-final match against Barcelona, Eto'o demonstrated his workrate and versatility by playing as an attacking full-back following Thiago Motta's controversial sending-off. Eto'o has also been renowned for his leadership, opportunism and mentality throughout his career. In his prime, Eto'o was regarded by pundits as one of the best strikers in the world; he is currently regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time. Despite losing some of his speed with age, he continued to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate as a striker, due to his ability to get into good positions and time his attacking runs, as shown by his goal in a 6â3 loss against Chelsea on 30 August 2014, during his time with Everton. Despite his advancing age, Eto'o has maintained his dribbling skills in his later career, which he uses to his advantage to beat defenders and assist teammates.|$|E
