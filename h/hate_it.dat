500|$|In {{the first}} edition of The Hobbit, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.

[...] And Pony {{said he was}} not afraid; for {{if there}} was {{anything}} that a Boy's Town boy <b>hated,</b> <b>it</b> was to be afraid, and Pony <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> the worst of any, because he was sometimes afraid that he was afraid.|$|R

I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E

The Washington Post and the New York Daily News criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness– the word [...] "fuck" [...] is used 857times in the film. In his 2009 book , law professor Christopher M. Fairman called the movie [...] "the most important film using 'fuck'". The American Film Institute said, [...] "Ultimately, Fuck is a movie about free speech... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend.

500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub-bass and more with mid-range sounds such as Caspa, Rusko, and Vex'd. Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that [...] "brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> in a way... It's like someone screaming in your face... you don't want that." [...] According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs, the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a [...] "Jamaican inheritance" [...] and distance it from the [...] "belching, aggressive, resolutely macho" [...] dubstep produced by his contemporaries.|$|E

Milking the cows is spoken of in the traditional fashion as a lovely pastoral recreation, when {{as a matter of fact}} it is a tedious job. We all <b>hated</b> <b>it.</b> We saw no poetry in <b>it.</b> We <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> in summer when the mosquitoes bit and the cows slashed us with their tails, and we <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> still more in the winter time when they stood in crowded malodorous stalls.|$|R

500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|For {{its second}} album, Pearl Jam felt the {{pressures}} of trying to match the success of its debut album, Ten. In a 2002 interview, guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Vs. was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by producer Brendan O'Brien. It was also the band's first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album Ten. Rehearsals for Vs. began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in Seattle, Washington. The band then moved to The Site in Nicasio, California in March 1993 to begin recording.

How do you make a rock record here?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he {{was initially}} skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. [...] "It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... I just <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
