5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E

40|$|This study compares final {{sentencing}} decisions {{ordered by}} judges to {{federal and state}} sentencing guidelines for protective order violations. The authors reviewed violations that were pled before the largest district court in Utah and found that {{in the majority of}} cases, <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not sentenced in accordance with federal and state guidelines. Although state guidelines mandate defendants who violate a protective order to attend a batterer intervention program, less than one fourth of <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to attend such programs. Fewer than half of the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> arrested and incarcerated, as opposed to the 100 % mandated by state sentencing guidelines. Federal guidelines mandate that all <b>defendants</b> <b>be</b> ordered to surrender firearms, but only six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> given that order.

25|$|In general, if a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found incompetent {{to proceed}} to trial, the {{criminal}} proceedings are suspended.

25|$|Drug {{sentencing}} guidelines {{under state law}} in America are generally much less harsh than the federal {{sentencing guidelines}}, although great irregularities exist. The vast majority of drug felonies and almost all drug misdemeanors in the United States are prosecuted at the state level. The federal government tends to prosecute only drug trafficking cases involving large amounts of drugs, or cases which have been referred to federal prosecutors by local district attorneys seeking the harsher sentences provided under the federal sentencing guidelines. In rare instances, some <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant does not face double jeopardy if he is convicted and sentenced by {{both the state and}} federal government for the same underlying criminal conduct.|$|E
25|$|Three {{programmes}} {{of legal}} assistance, jointly {{administered by the}} Law Society and Bar Association of Hong Kong, are subvented by the Government. The Duty Lawyer Scheme rosters barristers and solicitors in private practice {{to appear in the}} Magistrates and Juvenile Courts on a remunerated basis. The scheme provides representation to all juveniles (defendants under 16) and to most adult defendants charged in the Magistrates’ Courts who cannot afford private representation. The <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> required to pay a handling charge of $300 upon granting of Duty Lawyer representation. In 2002, 45 162 defendants were assisted. The Legal Advice Scheme, staffed by over 840 volunteer lawyers, operates 10 sessions per week at nine evening centres. In 2002, 6 084 cases were handled. The scheme is not means tested. A free Tel-Law Service offers trilingual (Cantonese, Putonghua and English) taped information on 73 topics. Eight telephone lines operate 24 hours. In 2002, 51 058 calls were received.|$|E
25|$|The Alford plea arose {{out of the}} 1970 {{case before}} the Supreme Court of the United States, North Carolina v. Alford, where the Court ruled that the {{defendant}} could be allowed to enter a guilty plea while still maintaining innocence. According to the United States Department of Justice, in 2000 {{a greater percentage of}} State inmates made use of the plea than Federal inmates. The state courts of Indiana, Michigan, and New Jersey do not allow usage of the plea. It has been used in other states, and in application of the plea process the courts require the plea to be of a voluntary nature and based on factual evidence. The courts make an effort to determine <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> entering the plea by their own choice, {{and that there is a}} factual basis for the plea; they accomplish this by questioning the defendant about their choice and the prosecution about the potential case against the defendant. Once entered, the plea is treated as a standard guilty plea.|$|E
2500|$|The case {{then went}} to the Exchequer of Pleas, where it was heard between 3 and 5 May 1865. It was heard on two points. Firstly, whether the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for the actions of the {{contractors}} and secondly, whether the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for the damage regardless of their lack of negligence. They decided for the first point that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, but more split on the second point. Pollock CB, Martin B and Channell B held that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, as since a negligence claim could not be brought there was no valid case. Bramwell B, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. He stated that [...] "the general law in matters wholly independent of contract" [...] should <b>be</b> that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable, [...] "on the plain ground that the defendants have caused water to flow into the 's mines, which but for the defendant's act would not have gone there".|$|R
50|$|Additionally, some jurisdictions add the {{question}} of whether or not the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> in control of their behavior at the time of the offense. For example, if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> compelled by some aspect of their mental illness to commit the illegal act, the <b>defendant</b> could <b>be</b> evaluated as not in control of their behavior at the time of the offense.|$|R

25|$|Trials are public, and {{defendants}} {{have the}} right to legal counsel and to call defense witnesses in the federal and some provincial courts that have an accusatory system of criminal justice. If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when defendants face serious criminal charges. During the investigative stage, defendants can submit questions in writing to the investigating judge. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments in criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions. Although the 1994 constitution provides for trial by jury, implementing legislation had not been passed by year's end. In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of certain serious crimes {{have the right}} to a trial by jury. Lengthy delays in trials are a nationwide problem, with many cases taking five or more years to resolve. <b>Defendants</b> <b>are</b> presumed innocent and {{have the right to}} appeal, as do prosecutors. Minors under age 16 cannot be criminally prosecuted. By law defendants and attorneys have access to government held evidence, but they may experience significant obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence. In 2008, the human rights organization Fundacion Sur noted that the country lacked a separate juvenile justice system that affords adolescents due process protections and the right to a legal defense in criminal cases and expressed concern that the broad discretion judges have in such cases increased the possibility of arbitrary rulings. The age of legal liability is 16, and Fundacion Sur asserted that 16- and 17-year-old offenders frequently were transferred to adult criminal courts or held in juvenile detention centers for longer periods than warranted by their offenses. A December 2008 Supreme Court decision found that the country's juvenile justice system did not comply with international conventions and highlighted the need for the legislative branch to remedy the situation.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose, {{that the}} {{proposition}} {{to be proven}} <b>is</b> that <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> {{the source of a}} hair found at the crime scene. Before learning that the hair was a genetic match for the defendant’s hair, the factfinder believes that the odds are 2 to 1 that the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source of the hair. If she used Bayes’ theorem, she could multiply those prior odds by a “likelihood ratio” in order to update her odds after learning that the hair matched the defendant’s hair.
