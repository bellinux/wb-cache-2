It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Studies in Europe and North America {{have shown}} {{dramatic}} declines in bee colonies. The U.S. has lost 59% of its bee colonies since 1947, and Europe has lost over 25% since 1985.

5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E

5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers {{have a negative}} mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance is an {{open-ended}} 4X real-time strategy (RTS) game from Gremlin Interactive, released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. Diplomacy <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> {{the success or failure of}} this franchise operation as the players colonies begin to encroach on one another.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E
