Aitken feels that [...] "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues.

500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

Rather, the element in Chardonnay that Champagne wine-makers look <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> finesse and balance of acidity that it brings to the blend.

2500|$|Jeremiah Gurney (1812–1895) {{was born}} in Coeymans, New York. Gurney, then a jeweler in Saratoga, N.Y. {{became one of the}} first, if not the first student in America to learn the [...] "new art" [...] of daguerreian photography. Gurney was taught the process by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1839, who {{explained}} to Gurney that [...] "What you will have to allow <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> initial outlay [...] [...] And there is of course my fee." [...] The fee was thought to have been fifty dollars. Gurney was not listed in the New York city directories until 1843, when he appears as a daguerreian at 189 Broadway. In the 1850s [...] "Gurney's Daguerreian Gallery" [...] offered mammoth daguerreotype prints from double full size plates. In 1852, he took time off to recover from a common illness of the daguerreian trade, mercury vapor poisoning. In 1857 Gurney was listed in the New York City Directory at 359 Broadway, in partnership with C.D Fredericks. In 1860, he was listed as a [...] "photographist" [...] at 707 Broadway, in business as [...] "J. Gurney and Son." [...] Gurney and son Benjamin advanced paper photography {{with the use of the}} [...] "Chrystalotype" [...] process. Jeremiah Gurney is probably best known for his having taken a photograph of Abraham Lincoln in an open coffin April 24, 1865, as the President's body lay in state in City Hall, New York City. The episode caused much distress to Mary Lincoln, who had forbid the taking of any photographs of her husband's corpse. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was furious and succeeded in confiscating all of the existing prints and negatives but one. In 1874 Gurney's partnership with his son was dissolved. In April 1895, Jeremiah Gurney began a journal that was later gifted to the New York Historical Society by the photographer's great-great grandniece, Miss Elizabeth May Possons.|$|E
