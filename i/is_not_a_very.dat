5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E

The line was closed {{during one of the}} rail reformations as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{profitable}} line, probably due to the more direct Adelaide–Mannum Road. The track is now long gone but the earthworks can still be seen along the edges of the Birdwood flat to Mount Torrens and towards Mount Pleasant. Also still standing is an old stone railway bridge near Mount Torrens. The line closed in 1953.|$|R

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> specialized feeder however, and has also been recorded from plants of other families, such as Asteraceae or Caryocaraceae. It utilizes flowers of native {{as well as those of}} some introduced ornamental plants. It will also take insects caught by hawking. In south-eastern Brazil where it is plentiful even in urban parks and gardens, it is commonly attracted to hummingbird feeders.|$|E

25|$|Arterial damage {{results from}} {{white blood cell}} {{invasion}} and inflammation within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, {{so it can be}} used as a very rough proxy for heart disease risk. Since many things can cause elevated CRP, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> specific prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, a level above 2.4mg/L has been associated with a doubled risk of a coronary event compared to levels below 1mg/L; however, the study group in this case consisted of patients who had been diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris; whether elevated CRP has any predictive value of acute coronary events in the general population of all age ranges remains unclear. Currently, C-reactive protein is not recommended as a cardiovascular disease screening test for average-risk adults without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A very {{favorite}} {{style of}} chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a {{surface in the}} Cook Islands, the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement {{in the middle of}} the article or at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The Fiji Islanders, employ chip designs rivaling those of Europe in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal Marquesas carver appreciates the way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The Ijos of the lower Niger design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo does good work of this kind.|$|E

500|$|Fuming has an {{advantage}} over staining in {{that it does not}} obscure the grain, it just darkens it. [...] Unlike staining, there is no possibility of blotches or runs. [...] Fuming is also colourfast. [...] Fuming has the disadvantage that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> precise process. [...] Different batches of wood will react to fuming differently. [...] For this reason wood that is to be fumed for a particular project is often taken from the same tree. [...] Even so, boards from the same tree, and even different regions of the same board, can have a noticeably different colour. [...] Where a consistent colour is important, staining or dyeing may be better options.|$|E

500|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} as to why this specific subject [...] not a very common theme in art history [...] was chosen. One suggestion sees the painting as a justification for the so-called catasto of 1427; {{a new form of}} income tax. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> likely explanation, however, as Brancacci would stand to lose from the new taxation, and would probably rather have been among its opponents. A more probable explanation links the painting to Pope Martin V's 1423 agreement that the Florentine church be subjected to state tax. The money found in the fish's mouth can also be seen as an expression of how Florence's wealth came from the sea. Felice Brancacci, a silk merchant involved in Mediterranean trade, was {{also a member of the}} city's Board of Maritime Consuls.|$|E
500|$|The Vixen {{experimental}} tests used TNT {{to blow up}} simulated {{nuclear warheads}} containing plutonium-239. In total, Vixen B scattered 22.2kg of plutonium around the Maralinga test site known as Taranaki, in particles of widely divergent size. Plutonium is not particularly dangerous externally - it emits alpha particles which are stopped by [...] of air, or the dead layer of skin cells on the body, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> intensive source of radiation, due to its long half-life of 24,000 years. It is most dangerous when it enters the body, in the worst case by breathing, and therefore tiny particles, often the result of such explosion testing, are the worst threat. [...] The extreme biological persistence of plutonium's radioactive contamination and the cancer threat posed by alpha radiation occurring internally together establish plutonium's dangers.|$|E
500|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Byzantine text-type, but with a number of singular readings. According to Bruce M. Metzger it is typical Byzantine text.

It does not support the [...] "original" [...] text against the Byzantine. It has 11 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category V of New Testament manuscripts.
