40|$|Development of a Braided Polypropylene Rope Using Polypropylene <b>Tape</b> <b>Yarns</b> is {{a journal}} article. Traditionally, braided ropes are {{manufactured}} using either staple yarns or multifilament yarns. This study therefore sought {{to break this}} traditional paradigm by uniquely and economically manufacturing braided polypropylene ropes using polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarns.</b> A recipe made up of virgin polypropylene granules, calcium carbonate and black masterbatch was used to produce a polypropylene plastic sheet, which was extruded on a Barmag machine. <b>Tape</b> <b>yarns</b> with a width of 22 mm on average were produced. Count, width, thickness, elongation and tensile strength of the <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> used to produce the rope were tested. The elongation and tensile strength tests were done on a Micro 500 Testometric strength-testing machine. Test results on the <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> revealed that they have properties that fall within the standard range of <b>fibrillated</b> polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarns.</b> Sorptive properties of both the <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> used and the braided rope developed revealed {{a slight increase in}} water absorbance to approximately 0. 15 % compared to standard water absorbance of less than 0. 1 %. This increment in water absorbance, however, did not change the floating properties of both the <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> and the braided rope as they both remained with their positive buoyancy. Also, no signs of microbial attack were seen on the <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> and the braided rope by naked eyes after exposing the samples to water. The resultant braided rope produced was made up of 12 X 4973 denier polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarns</b> with a 9200 -denier polypropylene bailer twine as the core. The count and diameter of the resultant rope were found to be close to those of hazard barrier and hydro-pulling ropes and were also analogous to those of 5 mm cotton braided ropes produced...|$|R

Rather, they are ribbons made especially for knitting or crocheting, with some in a tubular form, some woven flat, and some similar in appearance to Bias <b>tape.</b> Ribbon <b>yarns</b> can be composed of many materials, from synthetics to silk to plant fibers.|$|R
30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and {{combination}} yarn. First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a <b>tape</b> <b>yarn,</b> and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> through a twisting machine. In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a twisting machine (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining paper yarn and core spun yarn. In this study, Hanji paper yarn of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the core spun yarn [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C. With this process, the count of Hanji combination yarn produced was 10 and 15  Ne, respectively.|$|R
40|$|PP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{synthetic}} textiles. It is a synthetic polymer for the production of textile products. It is widely used because of its cheap production expenditures, universal utilization, easy recycling, and good mechanical features. In addition, polypropylene is flexible and firm, but in a low temperature it can become very fragile. Polypropylene is not resistant to aging – features deteriorate, it decomposes from light exposure, dampness, and warmth. 	PP materials are commonly used in various spheres: agriculture, chemistry, food industry, manufacturing, and others that may require firm and reliable packaging; initial and secondary carpet production, secondary fabrics, geotextile, cable and rope production. Thanks to their durability, light weight and usage simplicity, they are popularly used for pre-packing and transporting such goods as: flour, sugar, composite forage, grains and seeds, fertilizer, manufacturing materials, wood granules, second-hand clothes, cement. 	Three different drawing ratio (A- 6, 002, B- 6, 502, and C- 6, 869) polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> were used for the research. In the centre of the analysis is <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> drawing ratios influence on their structure and stretch characteristics. The width, thickness and weight of PP <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> was measured, additionally, the statistical calculations were made: calculation of mean, absolute error, relative error, and variation coefficient. The stretch test was carried out until the absolute yarn breakage. Experimental results were analyzed in detail. After the analysis of PP <b>tape</b> <b>yarn,</b> it was concluded, that the yarn and product weight, as well as the strength features, were dependant on the drawing ratio. 	The features of textile products that were made from polypropylene (affected by mechanical forces and environmental factors) get worse, the elasticity contracts, the level of fragility and breakage rises, rigidity appears. Because of these factors, products tend to lose firmness, and there is a higher chance of cracking and tearing. 	To achieve precision, three different drawing ratios were used for the polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> strength feature test. Tests showed that on the lowest drawing ration (A- 6, 002), polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarn</b> is the thickest, widest, heaviest, and has the biggest height density, but from the perspective of consumption, it is a big flaw. The conducted conclusion is that for consumption purposes it is best to use the biggest drawing ratio yarn (C- 6, 869). 	The achieved results are important from the scientific and economical perspective: we can predict the economically significant indicators, and reach an objective that the usage of products made out of polypropylene yarn would be even more diverse, and the mean of production- more economical...|$|R
50|$|Some {{studies were}} {{performed}} using waste carpet fibers in concrete as an environmentally friendly use of recycled carpet waste. A carpet typically {{consists of two}} layers of backing (usually fabric from polypropylene <b>tape</b> <b>yarns),</b> joined by CaCO3 filled styrene-butadiene latex rubber (SBR), and face fibers (majority being nylon 6 and nylon 66 textured yarns). Such nylon and polypropylene fibers {{can be used for}} concrete reinforcement. Other ideas are emerging to use recycled materials as fibers: recycled Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber, for example.|$|R

30|$|The {{uncoiled}} yarn {{was prepared}} by twisting four-, eight-, and twelve-layer MWCNT sheets with width {{and length of}} ~ 0.8 and 7.5  cm, respectively, in ethanol solution. A relatively low-inserted twist of about ~ 2, 084 turns per meter was needed to induce high porosity and infiltration of paraffin during dipping. After twist insertion, {{both ends of the}} uncoiled yarn were fixed to a glass slide using carbon <b>tape.</b> The <b>yarn,</b> with both ends fixed, was dipped in melted paraffin for 10  s, and more twist was provided until the coiled structure was formed. A constant load of ~ 5  mN was applied to the paraffin-infiltrated MWCNT yarn when additional twist was provided.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{multiple}} commercial vendors {{have developed}} capability {{for the production}} of large-scale quantities of high-quality carbon nanotube sheets and yarns. While the materials have found use in electrical shielding applications, development of structural systems composed of a high volume fraction of carbon nanotubes is still lacking. A recent NASA program seeks to address this by prototyping a structural nanotube composite with strength-toweight ratio exceeding current state-of-the-art carbon fiber composites. Commercially available carbon nanotube sheets, <b>tapes,</b> and <b>yarns</b> are being processed into high volume fraction carbon nanotube-polymer nanocomposites. Nondestructive evaluation techniques have been applied throughout this development effort for material characterization and process control. This paper will report on the progress of these efforts, including magnetic characterization of residual catalyst content, Raman scattering characterization of nanotube diameter, defect ratio, and nanotube strain, and polarized Raman scattering for characterization of nanotube alignment...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) based materials promise {{advances in}} the production of high strength and multifunctional components for aerospace and other applications. Specifically, in tension dominated applications, the latest CNT based filaments are yielding composite properties comparable to or exceeding composites from more established fibers such as Kevlar and carbon fiber. However, for the properties of these materials to be fully realized at the component level, suitable manufacturing processes have to be developed. These materials handle differently from conventional fibers, with different wetting characteristics and behavior under load. The limited availability of bulk forms also requires that the equipment be scaled down accordingly to tailor the process development approach to material availability. Here, the development of hardware and software for filament winding of carbon nanotube based <b>tapes</b> and <b>yarns</b> is described. This hardware features precision guidance of the CNT material and control of the winding tension over a wide range in an open architecture that allows for effective process control and troubleshooting during winding. Use of the filament winder to develop CNT based Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) shall also be discussed...|$|R

She works often with quotidian materials such as paper, <b>yarn,</b> <b>tape,</b> and chalk interspersed with culturally charged materials such as cocoa butter, coffee, corn husks, and her body. Themes present in her work include memory, ritual, culture, and adornment. She is interested in chronicling, researching, and the systematic arrangement of objects. Her work gives form to patterns both natural and constructed, while creating tension and movement within space. These themes stem from an attraction to site-specificity and investigation of material and spatial properties. Much of her work deals with gestures of navigation and structures of memory.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are one-dimensional nanomaterials with outstanding {{electrical and}} thermal conductivities and mechanical properties. This combination of properties offers routes to enable lightweight structural aerospace components. Recent {{advances in the}} manufacturing of CNTs have made bulk forms such as <b>yarns,</b> <b>tapes</b> and sheets available in commercial quantities to permit the evaluation of these materials for aerospace use, where the superior tensile properties of CNT composites can be exploited in tension dominated applications such as composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs). To investigate their utility in this application, aluminum rings were overwrapped with thermoset/CNT yarn composite and their mechanical properties measured. CNT composite overwrap characteristics such as processing method, CNT/resin ratio, and applied tension during CNT yarn winding were varied to determine their effects on the mechanical performance of the CNT composite overwrapped Al rings (CCOARs). Mechanical properties of the CCOARs were measured under static and cyclic loads at room, elevated, and cryogenic temperatures to evaluate their mechanical performance relative to bare Al rings. At room temperature, the breaking load of CCOARs with a 10. 8 % additional weight due to the CNT yarn/thermoset overwrap increased by over 200 % compared to the bare Al ring. The quality of the wound CNT composites was also investigated using x-ray computed tomography...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} glass fiber reinforced Polyamide (PA 6) composites made by prepreg <b>tapes</b> and commingled <b>yarns</b> were studied by in-plane compression, short-beam shear, and flexural tests. The composites were fabricated with different fiber volume contents (prepregs— 47 %, 55 %, 60 %, and commingled— 48 %, 48 %, 49 %, respectively) by using vacuum consolidation technique. To evaluate laminate quality in terms of fiber wet-out at filament level, homogeneity of fiber/matrix distribution, and matrix/fiber bonding standard microscopic methods like optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. Both commingled and prepreg glass fiber/PA 6 composites (with Vf ? 48 %) give {{mechanical properties}} such as compression strength (530 – 570 MPa), inter-laminar shear strength (70 – 80 MPa), and transverse strength (80 – 90 MPa). By increasing small percentage in the fiber content show significant rise in compression strength, slight decrease in the ILSS and transverse strengths, whereas semipreg give very poor properties with the slight increase in fiber content. Overall comparison of mechanical properties indicates commingled glass fiber/PA 6 composite shows much better performance compared with prepregs due to uniform distribution of fiber and matrix, better melt-impregnation while processing, perfect alignment of glass fibers in the composite. This study proves again {{that the presence of}} voids and poor interface bonding between matrix/fiber leads to decrease in the mechanical properties.
