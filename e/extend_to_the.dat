5|$|Napkin {{psoriasis}} is a subtype of psoriasis {{common in}} infants characterized by red papules with silver {{scale in the}} diaper area that may <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torso or limbs. Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis (diaper rash).|$|E
5|$|Dnieper delta: This {{small area}} of {{distribution}} in southern Ukraine {{was reported in}} 2005. It is now isolated by steppe from the Danube basin, {{but it has been}} suggested that these areas were connected through marshlands during the last glacial maximum, when the level of the Black Sea was around 100 metres lower than today. This range may also <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower basins of the Dniester and Bug rivers.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Otherside Entertainment, a new {{developer}} {{founded by}} Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans, {{announced a new}} entry in the series, entitled Underworld Ascendant. The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss, but this licensing agreement does not <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ultima name or greater IP, effectively orphaning Underworld from the Ultima series.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{includes}} {{a number of}} miscellaneous points, mainly in Sections 5 and 6. The Act and its provisions are taken to <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Crown, which can be held tortiously liable to the extent {{laid out in the}} Crown Proceedings Act 1947. It repeals Section 4 of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, replacing it with Section 4 of this Act, and unlike the 1957 Act does not allow any provisions or duties to be excluded or restricted.|$|E

5|$|Transport {{is one of}} {{the four}} main areas of policy {{administered}} by the Mayor of London, however the mayor's financial control does not <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TFL).|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{planning}} {{continued for}} the construction of the route, as well as modifications to the existing roadway. The City of La Mesa began discussions regarding adding SR 125 from SR 94 to I-8 into the scenic highway system in 1968; the county Planning Commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970. SR 125 was lengthened by the Legislature to <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican border in 1972. In 1973, then-governor Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to delete part of SR 125 from state plans, over concerns that not enough transportation studies had been done on the matter. An improved interchange with SR94 was being planned the next year. Soon after, Caltrans raised concerns about the remainder of SR 125 not being constructed, due to objections from the community relating to freeway construction in general.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sides of the braincase.|$|E

5|$|Larger scale state-generating {{processes}} {{developed in}} Slavic {{areas in the}} 9th century. Great Moravia, the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now Moravia and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do not <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia {{took place during the}} reign of Svatopluk I {{at the end of the}} 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.|$|E
5|$|Legacy Parkway {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Legacy Highway project first {{proposed}} by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island or across Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west side of the Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley Research for The Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed too many times for that to occur.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{leaders of}} the Kilab {{continued}} to hold the title of amir al-ʿarab after the Ayyubid conquest of Aleppo in 1182. As a result, Haditha's jurisdiction initially did not <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aleppo region (northern Syria). However, during {{the latter half of}} az-Zahir Ghazi (r. 1193–1216) of Aleppo's reign, the Kilab were brought under Haditha's authority and were stripped of the amir al-ʿarab title. According to medieval Arab historian Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262), the Kilab's status was downgraded because of the growing power of the Tayy clans, while al-Hamdani asserts that the numerically-superior Kilab were weakened by a divided leadership. Following the extension of Haditha's jurisdiction to their traditional territory, some of the Kilab migrated north to Anatolia, while those who remained became allies of Haditha's Al Fadl clan.|$|E

5|$|St Columba was {{probably}} a disciple of Finnian. He left Ireland after being exiled, and founded the monastery at Iona off {{the west coast of}} Scotland in 563, probably on land granted from a Christian king. From there missions were carried out to western Argyll and the islands around Mull. Later the influence of Iona would <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides. Iona emerged as the most important religious centre in the north of Britain, {{partly as a result of}} the work of Adomnan, who was abbot there from 679 to 704. Although it is unclear whether the historic Columba did conduct missions outside of a small part of Dál Riata, Adoman's Life of St. Columba elevated him to become the apostle of North Britain in general.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to <b>extend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon {{learning of the}} tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E
