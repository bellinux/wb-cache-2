5000|$|Punie's {{companion}} from Waku-Waku Mascot Village, Paya-tan is a dog-like {{creature with}} a single horn, and two distinct personalities. He became Punie's mascot after she defeated him in unarmed combat with her Princess Head Lock, although not before warning Punie that he will grab any opportunity to make attempts on her life, which she confidently agreed. While assisting Punie, he behaves cutely and speaks in a high-pitched voice. At other times, he attempts to assassinate Punie and behaves in a more adult fashion, speaking in a deep voice and smoking a cigarette. Paya-tan served as an army colonel during the Vietnam War and {{it has also been}} implied that he had fought in Russia as well. He also is extremely <b>flexibe</b> and can rotate his arms and legs in a 360 motion.|$|E
40|$|Time {{intervals}} like ‘tonight’, {{which are}} usually not very precise, can be modeled as fuzzy sets. But this causes the problem that the relations between points and intervals and between two intervals, {{which are usually}} very trivial, become very complex when the intervals are fuzzy sets. Moreover, {{there are many different}} possibilities to define such relations. In this paper I propose a very <b>flexibe</b> operator-based approach to point–interval and interval-interval relations, where the intervals are fuzzy time intervals over the real numbers. The relations yield non-trivial fuzzy values even if the intervals are crisp...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a groundbraking methodology for the radar international community. The detection approach introduced, namely perturbation analysis, is completey novel showing a remarkable capability of thinking outside the box. Perturbation analysis {{is able to}} push forward the performance limits of current algorithms, allowing the detection of targets smaller than the resolution cell and highly embedded in clutter. The methodology itself is extraordinary <b>flexibe</b> and has already been used in two other large projects, funded by the ESA (European Space Agency) : M-POL for maritime surveillance, and DRAGON- 2 for land classification with particular attention to forests. This book is a perfectly organised piece of work where every detail and perspective is {{taken into account in}} order to provide a comprehensive vision of the problems and solutions...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 5 of the Learning Design book {{describes}} the operational {{model of a}} learning design engine based {{on the concept of}} finite automata with output alphabet. We rely on this event concept to include pre-existing learning tools in <b>flexibe</b> and rich learning designs. Contribution: We sketch an approach for the integration of complex learning environments in learning designs. Interactive learning support environments, such as argumentation or modelling tools are pre-existent and have a high potential when integrated in learning designs. We propose an approach that aims at a clear separation of the learning design engine, the specification of the learning flow (as LD documents) and learning environments. According to its current state, the engine controls the learning environment with events (such as &quot;start a new phase&quot;), defined as a vocabulary for a set of environments, that are mapped to the environments ' existing functionality (such as &quot;create new workspace&quot;). Thus the engine remotely controls the learning tools while the tools can initiate state transitions in the engine on specific events in the tool...|$|E
