25|$|May {{has used}} Vox AC30 {{amplifiers}} almost exclusively since {{a meeting with}} his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s/early 1970s. In the mid-1970s he used six of them, with an <b>Echoplex</b> delay (with extended delay time) plugged into a separate amplifier, and a second <b>Echoplex</b> plugged into yet another amp; he used a homemade booster, his only effects pedal, which was on all the time. His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was <b>echoplexed</b> to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|The band Fotomaker {{was formed}} in 1977 by bassist Gene Cornish and drummer Dino Danelli, {{former members of the}} Rock n Roll HALL of FAME 1960s group The Rascals (a/k/a [...] "The Young Rascals"). Rounding out the group was world renowned guitarist/vocalist Wally Bryson, {{formerly}} of power-pop hitmakers Raspberries (which featured singer Eric Carmen), and two incredibly talented & relative newcomers, guitarist/vocalist Lex Marchesi and keyboardist/vocalist Frankie Vinci. Although Marchesi & Vinci were relatively unknown, they were undoubtedly the core talent that drove the band with their versatile songwriting and vocal skills. Fotomaker initially debuted at the newly remodeled Cleveland Agora, early 1978. From all accounts, Fotomaker brought down the house. They were electric. Local Entertainment critics Jane Scott & Anastasia Pantsios from local newspapers both gave GLOWING REVIEWS and Thumbs-up to Fotomaker's premier debut as Atlantic Recording Artists. The band Opened with [...] "CAN I PLEASE HAVE SOMEMORE", with Bryson's intricate riffing on his Gibson Double Neck guitar & Marchesi's soaring 'Lead' on his BC Rich Super Eagle guitar. [...] "ALL THERE IN HER EYES" [...] featured VINCI's lonely Flute solo outtro, that ended with an amazing <b>Echoplexed</b> sound effect. The band managed to incorporate some 'Cover' material. Wally rocked-out on songs like Free's [...] "WISHING WELL" [...] & Todd Rundgren's [...] "COULDN'T I JUST TELL YOU" [...] [...] [...]and their set ended with Lex Marchesi's [...] "TWO CAN MAKE IT WORK". During that period, early 1978, Kid Leo of WMMS radio in Cleveland featured [...] "TWO CAN MAKE IT WORK" [...] into some of his early afternoon song-list offerings. However, it just wasn't enough support for their debut album.|$|R
25|$|In February 2010, Ellison {{started a}} tour through Canada, Europe and the United States. The album release party {{was held on}} May 14, 2010, over two nights at The <b>Echoplex,</b> in Los Angeles. The show had opening {{performances}} from Infinity, Low End resident DJ The Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi, and sound artist Matthewdavid.|$|E

Page also played a theremin.|$|E
500|$|Green Day {{began to}} record {{material}} for the albums ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! on February 14, 2012. During the sessions, Mike Dirnt asked the frontman Billie Joe Armstrong to write a song with a [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] rhythm. After the release of [...] "Oh Love", the lead single from the album trilogy on July 16, 2012, the band revealed the artwork of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] during a press release on July 30, 2012. The band performed the song eight days ahead of its release at a secret show held at the <b>Echoplex</b> on August 6, 2012.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{music was}} written in the rock idiom and {{arranged}} for bass, drums, and strings. As a composer, Axelrod abandoned the conventional unison approach to orchestral writing in favor of more contrasts while centering his tempos around rock-based drum patterns played mostly in common time by Palmer. He utilized his instrumental ensemble as a rock orchestra, playing melodramatic strings and pronounced, echo-laden breakbeats. The music was also embellished with electric piano, intricate basslines, <b>Echoplex</b> effects, and elements of suspense Axelrod used to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. According to David N. Howard, the album's [...] "euphorically" [...] upbeat psychedelic R form was interspersed by [...] "dramatically sparse" [...] and [...] "harrowing" [...] arrangements.|$|E
500|$|For several songs, Saadiq {{incorporated}} lush orchestration and strings as predominant elements. He {{worked on}} the orchestral recording with arranger Paul Riser and Gerry Brown at Ocean Way Recording's Studio B in Los Angeles, while the songs' horn parts were mostly recorded at the Blakeslee studio. Brown also worked with Saadiq on the album's tracking at Blakeslee. The album was mixed using Pro Tools in Blakeslee Recording Company's Studio A, with the SSL 4000 used mostly for monitoring, and using the SSL 9000 in the [...] "C" [...] room. During mixing, Brungardt used equalization filters such as a McDSP FilterBank plug-in and Waves Renaissance EQ to handle excessive high end in spots, and he utilized other equipment for additional sound effects, including a Line 6 Echo Farm, a Roland Space Echo, and an <b>Echoplex</b> clone.|$|E
500|$|Guero, Beck's eighth studio album, was {{recorded}} over {{the span of}} nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound. For example, after recording a [...] "sonically perfect" [...] version of a song {{at one of the}} nicest recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an <b>Echoplex</b> to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: [...] "We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded too good, that was the problem." [...] Initially due to be released in October 2004, Guero faced delays and did not come out till March 2005, though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in January.|$|E
500|$|The mixing {{sessions}} {{of the album}} began in Robert Lang Studios (which were used on the 100 tapes Grohl gave away) but eventually those mixes were discarded and the sessions moved to Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock's [...] "The Shop" [...] studio in Arcata, California. Mixes were done on a 32 channel API DeMedio console, custom built by Frank DeMedio in 1972 for Wally Heider Recording's 'Studio 4'. A Stephen's 24 track 2" [...] tape machine was used for playback. Processors used in the mixes included an Eventide Omnipressor compressor for vocals and guitar solos, an Alan Smart stereo compressor for [...] "squashing" [...] the drums and mixing them back in {{as well as being}} used over the entire mix. Other processors included UREI 1176 and LA3A compressors as well as an <b>Echoplex</b> for delays and a [...] "crappy digital reverb". Mixes were [...] "nothing that crazy" [...] Rob described, adding that he [...] "mixed Big Me in 20 minutes".|$|E
500|$|Lo held {{a concert}} at the Norwegian festival [...] on 27 February 2014. The {{following}} month, she performed a number of tracks at the American South by Southwest festival. On 22 March 2014, the artist sang [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] and [...] "Out of Mind" [...] at Swedish TV show Nyhetsmorgon. Three days later, she held a concert at Tavastia Club in Helsinki, Finland. On 22 April 2014, Lo performed the songs from Truth Serum alongside her collaboration with Lucas Nord, [...] "Run On Love", at live music venue <b>Echoplex</b> in Los Angeles. She performed the same set list for her first show in the United Kingdom at Notting Hill Arts Club on 2 April 2014. For the performance, she was accompanied by two drummers. A reviewer from Discopop stated that he was [...] "blown away" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "so refreshing to be at a pop show that engages the heart as well as the senses". Echoing this thought, Michael Cragg of The Guardian rated the show with four stars out of five and deemed it as [...] "a punchy UK debut".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Echoplex</b> {{is a term}} often applied [...] {{to the use of}} {{multiple}} echoes which recur in approximate synchronization with a musical rhythm, so that the notes played combine and recombine in interesting ways. [...] In fact, it was the name of a particular delay unit, the Maestro <b>Echoplex.</b>|$|E
2500|$|John Martyn was {{a pioneer}} of the <b>echoplex.</b> Perhaps the {{earliest}} indication of his use can be heard on the songs [...] "Would You Believe Me" [...] and [...] "The Ocean" [...] on the album Stormbringer! released in February 1970. [...] "Glistening Glyndebourne" [...] on the album Bless The Weather (1971) showcased his developing technique of playing acoustic guitar through the <b>echoplex.</b> He later went on to [...] experiment with a fuzz box, a volume/wah wah pedal, and the <b>echoplex</b> on Inside Out (1973) and One World (1977). Martyn is cited as an inspiration by many musicians including U2's The Edge.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{designs were}} made; the 1959 Ecco-Fonic had a {{spinning}} head, the Binson Echorec used magnetic recording discs. Many were temperamental, {{such as the}} Vox Echomatic. The most successful of the early machines was the 1959 <b>Echoplex</b> by Mike Battle, [...] "whose sounds are still being experimented with today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many delay {{processors}} {{based on}} analog tape recording, such as Ray Butts' EchoSonic (1952), Mike Battle's <b>Echoplex</b> (1959), or the Roland Space Echo (1973), used magnetic tape as their {{recording and playback}} medium. Electric motors guided a tape loop through a device {{with a variety of}} mechanisms allowing modification of the effect's parameters. In the case of the popular <b>Echoplex</b> EP-2, the [...] play head was fixed, while a combination record and erase head was mounted on a slide, thus the delay time of the echo was adjusted by changing the distance between the record and play heads. In the Space Echo, all of the heads are fixed, but the speed of the tape could be adjusted, changing the delay time. Thin magnetic tape was not entirely suited for continuous operation, however, so the tape loop had to be replaced {{from time to time to}} maintain the audio fidelity of the processed sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Goldsmith {{finished}} out {{the decade}} with noteworthy scores to {{such films as}} the 1985 science-fiction fantasy family film Explorers, 1987 medieval adventure Lionheart, the 1987 science fiction comedy Innerspace, the 1988 action film Rambo III, the 1989 science fiction horror Leviathan, and [...] (1989), his second Star Trek film score. [...] Goldsmith's score to Leviathan (1989) incorporated the use of recorded whale sounds during the main titles. [...] His critically acclaimed comedy score to The 'Burbs (1989) is also noteworthy {{for the use of}} pipe organ, recorded dog barking sound effects, and for parodying the trumpet [...] "call to war" [...] triplets on an <b>echoplex</b> from his previous score to Patton (1970).|$|E
2500|$|While {{the early}} delay units {{with a long}} delay {{capacity}} {{could be used to}} record a riff or chord progression and then play over it, they were challenging to work with. The Paradis LOOP Delay, created in 1992, was the first unit with dedicated looping functions such as Record, Overdub, Multiply, Insert, and Replace, which made it more intuitive and user-friendly. Gibson manufactured a slightly improved version as <b>Echoplex</b> Digital Pro [...] until 2006. Its software Aurisis LOOP is also the last loop tool based on a continuous memory structure as used by tape and digital delays. Most following loopers repeat samples and thus have little in common with a digital delay, the exceptions being Maneco's early looper devices, the Boss DD-20 in digital delay mode and the Pigtronix Echolution.|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen (a {{self-described}} [...] "tone chaser") achieved his distinctive tone {{using the}} EVH [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] guitar, a stock 100-watt Marshall amp, a Variac (to lower the voltage of the amp {{to keep the}} same tone as an amplifier running full-blast at lower volumes), and effects such as an <b>Echoplex,</b> an MXR Phase 90, an MXR Flanger, chorus, and EQs as well as wah since the early 90s. Van Halen constructed his now legendary Frankenstrat guitar using a Boogie Bodies factory [...] "2nd" [...] body, Charvel neck, a single vintage Gibson PAF humbucker pickup sealed in molten surfboard wax done {{at home in a}} coffee can to reduce microphonic feedback (which also warped the bobbin of the pickup), a pre-CBS Fender tremolo bridge (later to be a Floyd Rose bridge) and a single volume control with a knob labeled [...] "tone".|$|E
2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the <b>Echoplex</b> which used a tape loop. [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} tape record and playback heads. [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple playback tape heads and a variable tape speed. [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the tape speed. [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different playback heads. [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|E
2500|$|Goldsmith {{received}} more critical praise with his daring {{music to the}} 1970 World War II biopic Patton. [...] Throughout the score, Goldsmith used an <b>echoplex</b> to loop recorded sounds of [...] "call to war" [...] triplets played on the trumpet that musically represented General George S. Patton's belief in reincarnation. [...] The main theme also consisted of a symphonic march accompanied by a pipe organ to represent the protagonist's militaristic yet deeply religious nature. [...] The film's music subsequently earned Goldsmith an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score {{and was one of}} the American Film Institute's 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores. [...] Goldsmith's critical success continued with his emotional score to the 1973 prison escape film Papillon, which also earned him an Academy Award nomination and a nomination as one of the AFI's top twenty-five American film scores. [...] In 1973, Goldsmith also wrote the theme for the TV series Barnaby Jones.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Goldsmith caught massive {{critical}} {{attention with}} his landmark, controversial soundtrack to the post-apocalyptic science fiction epic Planet of the Apes, {{which was one}} of the first film scores to be written entirely in an Avant garde style. [...] When scoring Planet of the Apes, Goldsmith used such innovative techniques as looping drums into an <b>echoplex,</b> using the orchestra to imitate the grunting sounds of apes, having horns blown without mouthpieces, and instructing the woodwind players to finger their keys without using any air. [...] He also used steel mixing bowls, among other objects, to create unique percussive sounds. [...] The score went on to garner Goldsmith another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score and now ranks in [...] 18 on the American Film Institute's top twenty-five American film scores. [...] Though he did not return to compose for its 1970 sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Goldsmith scored the third installment in the Planet of the Apes franchise, 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Goldsmith {{composed}} a score to the landmark science fiction film Alien. [...] His score featured an orchestra augmented by a shofar, didgeridoo, steel drum, and serpent (a 16th-century instrument), while creating further [...] "alien" [...] sounds by filtering string pizzicati through an <b>echoplex.</b> [...] Many {{of the instruments}} were used in such atypical ways they were virtually unidentifiable. His score was, however, heavily edited during post-production and Goldsmith was required to rewrite music for several scenes. The final score resulted in several pieces being moved, replaced, or cut entirely. [...] Director Ridley Scott and editor Terry Rawlings also, without Goldsmith's consent, purchased {{the rights to the}} [...] "Main Title" [...] from [...] (1962) which they used during the acid blood sequence. [...] Despite the heavy edits and rewrites, Goldsmith's score for the film earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score {{and was one of the}} AFI's 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores. Scott would later prominently reuse Goldsmith's main theme in [...] , released in 2017, scored by Australian musician Jed Kurzel.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, Norlin {{folded and}} their Maestro brand and Market Electronics was forced to find another {{distributor}} for their products. They found that distributor in Harris Teller, a Chicago musical wholesaler. Units built for Harris Teller carried an <b>Echoplex</b> badge that omitted the Maestro name. In 1984, Harris Teller bought out the <b>Echoplex</b> name and the stock of <b>Echoplex</b> parts from Market Electronics. Harris Teller used the back stock to assemble reissues of the EP-3, EP-4, and tube EP-2, which they designated the EP-6t. In 1991, the thirty-year run of electro-mechanical <b>Echoplex</b> production finally came to an end. Towards the middle of that decade the <b>Echoplex</b> brand was purchased by Gibson and applied to its line of digital looping units, one of which was sold under the Oberheim brand as the <b>Echoplex</b> Digital Pro.|$|E

50|$|In music {{performance}} and recording, electric echo effects {{have been used}} since the 1950s. The <b>Echoplex</b> is a tape delay effect, first made in 1959 that recreates {{the sound of an}} acoustic echo. Designed by Mike Battle, the <b>Echoplex</b> set a standard for the effect in the 1960s and was used by most of the notable guitar players of the era; original Echoplexes are highly sought after. While Echoplexes were used heavily by guitar players (and the occasional bass player, such as Chuck Rainey, or trumpeter, such as Don Ejudvntfhllis), many recording studios also used the <b>Echoplex.</b> Beginning in the 1970s, Market built the solid-state <b>Echoplex</b> for Maestro. In the 2000s, most echo effects units use electronic or digital circuitry to recreate the echo effect.|$|E
