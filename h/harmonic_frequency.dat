25|$|When the {{original}} sound sources are perfectly periodic, the note consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the fundamental and the harmonics, partials, or overtones. The sounds have <b>harmonic</b> <b>frequency</b> spectra. The lowest frequency present is the fundamental, {{and is the}} frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency for the total wave to be exactly the same each cycle.

40|$|Using {{steady-state}} visual {{evoked potential}} (SSVEP) in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems {{is the subject of}} a lot of research. One of the most popular and widely used detection method is using a power spectral density analysis (PSDA). Lately there have been some new methods emerging, one of them is using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) which seems to have some promising improvements and advantages compared to traditional SSVEP detection methods, like better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lower inter-subject variability and the possibility to use <b>harmonic</b> <b>frequencies,</b> i. e., a serie of frequencies which have the same fundamental frequency. In this research two different SSVEP detection methods, one using PSDA and one using CCA are compared. The results show that the CCA-based detection method performs significantly better than the PSDA-based detection method. The increase of performance can in particular be seen when using <b>harmonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> While the PSDAbased detection method has difficulties detecting <b>harmonic</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the CCA-based detection method is able to detect <b>harmonic</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|R
