30|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} baseline confidence intervals for haematology, serum biochemistry and leukocyte morphology {{for these two}} species living in captivity.

50|$|As well as {{the native}} death adders, tiger snakes, and several species of lizard {{including}} goannas, many of the islands have introduced mammals such as feral cats, house mice or chinchilla rabbits.

30|$|Both species had neutrophilia, as {{animals were}} {{classified}} as ‘healthy’ and did not show signs of inflammation, {{the cause of the}} condition can be assumed to be physiologic as a result of epinephrine or from stress (Harvey 2012). Neutrophils, usually make up 20 – 30  % (Provencher Bolliger and Everds 2012) of leukocytes. In tree-rats (44  %) and <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> (64  %) numbers of neutrophils were much higher than anticipated. Lymphocytes are usually the predominant leukocyte and can be as high as 70 – 80  % of the differential WBC count in the laboratory mouse (Provencher Bolliger and Everds 2012), however in the black-footed tree-rat lymphocytes were just below 50  % and made up 32  % of all WBCs in the <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats.</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> (Leporillus conditor) is a {{vulnerable}} species (IUCN 2014) previously found {{across much of}} the semi-arid and arid zone of Australia (Van Dyck and Strahan 2008). Currently, there is only one natural population located on Franklin Island in the Nuyts Archipelago, South Australia (Robinson 1975). The species has been bred in captivity and successfully re-introduced to a conservation reserve near Roxby Downs (South Australia), Reevesby Island (South Australia) (Arid Recovery 2007), St Peters Island (South Australia) and Salutation Island (Western Australia) (Morris 2000). Weighing 180 – 450  g, the ground dwelling stick-nest rat is vulnerable to predation by native and introduced predators.|$|E
30|$|The black-footed tree-rat (Mesembriomys gouldii) and <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> (Leporillus conditor) {{are near}} {{threatened}} and vulnerable native Australian murids. There is {{a paucity of}} health and welfare knowledge for these species and native murids in general. In this paper we aimed to address this deficiency in knowledge by describing some key haematological and blood biochemistry parameters for these species. Haematology and blood biochemistry data were obtained from clinical histories of the two murid species held in captivity at Taronga Zoological Park, Mosman, Australia. The data were analysed to establish confidence intervals for each parameter available and leukocyte morphology described. White blood cell counts were higher in females than males. Both species also had high neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios (tree-rat ratios were almost even). Haematocrit was higher in male stick-nest rats than females. Differential leukocyte counts and leukocyte morphology was consistent with previous descriptions in other murids and between individuals. Blood biochemistry values were unremarkable except for {{the high level of}} globulin in stick-nest rats. The values provided in the study will add to the knowledge of health data for murids in captivity and aid captive and natural management of Australian native murids.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{constant}} {{threats to}} the long-term population survival of the two species, in situ conservation efforts alone are not sufficient to ensure their survival. Long-term survival of these wild populations relies on maintaining captive populations, and maintaining the health of these animals is critical in the captive setting. It is also very often assumed that the health parameters of native murids {{are the same as}} domesticated laboratory murids despite the two groups of murids being distinctly separated taxonomically at the sub-Family level (Van Dyck and Strahan 2008). In addition, the causes and consequences of disease in native murid species are generally poorly understood, particularly for Australian species, and long-term data sets are required for health and disease studies. For example, there is generally a paucity of information regarding the haematology, serum biochemistry and leukocyte morphology for most Australian native murids, with only a few having previously been documented for captive specimens (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007). Haematology and serum biochemistry values for the black-footed tree-rat and <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> are needed as differences in physiology and life history traits compared to other murids, means values for other species are not directly comparable.|$|E
30|$|Comparative {{fundamental}} {{descriptions of}} the morphology, relative numbers of leukocytes, and the serum biochemistry of two native Australian murids were provided in this paper to establish a baseline for presumably healthy individuals living in captivity. Our data indicated the values had some variation when comparing genders; however further data is required to determine how age influences blood parameters in these species, specifically in WBC counts in both species as well as N:L ratios/percentages and HCT in <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats.</b> Compared to other captive murids <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> had higher levels of globulin and requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals established {{provide a basis for}} monitoring the health status of captive individual black-footed tree-rats and <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> and aid the long-term survival of these captive murid populations. The cause, consequence and impact of disease in native murid species remain poorly understood, and further long-term data sets are required to fully understand health and disease in these species, as well as blood samples from wild individuals.|$|R
5000|$|Tiger {{snakes and}} {{southern}} carpet pythons {{occur in the}} archipelago. <b>Greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> are found on the Franklin Islands. An isolated subspecies of the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus nauticus) is endemic to the archipelago and confined to St Francis and the Franklin Islands. An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} reestablish a colony of brush-tailed bettongs on St Francis Island, where the species had previously become extinct; a similar introduction to St Peter Island has been more successful. [...] The archipelago is important for Australian sea lions; it contains eight breeding colonies as well as several haul-out sites.

40|$|Reintroduction {{programs}} for threatened species often include elaborate release strategies {{designed to improve}} success, but their advantages are rarely tested scientifically. We used a set of four experiments {{to demonstrate that the}} influence of release strategies on short-term reintroduction outcomes is related to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We compared different reintroduction strategies for three mammal species in an arid environment where exotic mammalian predators were removed. Wild <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> selected vegetation shelter sites with greater structural density than captive-bred rats, travelled further from the release site and experienced lower rates of mortality. In comparison, {{there was no difference in}} mortality or movement between wild and captive-bred greater bilbies. Burrowing bettongs and greater bilbies were also subjected to immediate and delayed release strategies and whilst no difference was detected in bilbies, bettongs that were subjected to delayed releases lost less weight and took less time to establish burrows than those that were immediately released. Interspecific differences in treatment response were attributed to predation risk, the nature of the release site, and behavioural traits such as shelter investment and sociality. Our varied results highlight the inadequacies of review articles focusing on optimum release protocols due to their attempt to generalise across species and release sites. We provide an example of a predictive model to guide future release strategy experimentation that recognises the range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing reintroduction outcomes. We encourage researchers to treat programs experimentally, identif...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} {{mathematical}} models {{has been developed}} to infer whether a species is extinct based on a sighting record. Although observations have variable reliability, current methods for detecting extinction do not differentiate observation qualities. A more suitable approach would consider certain and uncertain sightings throughout the sighting period. We consider a small population system, meaning we assume sighting rates are constant and the population is not declining. Based on such an assumption, we develop a Bayesian method that assumes that certain and uncertain sightings occur independently and at uniform rates. These two types of sightings are connected by a common extinction date. Several rates of false sightings can be calculated to differentiate between observation types. Prior rates of false and true sightings, {{as well as a}} prior probability that the species is extant, are included. The model is implemented in OpenBugs, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Based on records of variable reliability, we estimate the probability that the following species are extinct: Caribbean seal Monachus tropicalis, grey, black-footed ferret Mustela nigripes, Audubon & Bachman, <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> Leporillus conditor, Sturt, and lesser stick-nest rat Leporillus apicalis, Gould. As further examples, Birdlife International provided the sighting records for the Alaotra grebe Tachybaptus rufolavatus, Delacour, Jamaica petrel Pterodroma caribbaea, Carte, and Pohnpei mountain starling Aplonis pelzelni, Finsch, with prior probabilities for extinction. The results are compared with existing methods, which ignore uncertain sightings. We find that including uncertain sightings can considerably change the probability that the species is extant, in either direction. However, in our examples, including the quality of the uncertain sighting made little difference. When we ignore uncertain sightings, our results agree with existing methods, especially when the last sighting was {{near the end of the}} sighting period. Synthesis and applications. Estimating the probability that a species is extinct based on sighting records is important when determining conservation priorities and allocating available resources into management activities. Having a model that allows for certain and uncertain observations throughout the sighting period better accommodates the realities of sighting quality, providing a more reliable basis for decision-making.

40|$|Browsing by {{introduced}} cattle (Bos taurus) {{and rabbits}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can limit {{the recruitment of}} some arid zone tree and shrub species. In a study conducted at the Arid Recovery Reserve, Roxby Downs, SA, we aimed to quantify initial recruitment changes in shrubs after the removal of cattle and rabbits and the re-introduction of locally extinct fauna. The presence and abundance of seedlings was measured at groves of seven native perennial shrubs over 6 years under four browsing treatments: (1) ‘reserve-reintroductions’ [re-introduced <b>greater</b> <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> (Leporillus conditor), burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur) and greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) ], (2) ‘reserve-no browsers’, (3) ‘pastoral-stocked’ (rabbits and cattle), and (4) ‘pastoral-destocked’ (rabbits). Recruitment of mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell. ex Benth.), silver cassia (Senna artemisioides subsp. petiolaris Randell) and sandhill wattle (Acacia ligulata A. Cunn. ex Benth.) was significantly greater in the two browsing regimes inside the Reserve than in the two pastoral regimes. The number of recruits of these three species declined at ‘pastoral-destocked’ and ‘pastoral-stocked’ sites but increased at ‘reserve-reintroductions’ and ‘reserve-no browsers’ sites from 2001 to 2006. Narrow-leaf hopbush (Dodonaea viscose (L.) Jacq.) showed a trend towards increased recruitment at sites in both browsing regimes inside the Reserve, but decreased recruitment at sites in both pastoral regimes. Native plum (Santalum lanceolatum R. Br.), native apricot (Pittosporum phylliraeoides orth. var. DC.) and bullock bush (Alectryon oleifolius (Desf.) S. T. Reynolds) exhibited {{no significant difference in}} recruitment between the four browsing regimes within the study timeframe. These results suggest that excluding rabbits and stock may benefit the germination and survival of mulga, silver cassia and sandhill wattle. To date, re-introduced native herbivores at low numbers have not been found to negatively affect the recruitment or growth rate of the seven perennial plant species studied. Nicola T.

30|$|In {{comparison}} to other captive murids, the captive Australian native tree-rats and <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> presented {{differences in their}} leukocyte morphology, haematology and serum biochemistry. The haematology and serum biochemistry values were relatively consistent between individuals, despite the use of different analysis equipment and regardless of some differences in collection methods between individuals. WBC counts were higher in females in both species. Both species also had high N:L ratios (tree-rat ratios were almost even). HCT was higher in male <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> than females. Differential leukocyte counts and leukocyte morphology was consistent with previous descriptions in other murids and between individuals. Blood biochemistry values were unremarkable except for {{the high level of}} globulin in <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> when compared to previous murid research (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Healthy {{specimens}} of both species had elevated total WBC counts {{in comparison to}} the other murids (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012). Tree-rats had a mean WBC count that was almost double that reported previously for murids, while the <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> were within the expected range for murids, but at the higher end. <b>Stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> had a higher WBC count when compared to other murids (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012) and had a small standard deviation, suggesting the values are likely to be a true indication of ‘healthy’ <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> WBC counts. The differences in tree-rat mean WBC counts were different between the two sexes, females having higher counts. A larger sample size is needed to accurately determine species reference values (Table  2).|$|R

30|$|Globulin values include {{levels of}} enzymes, antibodies, and fibrous and {{contractile}} proteins. The <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> {{had a mean}} of 30.2  g/L globulin, 8.9 – 17.8  g/L above the current reported murid range (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012). The cause or effect of high globulin in rodents has not been investigated in detail. However in humans, high globulin can indicate chronic inflammation, an infectious disease, leukaemia, diseases of the liver or kidneys, or an autoimmune disease (Willard and Tvendten 2012). <b>Stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> {{over the age of}} 4  years did display a higher globulin level than their younger counterparts, presumably as they had been exposed to more pathogens than the younger animals. As the expected longevity of free-ranging <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> is 4  years (Jackson 2007), advanced age (or the wide range of ages of murids in this study) is a reasonable explanation for these high values.|$|R
30|$|High {{neutrophil}} to lymphocyte ratios {{are useful}} indicators of poor health or stress (Old et al. 2005). On average both species had high N:L ratios, possibly {{a result of}} neutrophilia. A fifth of the <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> were skewed (6.6 – 11.5), while all other ratios were < 4.0, which {{may account for the}} high mean ratio. Compared to other captive murids (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012), both species had very high N:L ratios, with tree-rats three times and <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats</b> six times larger than previously reported murid N:L values.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> middens are {{preserved}} piles of macrofossils that record changes in {{plants and animals}} during the late Holocene at White Range. The builders, Lesser <b>Stick-nest</b> <b>Rats</b> (Leporillus apicalis), after at least 2500 years in the area, became extinct during the Modern radiocarbon period. The rats' collection {{of plant and animal}} material provides an ecological survey of the site during this period. The species composition of the vegetation has apparently responded to increased Aboriginal populations, ire incidence or rainfall in the last 2500 years. A dramatic increase in tree and shrub material between 2510 &PLUSMN; 40 BP and 835 &PLUSMN; 62 BP at the expense of herbs is possibly related to increasing moisture availability. The middens record a collapse of trees and shrubs by 606 &PLUSMN; 136 BP then a strong recovery. Grasses have generally decreased in importance throughout the record. Bones of the Central Rock Rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus), which is currently restricted to the western MacDonnell Ranges, were found in middens dated at 433 &PLUSMN; 60 BP.

50|$|Australia may be {{isolated}} by sea, but technically through Wallacea {{it can be}} zoologically extended. An example of evidence for when Wallacea formed exists at the Bluff Downs fossil site in northern Australia. Remains of basaltic lava show past oceanic subduction as Australia ploughed north through the Pacific. At the site, {{one of the earliest}} Australian rodent fossils has been found. Australia's rodents make up much of the continent's placental mammal fauna and include various species from <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rats,</b> hopping mice, and even giant beaver rats.

30|$|ALP is {{associated}} with measurements of skeletal growth {{and can be used}} as an indicator of age, with levels decreasing as the animal reaches adulthood (Calabuig et al. 2010). Tree-rat ALP was higher in older animals than younger animals and was not consistent with previous murid values (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012). <b>Stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> ALP values were low in young individuals, peaked around 2.5  years, and dropped again when animals reached 4  years. In quolls (Stannard et al. 2013) and other murid species (Old et al. 2005) ALP levels varied greatly between individuals. High ALP has been seen as an effect of captivity in the black vulture (Aegypius monachus), as well as poor health (Villegas et al. 2002). Whilst higher ALP values have also been reported in healthy captive southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) compared to wild wombats (Gaughwin and Judson 1980). A larger number of samples with a wider range of ages are needed to determine the reasoning behind the variability in the results and whether captive management is affecting the ALP values of these species.|$|R
50|$|Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Nuyts Archipelago off {{the west coast of}} Eyre Peninsula in South Australia within 10 km to 75 km south-west of Ceduna. The wilderness protection area was proclaimed in August 2011 under the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 in order to protect ‘important island habitat for species such as the <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> and brush-tailed bettongs (which are part of re-introduction programs) and species such as the carpet python and short-nosed bandicoot’ and habitat for ‘other notable species’ including the Australian sea lion and mutton birds.

40|$|Palaeoecological {{records for}} {{semi-arid}} and arid environments of Australia {{are limited to}} poor preservation of material in this environmental setting. A s a consequence, a Holocene vegetation and climatic record for {{a large part of}} the continent is incomplete. Leporillus spp. (<b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat)</b> middens provide a wealth of palaeoecological information for Holocene environments in areas where such records are rare. Eighteen middens from three key sites in the Flinders Ranges (Arkaroola-Mount Painter Sanctuary, Mount Chambers Gorge and Brachina Gorge), were investigated in this project to provide a thorough spatial and temporal coverage of palaeoecological sites. Issues of midden taphonomy, temporal resolution of pollen and macrofossil evidence, refining the interpretation of palaeoecological records from middens, and reconstructing palaeovegetation and climates during the Holocene, are dominant themes of this research. Modern pollen rain at study sites was investigated to provide the foundation for interpretation of palaeoecological evidence from the <b>stick-nest</b> <b>rat</b> middens. A study of the regional modern pollen rain along a west-east transect in the central and northern Flinders Ranges reflected the high spatial variability in vegetation communities from semi-arid rocky upland environments. Local environmental conditions at individual midden sites (aspect and degree of exposure at cave sites and local vegetation cover) were significant factors in determining the composition of the modern pollen rain at individual midden sites. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating was used to examine the taphonomy of middens and refine the temporal resolution of these deposits. The majority of middens were found to have been deposited rapidly. Temporal resolution of middens can be complex, however in most instances, there were contemporaneous ages of different components in the middens (leaves, pollen concentrates and faecal pellets). AMS dating provided reliable ages for individual middens. Vegetation taxa were better represented by pollen rather than macrofossils in the midden assemblages as evidenced by MacrofossihPollen Index values. Macrofossils are regarded as a secondary line of evidence in these midden records. They can verify the local occurrence of a taxon, whose source (local or regional) may not be distinguished solely in the pollen record. Pollen and macrofossil records suggest that woodland and shrubland communities with an understorey of herbaceous taxa and grasses were dominant around 7 000 - 5 000 yrs B. P in the northern ranges, and shrublands with an understorey of herbaceous taxa and chenopods were dominant in the central ranges. This is indicative of wetter and warmer conditions than present during this part of the Holocene. Shrubland communities declined in the central ranges while persisting in the north from 4 000 - 2 000 yrs B. P, to be replaced by chenopod shrublands with a less diverse herbaceous component in the understorey with increasing aridity into the Late Holocene. Chenopod shrublands continued to increase from 1 000 yrs B. P to the present in the central ranges. Midden records have provided evidence for a shift between transitional shrubland communities to chenopod shrublands in the central ranges. T o the north, woodland and shrublands remained throughout the Holocene. Topographically buffered vegetation in the northern ranges is more resilient than central ranges vegetation to climate change. Change in vegetation communities was more visible in the central ranges, as a result of different environmental conditions more sensitive to changes in effective precipitation. This highlights the complexity of factors that affect plant distributions in semi-arid environments. Underlying the climatically driven response is the role of biogeographic parameters that influence the diversity and structure of different vegetation communities. In sheltered rugged topography, in the northern ranges, plant communities are more stable as evidenced by the occurrence of relict species and maintenance of woodland and shrubland communities throughout the Holocene even as conditions were becoming increasingly arid. The same climatic scenario of increasing aridity in the central ranges resulted in less stable vegetation communities that responded to cooler and drier conditions by shifting from dominantly shrublands to an extensive cover of chenopod shrublands. Present spatial variability in the vegetation being a feature of the last 1 000 yrs (and possibly longer in the central ranges), compared with more homogeneous conditions across the ranges from 7 000 - 5 000 yrs B. P, is certainly consistent with the argument that climatic parameters such as ENSO have become more variable during the Late Holocene...|$|R
