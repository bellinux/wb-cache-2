5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics. It received a top rating of four stars from Roger Ebert, who described the movie as [...] "hilarious, and cockeyed, and warm." [...] In his New York Times review, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a beautifully and gently cockeyed movie that recalls {{at least two}} different traditions of American film comedy... The entire project is touched by a fine and knowing madness." [...] The film was placed at #2 on <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> list of the best movies of 1971.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981 Tattoo for Joseph Levine Presents {{released}} by Twentieth Century Fox. Bruce Dern plays a tattoo artist obsessed with a fashion model, Maude Adams who he eventually kidnaps and tattoos. According to Roger Ebert, [...] "Tattoo opens so promisingly that its crucial scenes are doubly disappointing. Because the film's first hour {{makes it clear}} that Tattoo is not intended as just another creepy horror film, the failure of the conclusion is all the more disappointing." [...] On the other hand it was Ebert's partner, <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> choice for a winner that lost at the box office.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Ebert, {{along with}} {{colleague}} <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel,</b> guest-starred on {{an episode of}} the animated TV series The Critic. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film Sleepless in Seattle. The following year, Ebert appeared in Pitch, a documentary by Canadian film makers Spencer Rice and Kenny Hotz. He made an appearance as himself in a 1997 episode of the television series Early Edition, {{which took place in}} Chicago.

Hosoda answered audience questions following the film's screening through an interpreter. Hosoda and a producer subsequently appeared at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Comparative Media Studies Program on March 1, 2010, where they offered a public screening free of charge and answered questions.

500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that Labyrinth {{was made with}} [...] "infinite care and pains", Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four as {{he felt that the}} film [...] "never really comes alive". Ebert said that as the film was set in an [...] "arbitrary world" [...] none of the events in it had any consequences, robbing the film of any dramatic tension. <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> review of Labyrinth for the Chicago Tribune was highly negative, and he referred to it as an [...] "awful" [...] film with a [...] "pathetic story", [...] "much too complicated plot" [...] and a [...] "visually ugly style". Siskel objected to the film's [...] "violent" [...] plot, writing, [...] "the sight of a baby in peril is one of sleaziest gimmicks a film can employ to gain our attention, but Henson does it." ...|$|R
5000|$|This film {{appeared}} on both Roger Ebert's and <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> Top 10 list of 1971. Listed as No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Roger Ebert commented, [...] "The official East Coast line on John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday {{was that it}} is civilized. That judgment was enlisted to carry the critical defense of the movie; and, indeed, how can the decent critic be against a civilized movie about civilized people? My notion, all the same, is that Sunday Bloody Sunday is about {{people who suffer from}} psychic amputation, not civility, and that this film is not an affirmation but a tragedy...I think 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a masterpiece, but I don't think it's about what everybody else seems to think it's about. This is not a movie about the loss of love, but about its absence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Positive reviews {{came from}} critics Roger Ebert and <b>Gene</b> Siskel; <b>Siskel</b> {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "surprisingly entertaining", and Ebert said that the film was clever in how it [...] "combines the conventions of the horror and disaster genres" [...] and [...] "is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{documentary}} 70 Acres in Chicago, about Cabrini–Green by Ronit Bezalel, {{who spent}} two decades there beginning in 1995 was screened at the <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> Film Center in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Roger Ebert never officially {{reviewed}} Pee-wee's Big Adventure but in 1987 it topped {{his list}} of Guilty Pleasures and he did mention it in his review of Big Top Pee-wee, saying the sequel was not as magical as the first. The second paragraph of that review contrasted the two films explaining what he liked in Big Adventure that he didn't like in Big Top. <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel,</b> however, gave Pee-wee's Big Adventure a negative review and even called {{it one of the}} worst movies of 1985.|$|E
25|$|Scream 2 {{received}} equally positive critical response {{with some}} critics {{arguing that the}} film surpassed the original in scares and humor. Both <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> and the New York Times Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to Scream. The film failed {{to achieve the same}} success as the original in terms of awards however, winning only the 1998 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell plus Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Horror Film for Campbell, Cox and Scream 2 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> [...] "thumbs-up" [...] review at {{the time}} also noted the film {{successfully}} captured the book's themes into film, adding [...] "What the film is about and what the book is about is using Las Vegas {{as a metaphor for}} – or a location for – the worst of America, the extremes of America, the money obsession, the visual vulgarity of America." [...] Michael O'Sullivan gave the film a positive review in the Washington Post. [...] "What elevates the tale from being a mere drug chronicle is the same thing that lifted the book into the realm of literature. It's the sense that Gilliam, like Thompson, is always totally in command of the medium, while abandoning himself utterly to unpredictable forces beyond his control." [...] Empire magazine voted the film the 469th greatest film in their [...] "500 Greatest Movies of All Time" [...] list.|$|R
5000|$|Noted American {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film {{one-half}} {{of a star}} and listed Spice World {{as one of his}} most hated films, saying: [...] "The Spice Girls are easier to tell apart than the Mutant Ninja Turtles, but that is small consolation: What can you say about five women whose principal distinguishing characteristic is that they have different names? They occupy [...] "Spice World" [...] as if they were watching it: They're so detached they can't even successfully lip-synch their own songs." [...] And when he reviewed the film on his and <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> film critique programme Siskel & Ebert, only three weeks into 1998, he declared that he had already seen the worst film of that year, and called it [...] "an entertainment-free dead zone". Ebert would include this film on the Worst of 1998 special; but he chose Armageddon as the worst film of 1998.|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt Back to the Future {{had similar}} themes to the films of Frank Capra, {{especially}} It's a Wonderful Life. Ebert commented [...] " [...] Steven Spielberg is emulating the great authentic past of Classical Hollywood cinema, {{who specialized in}} matching the right director (Robert Zemeckis) with the right project." [...] He gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times believed the film had a balanced storyline: [...] "It's a cinematic inventing of humor and whimsical tall tales {{for a long time}} to come." [...] Christopher Null, who first saw the film as a teenager, called it [...] "a quintessential 1980s flick that combines science fiction, action, comedy, and romance all into a perfect little package that kids and adults will both devour." [...] Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader felt Gale and Zemeckis wrote a script that perfectly balanced science fiction, seriousness and humor. Variety praised the performances, arguing Fox and Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. BBC News lauded the intricacies of the [...] "outstandingly executed" [...] script, remarking that [...] "nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later." [...] Back to the Future appeared on <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> top ten film list of 1985.|$|R
25|$|Crawford {{starred in}} the 1981 Disney comedy/adventure film Condorman, playing an {{eccentric}} American comic book writer and illustrator named Woody Wilkins who is asked by his friend at the CIA to help a Russian woman to defect while acting out the fantasy of bringing his comic book creation, Condorman, to life. Critics panned the film. On their television show, critics <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> and Roger Ebert featured the film in their round-up of the year's worst films pointing out the less-than-special effects such as the visible harness and cable used to suspend Condorman {{in the air and}} the obvious bluescreen effect. The film performed poorly at the box office but years later gained a cult following among Disney fans.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the {{character}} of General Kael (Pat Roach) on the film critic Pauline Kael, a fact that {{was not lost on}} Kael in her printed review of the film. She referred to General Kael as an [...] "homage a moi". Similarly, the two-headed dragon was named [...] "Sispert" [...] after film critics <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> and Roger Ebert.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1975, Ebert and <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> began co-hosting {{a weekly}} film review {{television}} show, Sneak Previews, which was locally {{produced by the}} Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. The series was later picked up for nationwide syndication on PBS. The duo became famous for their [...] "thumbs up/thumbs down" [...] review summaries. Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase [...] "Two Thumbs Up".|$|E
5000|$|Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-Manhattan {{disaster}} flick {{has been}} written with the brain dead in mind. The script isn't just 'dumbed down,' it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone. —James Berardinelli, writing in ReelViews Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that [...] "One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes {{no sense at all}} except as a careless pastiche of its betters (and, yes, the Japanese Godzilla movies are, in their way, better—if only because they embrace dreck instead of condescending to it). You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome." [...] Ebert also pointed out in his review that the characters Mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene were Devlin and Emmerich's jabs at his and <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel's</b> negative reviews of Stargate and Independence Day. And Gene placed it on his list of the worst films of 1998. In an entirely negative review, James Berardinelli writing for ReelViews, called the film [...] "one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time, it's like spitting into the wind. Emmerich and Devlin are master illusionists, waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors. It's probably too much to hope that some day, movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "is so clumsily structured it feels as if it's two different movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto the end. The only question worth asking about this $120 million wad of popcorn is a commercial one. How much further will the dumbing down of the event movie have to go before the audience stops buying tickets?" ...|$|R
500|$|Ebert {{was one of}} the {{principal}} critics featured in Gerald Peary's 2009 documentary film [...] He is shown discussing the dynamics of appearing with <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> on the 1970s show Coming to a Theatre Near You, which was the predecessor of Sneak Previews on Chicago PBS station WTTW. He also expressed his approval of the proliferation of young people writing film reviews today on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} film [...] "the most brilliantly {{disturbing}} film {{ever to have}} its roots in small-town American life," [...] describing it as [...] "shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled." [...] Film critic <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> included Blue Velvet on his list of the best films of 1986, at the fifth spot. Peter Travers, film critic for Rolling Stone, named it the best film of the 1980s and {{referred to it as}} an [...] "American masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> helped popularize nationally {{televised}} film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously named At the Movies programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase [...] "Two Thumbs Up," [...] used when both hosts gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting {{the show with}} various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.|$|E
500|$|On the {{syndicated}} television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> gave Angel Heart a [...] "thumbs down", while his colleague Roger Ebert praised {{the film and}} gave it a [...] "thumbs up". In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Siskel wrote that [...] "Parker seems more concerned with style and with hiding the film's big mystery than with pacing." [...] Siskel also criticized the film's controversial sex scene for not being [...] "as shocking as the rating board would have you believe." ...|$|E
500|$|The film grossed $98 million {{against its}} $52 million budget. Critical {{response}} was generally positive {{and the film}} was nominated for seven Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Sound. It won the Golden Bear at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival. Martin Scorsese ranked it as his second favorite film of the 1990s. On At the Movies, <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> called it [...] "the greatest contemporary war film I've seen".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave {{a largely}} {{positive}} review: [...] "What Burton has made {{is a film}} which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of 1950s exploitation films, in which a great title, a has-been star and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings {{for some of the}} oddest films ever made." [...] Ebert and <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> gave the film [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] on Siskel and Ebert, with Siskel calling it [...] "a tribute to creative passion and to friendship" [...] and [...] "one of the year's very best".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} the quality of the film's special effects. Newsweeks David Ansen claimed the special effects were of no better caliber than those seen nineteen years earlier in Star Wars. Todd McCarthy of Variety felt the production's budget-conscious approach resulted in [...] "cheesy" [...] shots that lacked in quality relative to the effects present in films directed by James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. In his review, Roger Ebert took note of a lack of imagination in the spaceship and creature designs. <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> expressed the same sentiments in his At the Movies review of the film.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of Variety {{thought that}} the film should have {{remained}} an episode of Tales from the Crypt. Critic James Berardinelli believed that although The Frighteners wasn't [...] "a bad film", it was [...] "a disappointment, following Jackson's powerful, true-life matricide tale, Heavenly Creatures", {{and because of that}} [...] "The Frighteners fell short of expectations by being just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert, felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> gave it a [...] "two thumbs down" [...] rating on their TV show At the Movies with <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> and Roger Ebert. Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film's special effects as [...] "ugly, aggressive" [...] and [...] "proliferating", saying that [...] "trying to keep interested in [...] was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [...] ear". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman's music score". The Austin Chronicles Joey O'Brien, said that although the screenplay was [...] "practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations", it [...] "switched gears" [...] too fast and too frequently that [...] "the audience is left struggling to catch up as [...] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale".|$|E
500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> of the Chicago Tribune, {{felt that}} the film was [...] "far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight". Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "It feels morose and unrelieved, {{despite the efforts of}} ..." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long {{to live up to its}} ambitious premise." [...] Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "takes a while to hook you into its story. This is one {{occasion}} we can afford the wait; Parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting in the 1952, {{the theater}} {{attempted}} {{to appeal to}} the cultural influences in the neighborhood by showing German-language films in addition to American films. [...] The theater eventually transformed to a German film house, even acting as host for the Chicago International Film Festival in 1972 where they opened with Signs of Life. [...] The Davis continued to show German films {{through the end of the}} decade. The theater then transitioned to showing a variety of entertainment including puppet shows, second run films, and revivals through the 1970s. In 1979, a plan to revitalize the theater by modernizing it and concentrating on movie revivals was supported by film critic and Chicago resident <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel,</b> but it was unsuccessful within months.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli {{enjoyed the}} film. [...] "It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, {{and a whole}} lot more {{colorful}} than before." [...] Scott Beatty felt [...] "Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue." [...] Lee Bermejo called Batman Forever [...] "unbearable". <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: [...] "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke." [...] Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding [...] "a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Despite initial {{negative}} reactions from comics fans {{prior to the}} film's release, Keaton's portrayal of Batman was generally praised. James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, [...] "the best thing {{that can be said}} about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort." [...] Variety felt [...] "Jack Nicholson stole every scene" [...] but still greeted the film with positive feedback. Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed [...] "Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about." [...] He also called the film [...] "a depressing experience". His reviewing partner <b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> disagreed, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws you into a psychological world'.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>Siskel</b> {{described}} it as the [...] "finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986." [...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm {{idea of what it}} is about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E
