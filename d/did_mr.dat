500|$|On 25 October 1636, seven ministers {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a [...] "private conference" [...] which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached, and Cotton [...] "gave satisfaction to them , so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification." [...] Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the New Testament. [...] Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential. [...] A year later, her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob {{wakes up}} {{on a normal}} day as usual and {{attempts}} {{to hang out with}} Patrick, Squidward and Sandy, however he ends up angering them each, causing them to angrily call him [...] "Idiot Boy". SpongeBob heads to the Krusty Krab but ends up creating a mishap that results in getting two dollars fried and reduced to bits, with a furious Mr. Krabs kicking him out of the restaurant and like the others <b>did,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs furiously calls SpongeBob [...] "Idiot Boy". SpongeBob decides to leave Bikini Bottom and tells Gary that he has a year's supply of snail food to eat since SpongeBob will not be there to feed him. After leaving Bikini Bottom, he is frightened by bizarre people and as he runs in fear, SpongeBob falls off a cliff and bumps his head, knocking himself unconscious.

500|$|On 25 October 1636, seven ministers {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Cotton to confront the developing discord, holding a private conference which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. [...] Some agreement was reached concerning the theological differences, and Cotton [...] "gave satisfaction to , so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification." [...] The agreement was short-lived, and Cotton, Hutchinson, and their supporters were being accused of a number of heresies, including antinomianism and familism. [...] Antinomianism means [...] "against or opposed to the law" [...] and theologically means that a person considers himself not bound to obey any moral or spiritual law. [...] Familism is named for a 16th-century sect called the Family of Love; it teaches that a person can attain a perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin and the responsibility for it. [...] Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and Vane were antagonists of the orthodox party, but Cotton's theological differences from the colony's other ministers were {{at the center of the}} controversy.|$|E
500|$|Following the broadcast, the IOC {{provisionally}} suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade {{him from}} attending the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jacques Rogge {{claimed he was}} [...] "an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules," [...] underlining that [...] "Under my leadership, I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour". An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way <b>did</b> <b>Mr</b> Slavkov object to this discussion {{of the terms of}} a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were {{likely to be able to}} influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that [...] "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." [...] It goes on to say that Slavkov received [...] "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" [...] and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services. The report concluded: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Thompson {{provided}} the narration for Jason Reitman's film Men, Women & Children, before seeing {{the release of}} a project she had been working on for many years. The period drama Effie Gray, based on the true-life story of art critic John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. [...] The American playwright Gregory Murphy claimed that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which deals with the same story. Murphy was initially offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson by Potboiler Productions, the original producers of Effie Gray, in settlement of his claim, but this settlement offer was impugned by the film's subsequent producers, Ms. Thompson and Donald Rosenfeld, who instigated the suit. In March 2013, the judge in the case, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed [...] "some of the most troubling material" [...] had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were [...] "quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events". Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. [...] Thompson also appeared in the film, alongside her husband Greg Wise and actress Dakota Fanning, but declined to promote it as <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wise.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Figgis based Leaving Las Vegas on a 1990 autobiographical {{novel by}} John O'Brien, who {{committed}} suicide in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being made into a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment with the novel, stating [...] "Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jones, because I think manic-depression is a fascinating, sad, and amazing phenomenon. It's not a coincidence {{that some of the}} greatest artists have been manic-depressive. That made it, to me, a fascinating subject that, alas, did not come out in the film".|$|E
2500|$|Hart-Davis {{believes}} that Peter Fleming failed {{to consider the}} possibility that Mr. A. had unknowingly transmitted the communications [...] "telepathically and subconsciously" [...] to Vera. Certainly the [...] "slushy" [...] prose in Take Over and the other manuscripts were the sort a man like Mr. A. with his background would perpetrate. The manuscripts frequently used the adjective [...] "pleasurable" [...] as <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> A. in conversation; even Mr. A.'s initial letter to Peter Fleming promised [...] "very pleasurable news concerning your late brother Ian." [...] A communication purportedly from Maugham claimed that the deceased authors wished for those still alive to believe life continues after death and that [...] "life goes on and very pleasurably I can assure you.".|$|E
2500|$|Dune was {{the first}} major {{ecological}} science fiction novel. Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In Dune he helped popularize the term ecology and some of the field's concepts, vividly imparting a sense of planetary awareness. Gerald Jonas explains in The New York Times Book Review: [...] "So completely <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that Dune became the standard for a new subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction." [...] As popularity of Dune rose, Herbert embarked on a lecture tour of college campuses, explaining how the environmental concerns of Dune's inhabitants were analogous to our own.|$|E

2500|$|Woods {{appeared}} {{against the}} Australians shortly thereafter, playing for 'Cambridge University Past and Present', but rejoined them for matches against Yorkshire and Surrey, {{the latter of}} which drew his best performance for the Australians, when he claimed four wickets, {{over a third of}} his total for the side. He claimed two wickets in each of the other two Test matches, but failed to reach double figures when batting in any innings. Australia lost both matches, granting England a 2–1 series victory. Grace observed that [...] "neither with bat nor ball <b>did</b> <b>Mr.</b> S. M. J. Woods give promise of the sterling qualities of which he proved himself the possessor as years went on. Woods, in his reminiscences, only provides a paragraph on his time playing for the Australians, and concentrates mainly on the first-ball duck he made in the match at Old Trafford, Manchester. These three Test appearances for Australia were the only he made for his native country; he was invited to play for them again when they toured England in 1890, but had to decline due to injury. In 1889, Woods was named by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of the [...] "Six Great Bowlers of the Year" [...] due to his performances for Cambridge and Australia.
