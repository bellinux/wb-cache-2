We discuss {{geometric}} positioning, highlighting of visited {{nodes and}} user defined highlighting {{that form the}} algorithm animation facilities in the Grrr graph rewriting programming language. The main purpose of animation was initially for the debugging and profiling of Grrr code, but recently it has been extended {{for the purpose of}} teaching algorithms to undergraduate students. The animation is restricted to graph based algorithms such as graph <b>drawing,</b> <b>list</b> manipulation or more traditional graph theory. The visual nature of the Grrr system allows much animation to be gained for free, with no extra user effort beyond the coding of the algorithm, but we also discuss user defined anima-tions, where custom algorithm visualisations can be explicitly defined for teaching and demonstration purposes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to list the Characterization equipment drawings that are classified as Essential Drawings and Support Drawings. Essential Drawings: Are those drawings identified by the facility staff as necessary to directly support the safe operation of the facility or equipment (HNF 1997 a). Support Drawings: Are those drawings identified by facility staff that further describe the design details of structures, systems, or components shown on essential drawings. (HNF 1997 a) The Characterization equipment drawings identified in this report are deemed essential drawings as defined in HNF-PRO- 242, Engineering Drawing Requirements (HNF 1997 a). These drawings will be prepared, revised, and maintained per HNF-PRO- 440, Engineering Document Change Control (HNF 1997 b). All other Characterization equipment drawings not identified in this document will be considered General drawings until the Characterization Equipment Drawing Evaluation Report (Wilson 1998) is updated during fiscal year 1999. Trucks 1 and 2 drawings {{are not included in}} this revision of the essential <b>drawing</b> <b>list</b> due to uncertainty about future use...|$|E

This plan applies to the W- 211 system software developed by the project, consisting of the computer human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable logic controller (PLC) software source and executable code, for production use by the waste tank operations contractor. The plan encompasses {{that portion of the}} W- 211 RCS software represented on project-specific AUTOCAD drawings that are released as part of the C 1 definitive design package (these drawings are identified on the <b>drawing</b> <b>list</b> associated with each C- 1 package), and the associated software code. Implementation of the plan is required for formal acceptance testing and production release. The software configuration management plan does not apply to reports and data generated by the software except where specifically identified.

The first machine beaded computer-assisted has been constructed by Wilcom in 1980. After 1990, developments in microprocessors allowed that all types of mechanical machines beaded to turn to digital machines beaded. These machines use digital designs. Developments in digital beaded machines allowed customization industrial products made in series. The raw material that is most important is a digital <b>drawing.</b> <b>List</b> of most important brands is high. Taking into account the number of large editors for embroidery {{it is almost impossible}} for a designer to know CAD design for all text editors. This is a problem both for designers but also for producers. A practical solution for designers is CorelDrawings what offers the convenience of design specific vector graphic-designers. Automatic conversion of the vector, the library with textures, simulate embroideries and save specific formats great brands make CorelDrawings a practical alternative. Designer can focus on specific problems without using a large number of editors for each brand. We approached a drawing of the logo to demonstrate practical capabilities. Drawing digital was saved in a format and open industrial professional editor Wilcom Designer.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of client's demand together with ever increasing {{complexity of}} building {{and in particular}} technology development has resulted in specialization of the construction industry. These demand and changes has also altered the requirement which a project manager must possess ie experience, resources and specialist support. In order for a project manager {{to meet the objectives}} set out ie time, cost and quality, he or she has to possess the relevant requirements in order to manage the highly complex and demanding project. The way and procedure in which building plans are distributed and tracked amongst consultants and contractors is one area which needed to be improved in order to meet up with the technological development. Bar code system was identified as one of the tool to improve the tracking of drawing as it has been proven to be successful in improving the asset and inventory management in construction related and non-construction related industries. The three objectives for the research into using bar code system to track drawing are: 1. To survey the standards <b>drawing</b> <b>list.</b> 2. To identify the type of bar code that is suitable for use in this project. 3. To prepare concept plan and carry out trial. The methodologies used in this research are: 1. Data collection 2. Case study 3. Field visit 4. Conduct scale down trial 5. Seek specialist advice. Researches were carried out on the three objectives and a concept plan for the bar code system was formulated. The concept plan was implemented using free demonstration software downloaded from the internet. Site visit and consultation with specialist in bar code was carried out to supplement the implementation plan. Through research and implementation of the concept, we concluded {{that it is possible to}} keep track of drawing using bar code. This system gives valuable improvement in time, cost and quality. If full scale implementation is carried out, the system can be fine tuned and even improved to include distribution of drawing or plans via the internet...|$|E

Study Program Civil Engineering, Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. The {{rapid advance}} of {{technology}} and the competition of contractors in Indonesia to win a tender. Many ways undertaken to increase {{the quality and quantity}} work, in order to creating a thrilling work for efficiently terms of the cost and time work but there are still maintain a good quality. One of them is by modifying scaffolding. Scaffolding is a pivotal component in bekisting work to support the next work. The purpose of this research is to know factors affecting the scaffolding used and to analyze comparison the scaffolding used. The data used consisting of primary and secondary data, the primary data was obtained of direct observation in the field, interviews by a team of experts, quisioner result by respondents, shop <b>drawing,</b> <b>list</b> of the rental price and the price of materials and tenga wage work. The comparative analysis was by qualitative analysis covering the criteria of productivity and duration work, cost, a method of implementation, occupational safety, mobilization, access, location and storage place, resistance of a material to weather as well as quality and quality and the qualitative analysis covering the sub criteria labor, duration work, the total cost of rent and the investment material. The result of this analysis mixed help by experts choice software. The secondary data are literature relating to work bekisting using scaffold steel from engineering analysis to analyze costs and the internet. The result of analysis from the combined of expert choice program that’s a modified scaffolding obtain weight is 0, 641 while a conventional scaffolding obtain weight is 0, 359 with the value inconsistency 0, 02. So, the modified scaffolding is better to use on the case study project because the weightings of results that has been obtained from data processing calculation, direct observation, interview with the project team and the result of quisioner by the expert team is higher than convetional scaffolding.
