It helps in the data aggregation transversely from assorted order capture and order fulfillment systems and delivers an all-inclusive platform for customer order management. It has been in vast application in the recent times, due to its advanced and precise order information efficiency and low order fulfillment costs, thus aggregating lesser manual process, and faster output. Its radical <b>exception</b> <b>response</b> based functioning and proactive monitoring enables it to centralize order data in accurate manner with ease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{language}} for programming systems with Communicating Process Architecture [1] is introduced which builds upon {{the success of}} occam [2]. Some of the principal objectives are presented and justified. The means employed to express behaviour are then described, including a transfer primitive, which conveys object ownership as well as value [3], and an alternation 1 construct. The latter replaces PRI PAR and PRI ALT, and affords explicit expression of conflict-free prioritized reactive (event-driven) behaviour, including <b>exception</b> <b>response</b> [4]. HPL also offers source-code modularity, object encapsulation, and the recursive definition of both object and process. Despite such ambition, a primary aim has been to retain simplicity in abstraction, expression, and implementation. ...|$|E

This article aims {{to investigate the}} applicability of dynamic trees in sensitivity analysis, in particular on high dimensional problems at low sample size, {{to see whether they}} can be applied to dimensionalities usually out of the range of surrogate models. Comparisons are made with Gaussian processes, as well as three measures based on a radial sampling scheme: the Monte Carlo estimator of the total sensitivity index, an elementary effects measure, and a derivative-based sensitivity measure.

40|$|Assessment of the {{response}} to treatment of metastases is crucial in daily oncological practice and clinical trials. For soft tissue metastases, this is done using computed tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using validated response evaluation criteria. Bone metastases, which frequently represent the only site of metastases, are an <b>exception</b> in <b>response</b> assessment systems, {{because of the nature}} of the fixed bony defects, their complexity, which ranges from sclerotic to osteolytic and because of the lack of sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution of the previously available bone imaging methods, mainly bone scintigraphy.

This paper highlights the most recent developments of MRI and PET, showing how they enable early detection of bone lesions and monitoring of their response.

40|$|Abstract: This {{overview}} {{describes the}} nature of the immune responses induced by the inhalation of allergens. There is a dichotomy in that B cells have multiple mechanisms that limit the amount of immuno-globulin E (IgE) antibody production, whereas T-cell responses are large even in nonallergic subjects. With the possible <b>exception</b> of <b>responses</b> to cat allergen, however, T cells from nonallergic subjects have limited effector function of helping IgG antibody, and in house-dust mite allergy, this declines with age. Regulation by interleukin 10 (IL- 10) Yproducing cells and CD 25 + T-regulatory cells has been proposed, but critically, there is limited evidence for this, and many studies show the highest IL- 10 production by cells from allergic subjects. Recent studies have shown the importance of nonlymphoid chemokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin and IL- 27, so studying responses in situ is critical. Most sources of allergens have 1 or 2 dominant allergens, and for house-dust mite, {{it has been shown that}} people have a predictable responsiveness to highY, midY and poorYIgE-binding proteins regardless of the total size of their response. This allergen hierarchy can be used to design improved allergen preparations and to investigate how antiallergen responses are regulated...|$|R

There were other consolidations. Abbot Adam of Cleobury in 1344 traded the abbey's right to cut timber in the king's woods across the county, which was often hard to exploit because of poor communications, for 240 acres of nearby Lythwood, although the exchange cost £100 at the time and an annual rent of £3. The Black Death brought a much worse crisis. Repeated outbreaks of the plague reduced the labour force so that in 1354 Bishop Northburgh blamed the scarcity of labour for the disrepair of many buildings, although he warned the abbey to look after its investment in Lythwood. The next abbot, Henry of Alston, died after a short period of office and soon there were not even enough priests. In 1365 Abbot Nicholas Stevens and the prior of Coventry were each granted a faculty by the Pope to ordain ten to make up the numbers. Stevens {{seems to have been a}} fairly effective leader in consolidating the abbey's position.|$|R

Conventional econometric studies conclude, with rare <b>exceptions,</b> that the <b>response</b> of men's hours to increases in wages is small and negative. Yet policy-makers in many countries have argued that incentive effects are large and have set low marginal tax rates accordingly. The evidence in this paper, from a sample of more than twenty-three thousand UK male employees, suggests that, for non-unionized labour markets, the labour supply wage elasticity is considerably large than the existing literature has suggested. The UK offers and unusually valuable test-bed for male labour supply modelling because it has a simple flat rate tax across the majority of the income distribution and offers two natural experiments that circumvent the simultaneity problems that have dogged the literature. ...|$|R
