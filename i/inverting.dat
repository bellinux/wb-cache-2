5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after <b>inverting</b> the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses <b>inverting</b> images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger posits that Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's {{grappling with the}} desire for revenge and the tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced the rape of Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's rape of an Aryan woman, thus completely <b>inverting</b> Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to the punishment of a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E

5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases.

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by <b>inverting</b> the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{extracellular}} {{domains of}} cytokine receptors are released during inflammation, but {{little is known}} about the shedding of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and whether they can be used as diagnostic biomarkers. MethodsThe release of sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia (n <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 11, 2 ng/kg LPS), and in plasma of 394 patients with infections (infectious mononucleosis, measles, respiratory tract infections, bacterial sepsis and candidemia) or non-infectious inflammation (Crohn <b>inverted</b> question marks disease, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes and pancreatitis). Using C-statistics, the value of sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 levels for discrimination between infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as well as between viral and bacterial infections was analyzed. ResultsIn-vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells released sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 by exposure to microbial ligands. During experimental human endotoxemia, plasma concentrations peaked after 2 hours (sTLR 4) and 4 hours (sTLR 2). sTLR 4 did not correlate with cytokines, but sTLR 2 correlated positively with TNF <b>inverted</b> question mark (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 80, P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 05), IL- 6 (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 65, P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 05), and IL- 1 Ra (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 57, P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 06), and negatively with IL- 10 (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark- 0. 58, P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 06), respectively. sTLR 4 had a similar area under the ROC curve [AUC] for differentiating infectious and non-infectious inflammation compared to CRP: 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 66 - 0. 79) versus 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 80) [P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 80], while sTLR 2 had a lower AUC: 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 66) [P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 0004]. CRP differentiated bacterial infections better from viral infections than sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 : AUC 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 96) versus 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 51 - 0. 64) and 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 70 - 0. 80), respectively [P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 0001 for both].

5|$|One of {{the first}} known {{experiments}} {{on the relationship between}} combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd centuryBCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that <b>inverting</b> a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for <b>inverting</b> to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> duplications are {{a common}} type of copy number {{variation}} (CNV) in germline and somatic genomes. Large duplications that include many genes can lead to both neurodevelopmental phenotypes in children and gene amplifications in tumors. There are several models for <b>inverted</b> duplication formation, most of which include a dicentric chromosome intermediate followed by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, but the mechanisms {{that give rise to}} the <b>inverted</b> dicentric chromosome in most <b>inverted</b> duplications remain unknown. Here we have combined high-resolution array CGH, custom sequence capture, next-generation sequencing, and long-range PCR to analyze the breakpoints of 50 nonrecurrent <b>inverted</b> duplications in patients with intellectual disability, autism, and congenital anomalies. For half of the rearrangements in our study, we sequenced at least one breakpoint junction. Sequence analysis of breakpoint junctions reveals a normal-copy disomic spacer between <b>inverted</b> and non-inverted copies of the duplication. Further, short <b>inverted</b> sequences are present at the boundary of the disomic spacer and the <b>inverted</b> duplication. These data support a mechanism of <b>inverted</b> duplication formation whereby a chromosome with a double-strand break intrastrand pairs with itself to form a "fold-back" intermediate that, after DNA replication, produces a dicentric <b>inverted</b> chromosome with a disomic spacer corresponding {{to the site of the}} fold-back loop.

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> repeats are {{important}} genetic elements for genome instability. In {{the current study}} we have investigated the role of <b>inverted</b> repeats in a DNA rearrangement reaction using a linear DNA substrate. We show that linear DNA substrates with terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats can efficiently transform Escherichia coli. The transformation products contain circular <b>inverted</b> dimers in which the DNA sequences between terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats are duplicated. In contrast to the recombination/rearrangement product of circular DNA substrates, which is exclusively one particular form of the <b>inverted</b> dimer, the rearrangement products of the linear DNA substrate consist of two isomeric forms of the <b>inverted</b> dimer. Escherichia coli mutants defective in RecBCD exhibit much reduced transformation efficiency, suggesting a role for RecBCD in the protection rather than destruction of these linear DNA substrates. These results suggest a model in which <b>inverted</b> repeats near the ends of a double-strand break can be processed by a helicase/exonuclease to form hairpin caps. Processing of hairpin capped DNA intermediates can then yield <b>inverted</b> duplications. Linear DNA substrates containing terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats can also be converted into <b>inverted</b> dimers in COS cells, suggesting conservation {{of this type of}} genome instability from bacteria to mammalian cells...|$|R
