40|$|We {{investigate}} the communication sequences {{of millions of}} people through two different channels and analyse the fine grained temporal structure of correlated event trains induced by single individuals. By focusing on correlations between the heterogeneous dynamics and the topology of egocentric networks we find that the bursty trains usually evolve for pairs of individuals rather than for the ego and his/her several neighbours, thus burstiness is a property of the links rather than of the nodes. We compare the <b>directional</b> <b>balance</b> of calls and short messages within bursty trains to the average on the actual link and show that for the trains of voice calls the imbalance is significantly enhanced, while for short messages the balance within the trains increases. These effects can be partly traced back to the technological constraints (for short messages) and partly to the human behavioural features (voice calls). We define a model that is able to reproduce the empirical results and may help us to understand better the mechanisms driving technology mediated human communication dynamics. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|With seismic {{interferometry}} or {{the virtual}} source method, controlled sources can be redatumed from the Earth’s surface to generate so-called virtual sources at downhole receiver locations. Generally {{this is done}} by crosscorrelation of the recorded down-hole data and stacking over source locations. By studying the retrieved data at zero time lag, downhole illumination conditions that determine the virtual source radi- ation pattern can be analyzed without a velocity model. This can be beneficial for survey planning in time-lapse experiments. Moreover, the virtual source radiation pattern can be corrected by multidimensional deconvolution or <b>directional</b> <b>balancing.</b> Such an approach can help to improve virtual source repeatability, posing major advantages for reservoir monitoring.

The aim of this experimentation was to compare impact resistance and to characterise damage patterns of different laminates, in order to provide indications for their use in components. Two E-glass/polypropylene composites, commingled ®Twintex (with three different weave structures: <b>directional,</b> <b>balanced</b> and 3 -D) and random reinforced GMT, were in particular characterised. <b>Directional</b> and <b>balanced</b> Twintex were also coupled in a number of hybrid configurations with GMT to evaluate the possible use of GMT/Twintex hybrids in high-energy absorption components. The laminates were impacted using a falling weight tower, with impact energies ranging from 15 [*]J to penetration. Using IR thermography during cooling down following a long pulse (3 [*]s), impact damaged areas were characterised and the influence of weave structure on damage patterns was studied. IR thermography offered good accuracy for laminates with thickness not exceeding 3. 5 [*]mm: this appears to be a limit for the direct use of this method on components, where more refined signal treatment would probably be needed for impact damage characterisation...|$|R

Recent functional studies have revealed mosquito genes that are crucial for Plasmodium development, but there is presently little understanding of which genes mediate vector competence in the wild, or evolve in response to parasite-mediated selection. Here, we use population genetic approaches to study the strength and mode of natural selection on a suite of mosquito immune system genes, CTL 4, CTLMA 2, LRIM 1, and APL 2 (LRRD 7), which {{have been shown to}} affect Plasmodium development in functional studies. We sampled these genes from two African populations of An. gambiae s. s., along with several closely related species, and conclude that there is no evidence for either strong <b>directional</b> or <b>balancing</b> selection on these genes.

We assess genetic variation of C. alternans, genetic exchange, differentiation, bottlenecks, effective population size and signals of natural selection. Genetic diversity was higher in conserved than in fragmented forest but not significant. Fragmentation did not {{play a significant role}} in genetic diversity, possibly due to the populations heterogeneity. C. alternans has been subject to a pronounced isolation of trees as a product of logging, thus raising inbreeding. Bayesian clustering show a trend towards an increased structuring over the course of generations but also, indicates that populations have recently gone through a bottleneck. The bottleneck following deforestation was not severe enough to lower the effective size, this could lead to high standing genetic diversity, providing a buffer against genetic erosion. We observed <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection in C. alternans.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding which {{parts of}} the genome have been most {{influenced}} by adaptive evolution remains an unsolved puzzle. Some evidence suggests that selection has {{the greatest impact on}} regions of the genome that interact with other evolving genomes, including loci that are involved in host-parasite co-evolutionary processes. In this study, we used a population genetic approach to test this hypothesis by comparing DNA sequences of 30 putative immune system genes in the crustacean Daphnia pulex with 24 non-immune system genes. Results In support of the hypothesis, results from a multilocus extension of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test indicate that immune system genes as a class have experienced more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes. However, not all immune system genes show evidence of adaptive evolution. Additionally, we apply single locus MK tests and calculate population genetic parameters at all loci in order to characterize the mode of selection (<b>directional</b> versus <b>balancing)</b> in the genes that show the greatest deviation from neutral evolution. Conclusions Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that immune system genes undergo more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes, possibly as a result of host-parasite arms races. The results of these analyses highlight several candidate loci undergoing adaptive evolution that could be targeted in future studies. </p...|$|R

Within {{population}} diversity {{was estimated}} by computing haplotype diversity (H) and nucleotide diversity (π) indices using DnaSP v 5.10 (Librado and Rozas 2009) and Arlequin v 3.5. 1.2 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Hierarchical {{relationships among the}} populations were analyzed using AMOVA and genetic variance was partitioned using Fst. The phylogenetic analysis included finding the best substitution model in Modeltest 2.1. 1 (Darriba et al. 2012) using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Baysian Information Criterion (BIC). The haplotype network was computed using Network v 4.6. 1.1 (Bandelt et al. 1999) where the haplotype pairwise differences {{were used to determine}} the number of mutational steps between haplotypes. A statistical test initially developed to analyze selective neutrality of mutations was implemented to test demographic expansion in recent years (de Jong et al. 2011; Ramos-Onsins and Rozas 2002). As shown by de Jong et al. (2011), these tests are designed to distinguish between neutrally evolving sequences in mutation drift equilibrium and sequences evolving under non-neutral processes including <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection and demographic expansion or population contraction. These tests were performed in Arlequin v 3.1 using 1000 simulations under a selective model of neutrality.

Four DNA sequences were analysed—mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b), nuclear elongation factor- 1 α (EF- 1 α) and two anonymous nuclear loci—for 14 – 15 French populations and single populations from northeast Spain, northwest Spain, Portugal and Morocco. The presence of cryptic sibling species was not revealed by phylogenetic analyses and testing for reproductive isolation between sympatric populations defined by the two most divergent cyt b haplogroups. No locus was shown to be under positive <b>directional</b> or <b>balancing</b> selection and, therefore, molecular variation was explained demographically. Each nuclear locus showed shallow isolation by distance from Portugal to the French Pyrenees, but for both cyt b and EF- 1 α there was then a step change to the upland Massif Central, where leading-edge populations showed low diversity at all loci. Multiple genetic divergences and population expansions were detected by analyses of cyt b and dated to the Pleistocene. Endemicity of one cyt b sub-lineage suggested the presence of a refuge north of the Pyrenees during the last glacial period. Monopolization of the Massif Central by genetically differentiated populations of P. ariasi might possibly hinder the northwards spread of leishmaniasis...|$|R

Overall the directional ratio showed weak correlation with the damping ratio (r = - 0. 05) and the time of balance regain (r = - 0. 08), suggesting new information content. One-legged stances had significantly lower damping ratio (p = 0. 013) and directional ratio values (p < 0. 00), showing more anterior-posterior movement and elliptical trajectories.

The purpose of the test is to distinguish between a DNA sequence evolving randomly ("neutrally") and one evolving under a non-random process, including <b>directional</b> selection or <b>balancing</b> selection, demographic expansion or contraction, genetic hitchhiking, or introgression. A randomly evolving DNA sequence contains mutations with {{no effect on the}} fitness and survival of an organism. The randomly evolving mutations are called [...] "neutral", while mutations under selection are [...] "non-neutral". For example, you would expect to find that a mutation which causes prenatal death or severe disease to be under selection. When looking at the human population as a whole, we say that the population frequency of a neutral mutation fluctuates randomly (i.e. the percentage of people in the population with the mutation changes {{from one generation to the}} next, and this percentage is equally likely to go up or down) through genetic drift.|$|R

This complexity {{provides the}} opportunity to evaluate the ecological and social conditions that favor the evolution of complex signaling. We investigated how the chemical signatures of three populations of the social paper wasp Polistes biglumis differed in terms of concentration of hydrocarbons, proportions of branched hydrocarbons and overall variation. We tested whether the variation in chemical signatures among populations {{could be explained by}} the prevalence of social parasites or whether this was just an effect of local abiotic conditions which influenced the composition of the hydrocarbon cuticular layer. We studied the chemical signa-ture in three populations in which obligate social parasites differed in the selection pressures they imposed on host populations. Within each population, we restricted our analyses to non-parasitized hosts, to avoid potential short-term effects of parasite pres-ence on the host chemical signatures. We found that host colonies in parasitized populations had more diverse profiles than the parasite-free population. Moreover, the overall concentration of hydrocarbons and the relative proportion of branched hydrocar-bons were larger in the parasitized populations, relative to the non-parasitized one. This is to our knowledge the first evidence in favour of the hypothesis that different traits in the host chemical signatures as a whole undergo evolutionary changes resulting from <b>directional</b> or <b>balancing</b> selection imposed by social parasites. We conclude that obligate social parasites act as 'engines of diversity' on host chemical signatures and operate in favor of a geographic mosaic of diverging communication codes [Current Zoology 60 (1) : 137  148, 2014]...|$|R

In this context, freshwater systems are likely among those that have been most impacted by pollution. The Maipo River {{is one of the}} most polluted basins in Chile, surrounded by 40 % of the human population of the country. There are five populations of the endemic silverside Basilichthys microlepidotus inhabiting this river, two in polluted areas and three in non-polluted areas. The goal of this study was to identify candidate loci or loci potentially under <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection related to pollution in B. microlepidotus. To this end, a genome scan (AFLP markers) was performed, comparing between fish located in polluted and non-polluted areas and between fish inhabiting polluted sites.

40|$|The highly diverse {{genes of}} the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) are important in the adaptive immune system {{and are expected to}} be under selection from pathogens. Thus, the MHC genes provide an exceptional opportunity to investigate patterns of selection within and across populations. In this study, we analyzed genetic variation at the MHC class IIB gene and six microsatellite loci across 10 populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in the northern range of Trinidad. We found a high level of diversity at the MHC, with a total of 43 alleles in 142 individuals. At the population level, we found that neutral evolution could not fully account for the variability found at the MHC. Instead, we found that MHC FST statistics were lower than FST derived from the microsatellite loci; 33 of 45 population pairwise estimates for the MHC were significantly lower than those for the microsatellite loci, and MHC FST estimates were consistently lower than those predicted by a coalescent model of neutral evolution. These results suggest a similar selection acting across populations, and we discuss the potential roles of <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection. At the sequence level, we found evidence for both positive and purifying selection. Furthermore, positive selection was detected within and adjacent to the putative peptide-binding region (PBR) of the MHC. Surprisingly, we also found a purifying selection at two sites within the putative PBR. Overall, our data provide evidence for selection for functional diversity at the MHC class IIB gene at both the population and nucleotide levels of guppy populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{major effort}} is {{underway}} to use population genetic approaches to identify loci involved in adaptation. One {{issue that has}} so far received limited attention is whether loci that show a phylogenetic signal of positive selection in the past also show evidence of ongoing positive selection at the population level. We address this issue using vomeronasal receptors (VRs), a diverse gene family in mammals involved in intraspecific communication and predator detection. In mouse lemurs, we previously demonstrated that both subfamilies of VRs (V 1 Rs and V 2 Rs) show a strong signal of directional selection in interspecific analyses. We predicted that ongoing sexual selection and/or co-evolution with predators may lead to current <b>directional</b> or <b>balancing</b> selection on VRs. Here, we re-sequence 17 VRs and perform a suite of selection and demographic analyses in sympatric populations of two species of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) in northwestern Madagascar. Results M. ravelobensis had consistently higher genetic diversity at VRs than M. murinus. In general, we find little evidence for positive selection, with most loci evolving under purifying selection and one locus even showing evidence of functional loss in M. ravelobensis. However, a few loci in M. ravelobensis show potential evidence of positive selection. Using mismatch distributions and expansion models, we infer a more recent colonisation of the habitat by M. murinus than by M. ravelobensis, which most likely speciated in this region earlier on. Conclusions These {{findings suggest that the}} analysis of VR variation is useful in inferring demographic and phylogeographic history of mouse lemurs. In conclusion, this study reveals a substantial heterogeneity over time in selection on VR loci, suggesting that VR evolution is episodic...|$|R
40|$|Early 1950 s {{models of}} nuclei {{considered}} {{that they were}} made up solely of protons and neutrons having approximately equal sizes. A large nucleus was an approximately spherical ensemble made up of these packed entities. Nuclear reactions were treated using Quantum Mechanics, by solving the Schrödinger wave equation for wave amplitudes inside and outside a nucleus and relating these to cross sections. Beginning in the 1990 s, new Classical Electromagnetic models of nuclei were developed. These were quite totally different {{from those in the}} theoretical Standard Model which uses quarks and gluons, etc. Electrons and protons were considered to be spinning charged fibers, and a neutron was considered to be a paired combination of an electron and a proton. With these new nucleon models, nuclei were crudely modeled as concentric shells of these particles placed in a 3 D spatial configuration by a geometrical mapping theory called Combinatorial Geometry. This theory was able to correctly predict the “Magic Numbers ” as combinations of shells filling and emptying as nucleons were added. An improved Semi-Empirical Binding Energy Formula was developed, that accurately predicts the binding energies of stable and radioactive isotopes, and also correctly predicts their spins. The Electromagnetic model was improved by making detailed spatial and <b>directional</b> force <b>balances</b> using a variational minimization technique, which predicts decay energies for various reactions. In 2004, a new Electromagnetic model of all types of particles was developed based upon a three-level scheme of wrapping 1 / 3 fractionally charged fibers. This new fiber model has yet to be used to redo the nucleus calculations. However, Electromagnetic models have the potential to describe nuclear reactions in terms of unstable vibrations whose equations are analogs to the Schrödinger equation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss all of these models, and to predict where the research should go next...|$|R
30|$|The {{definition}} {{used for}} rail {{capacity in the}} literature varies based on the techniques and objectives of the specific study. For instance, Barkan and Lai [3] defined capacity as “a measure {{of the ability to}} move a specific amount of traffic over a defined rail corridor in the U.S. rail environment with a given set of resources under a specific service plan, known as level of service (LOS)”. They listed several infrastructure and operational characteristics which affect capacity levels, including length of subdivision, siding length and spacing, intermediate signal spacing, percentage of number of tracks (single, double, and multi-tracks), and heterogeneity in train types (train length, power-to-weight ratios). In another paper, Tolliver [4] introduced freight rail capacity as the number of trains per day for typical track configurations depending on several factors, such as track segment length, train speed, signal aspects and signal block length, <b>directional</b> traffic <b>balance,</b> and peaking characteristics. The American Railroad Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) offers a simplified approach for line capacity that estimates practical capacity by multiplying theoretical capacity (C t) and dispatching efficiency (E) of the line (C = C t × E). AREMA’s method for calculating theoretical capacity and dispatching efficiency requires consideration of various factors, such as number of tracks, the operations rules (single or bi-direction operation), stopping distance between trains (or headway), alignment specifications (grade, curves, sidings, etc.), trains specifications (type of train, length, weight, etc.), maintenance activities requirements, and the signaling and train control systems [5]. A capacity modeling guidebook for the U.S. shared-use corridors, released by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), defines capacity as “the capability of a given set of facilities, along with their related management and support systems, to deliver acceptable levels of service for each category of use.” Similar to the other capacity definitions, TRB notes that different parameters and variables should be considered in the capacity analysis, such as train dispatching patterns, train type and consist, signaling system, infrastructure, track maintenance system, etc. [6].|$|R

The industry is almost exclusively dependant on wild oysters for which there are currently no comprehensive management guidelines, as a country-wide genetic stock assessment has not been undertaken. Therefore no information {{is available on the}} number of discrete populations present, their levels of genetic fitness, or if domestic translocation of animals is suitable for the establishment of new farms. Consequently, there is a compelling need for genetic resources to resolve these knowledge gaps and inform policy for the sustainable development of the industry. SNPs are a powerful and highly versatile genetic tool for species management, and were selected here as their genome-wide presence and availability in large numbers provide the detection power required to discover fine-scale levels of population stratification, make assessments of locally adaptive variation and permit association analyses for future selective breeding efforts. The utility and power of 6, 753 genome-wide SNP loci were investigated to describe the population structure, diversity and connectivity in four Fijian oyster populations discovered using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). The global Fst value was 0. 0425, while population pairwise values ranged between 0. 0015 - 0. 0825 (p< 0. 05), indicating very little differentiation that is similar to patterns identified for other marine species which experience high levels of gene flow over large spatial scales. The markers described here will also be useful for independent Fst outlier detection for investigations of <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection, to evaluate any population-specific local adaptations. Overall, these SNPs provide {{for the first time the}} ability to examine fine-scale patterns of genetic structure, adaptive variation and genome-wide association in this commercially important marine mollusc, all of which are requisite for effective and comprehensive stock management. They are also excellent candidates for future research, and highly useful for further population assignment, translocation management and genetic monitoring of the Black-lip Pearl Oyster resource in the Fiji Islands...|$|R

In addition, a HIV- 1 population may adapt through frequency changes of its variants. To reveal such population dynamics we analyzed HIV- 1 subpopulation frequencies in an untreated patient with stable, low plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels and close to normal CD 4 + T-cell levels. The patient was intensively sampled during a 32 -day period as well as approximately 1. 5 years before and after this period (days - 664, 1, 2, 3, 11, 18, 25, 32 and 522). 77 sequences of HIV- 1 env (approximately 3100 nucleotides) were obtained from plasma by limiting dilution with 7 - 11 sequences per time point, except day - 664. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood methods showed that the sequences clustered in six distinct subpopulations. We devised a method that took into account the relatively coarse sampling of the population. Data from days 1 through 32 were consistent with constant within-patient subpopulation frequencies. However, over longer time periods, i. e. between days 1 [...] . 32 and 522, there were significant changes in subpopulation frequencies, which were consistent with evolutionarily neutral fluctuations. We found no clear signal of natural selection within the subpopulations over the study period, but positive selection was evident on the long branches that connected the subpopulations, which corresponds to > 3 years as the subpopulations already were established when we started the study. Thus, selective forces {{may have been involved}} when the subpopulations were established. Genetic drift within subpopulations caused by de novo substitutions could be resolved after approximately one month. Overall, we conclude that subpopulation frequencies within this patient changed significantly over a time period of 1. 5 years, but that this does not imply <b>directional</b> or <b>balancing</b> selection. We show that the short-term evolution we study here is likely representative for many patients of slow and normal disease progression...|$|R

Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 P. falciparum clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3 D 7 P. falciparum reference genome sequence, and data on 136, 144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained.

Sequence diversity was four times greater in S. enterica than in E. coli, {{and in both}} species the rate of amino acid substitution was lower in the NAD(+) -binding domain than in the catalytic domain. Divergence of the mdh genes of the two species apparently has not involved excess nonsynonymous substitutions resulting from the fixation of adaptive amino acid mutations. Allozyme analysis detected 57 % of the distinctive amino acid sequences. Statistical tests {{of the distribution of}} polymorphic synonymous nucleotide sites identified four possible intragenic recombination events, one involving a single allele of E. coli and three involving alleles of the three subspecies of S. enterica. But recombination at mdh has not occurred with sufficient frequency to obscure the phylogenetic relationships among strains indicated by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, total DNA hybridization, and sequence analysis of the gapA and putP genes. These findings provide further evidence that the effective (realized) rates of horizontal transfer and recombination for metabolic enzyme and other housekeeping genes are generally low in these species, in contrast to those for loci encoding or mediating the structure of cell-surface and other macromolecules for which recombinants may be subject to strong <b>balancing,</b> <b>directional,</b> or diversifying selection...|$|R

Bidirectional counting data of free people flow was collected for 36 days in one-hour resolution, including five hours of manual counting. Compared to the manual results, one of the light beam sensors had the most equally <b>balanced</b> <b>directional</b> overall counting errors (4. 6 % and 5. 2 %). The collected data of this sensor was used to model the air transportation energy consumption of visitor counting sensor-based DCV and constant air volume ventilation (CAV). The results suggest that potential savings in air transportation energy consumption could be gained with the modeled DCV as its total daily airflow during the test period was 54 % of the total daily airflow of the modeled CAV on average. A virtually real-time control of ventilation could be realized with minute-level counting resolution. Site-specific calibration of the visitor counting sensors is advisable and they could be complemented with presence detectors to avoid unnecessary ventilation during unoccupied periods of the room. A combination of CO 2 and visitor counting sensors could be exploited in DCV to always guarantee sufficient ventilation with a short response time...|$|R

In order to reveal signatures of selection in loci with a bearing on skin pigmentation in humans, we have resequenced between 4 to 5 kb of the proximal regulatory regions of three of the most differently expressed genes, in the expectation that variation at regulatory regions might account for intraespecific morphological diversity, as suggested elsewhere. Results Contrary to our expectations, expression profiles did not cluster the cells into unirradiated versus irradiated melanocytes, or into lightly pigmented versus darkly pigmented melanocytes. Instead, expression profiles correlated with the presence of Bovine Pituitary Extract (known to contain α-MSH) in the media. This allowed us to differentiate between melanocytes that are synthesizing melanin and those that are not. TYR, TYRP 1 and DCT were among the five most differently expressed genes between these two groups. Population genetic analyses of sequence haplotypes of the proximal regulatory flanking-regions included Tajima's D, HEW and DHEW neutrality tests analysis. These were complemented with EHH tests (among others) in which the significance was obtained by a novel approach using extensive simulations under the coalescent model with recombination. We observe strong evidence for positive selection for TYRP 1 alleles in Africans and for DCT and TYRP 1 in Asians. However, the overall picture reflects a complex pattern of selection, which might include overdominance for DCT in Europeans. Conclusion Diversity patterns clearly evidence adaptive selection in pigmentation genes in Africans and Asians. In Europeans, the evidence is more complex, and both <b>directional</b> and <b>balancing</b> selection may be involved in light skin. As a result, different non-African populations may have acquired light skin by alternative ways, and so light skin, and perhaps dark skin too, {{may be the result of}} convergent evolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Earlier {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that static postural control is worse in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), whereas little information is available about the dynamic balance and impact of OA on functional mobility. Purposes: The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether balance as assessed by static postural control under different test conditions and dynamic standing are impaired in subjects with knee OA. Secondary purpose was to investigate whether functional mobility is impaired in subjects with knee OA compared with age, gender and body mass index (BM!) matched control group. Finally, investigate the correlation between pain, physical function and postural stability, functional mobility. Methods: Thirty female subjects with knee OA and 30 normal control females participated in this study, modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance (mCTS!B),limit of stability (LOS), step up/over (SUO) and sit to stand (STS) tests were assessed by Balance Master System. Results: Compared with age, gender and BM! Control group, the patients with knee OA had statistical sign(ficant greater sway under different test conditions except under firm condition with eye opened (P= 0. 29). There were statistical significant reductions in directional control, movement velocity and increase in reaction time (P=O. OOOl). Regarding variables of suo there were statistical significant increases in exerted force and time required to get up and over stair. In addition there were statistical significant differences in weight transfer, sway velocity and rising index (P= 0. 033, 0. 018 and 0. 027) respectively. Finally negative correlation (r=-. 479) was found only between pain and ability of patients to progress toward target. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggested that older women with knee OA present worse performance in functional mobility and require a longer period of time and exert more force and less <b>directional</b> control during <b>balance</b> tests when compared with age, gender and BMI matched controls...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					 					Allorecognition, {{the ability}} of an {{organism}} to distinguish self from non-self, occurs throughout the entire tree of life. Despite the prevalence and importance of allorecognition systems, the genetic basis of allorecognition has rarely been characterized outside the well-known MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) in vertebrates and SI (Self-Incompatibility) in plants. Where loci have been identified, their evolutionary history is an open question. We have previously identified the genes involved in self/non-self recognition in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, and we can now begin to investigate their evolution. In B. schlosseri, colonies sharing 1 or more alleles of a gene called FuHC (Fusion Histocompatibility) will fuse. Protein products of a locus called fester, located ~ 300 kb from FuHC, {{have been shown to}} play multiple roles in the histocompatibility reaction, as activating and/or inhibitory receptors. We test whether the proteins encoded by this locus are evolving neutrally or are experiencing <b>balancing,</b> <b>directional,</b> or purifying selection. 				 				 					 						Results 					 					Nearly all of the variation in the fester locus resides within populations. The 13 housekeeping genes (12 nuclear genes and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I) have substantially more structure among populations within groups and among groups than fester. All polymorphism statistics (Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F*) are significantly negative for the East Coast A-type alleles, and Fu and Li's F* statistic is significantly negative for the West Coast A-type alleles. These results are likely due to selection rather than demography, given that 10 of the housekeeping loci have no populations with significant values for any of the polymorphism statistics.
