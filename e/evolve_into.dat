5|$|Another Charizard {{appears in}} Pokémon X and Y, under the {{ownership}} of Alain. This Charizard can Mega <b>Evolve</b> <b>into</b> Mega Charizard X and has shown to be powerful by defeating 10 Mega Evolutions {{in a row and}} defeating Ash's Greninja, who had a type advantage. It also defeated Trevor's Charizard, who can easily Mega <b>Evolve</b> <b>into</b> Mega Charizard Y.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that LARP may one day <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a major {{industry}} {{in the form of}} location-based games using ubiquitous computing.|$|E
50|$|Cretolamna is {{believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the genus Otodus sometime in the Paleocene. Otodus {{is believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> later <b>into</b> the Carcharocles genus. Others believe that Cretolamna <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Paleocene shark Palaeocarcharodon, which some think <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R
50|$|In some dialects vowels {{interrupted}} by stop have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> individual phonemes themselves, {{for example in}} Todos Santos dialect/oʔ/ represented by o' has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> /ɵʏˀ/ and /oʔo/ represented by o'o has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> /ɵ'ʉ/.|$|R
50|$|Later, multi-effects type <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> {{modeling}} guitar, and {{the other}} two types <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> current guitar-synthesizers.|$|R
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main sequence until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
50|$|These two results {{provided}} two competing systems for study {{of behavior and}} <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> ethology and further <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> comparative psychology.|$|R
5000|$|For [...] "Pro" [...] racing {{with the}} NHRA, Nostalgia Super Stock <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Pro Stock and FX <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Funny Car.|$|R
50|$|By the 19th century, coursed strings where <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> 6 single-stringed {{instruments}} {{much like}} that of the guitar today. It had <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the modern look except for size, retaining a smaller frame.|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} funnel clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} funnel clouds <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|E
5|$|When powdery, snow drifts {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|Daltrey, {{who was in}} {{the year}} above, had moved to Acton from Shepherd's Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and {{discovered}} gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{precursor}} of {{the so called}} [...] "packet communication" [...] that eventually <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> today's TCP/IP technology. SDLC itself <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> HDLC, one of the base technologies for dedicated telecommunication circuits.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th century, the whitedish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a meatless dessert pudding {{with cream}} and eggs and, later, gelatin. In the 19th century, {{arrowroot}} and cornflour were added and the dish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the modern blancmange.|$|R
50|$|Several of the {{facilities}} <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> hospitals or medical facilities: Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Penrose Hospital. Beth-El Hospital, with the National Deaconess Sanitarium, <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Memorial Hospital. St. Francis Hospital was a hospital that had a sanatorium in its three building complex. Union Printers Home and the Modern Woodmen Tuberculosis Sanatorium, now Mount Saint Francis, are going concerns with skilled nursing care. Today, however, the structure's usages are different. Miramont Castle, which {{was the site of}} the Montcalm Sanitarium, is now a museum. National Methodist Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a building for the Ent Air Force Base and its site is now part of the United States Olympic Training Center.|$|R
5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However, {{in the time it}} will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat.|$|E
5|$|One branch would <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> cetaceans, {{possibly}} beginning about , {{with the}} protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, {{a large family}} of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny hippopotamuses with comparatively small and narrow heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Air Force in November 1952, who were interested enough to create a new proposal, inviting several companies to participate. Three additional designs were received: the Republic AP-55, an improved version of its prototype XF-91 Thunderceptor; the North American NA-212, which would eventually <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> the F-107; and the Northrop N-102 Fang, a new General Electric J79-powered design. Although all were interesting, Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953.|$|E
50|$|The Air Battalion Royal Engineers (ABRE) was {{the first}} flying unit of the British Armed Forces {{to make use of}} heavier-than-air craft. It <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Flying Corps which in turn <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Air Force.|$|R
50|$|As {{one species}} <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> another, its teeth may become {{difficult}} to classify, exhibiting characteristics of both species. For example, teeth from Carcharocles auriculatus as it <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> C. angustidens, {{are difficult to}} definitively identify as coming from either species.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of {{evolution}} across all Pokémon Generations, and involves Pokémon acquiring experience points through battling other Pokémon (both wild and captured). For example, Caterpie <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Metapod at level 7, and Metapod <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Butterfree at level 10.|$|R
5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{invitation}} of President William Tubman, Massaquoi returned to Liberia on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in Monrovia. She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at Liberia College, later the University of Liberia (UL). In 1956, she became director, then dean (1960), of the Liberal Arts College and was a co-founder of the Society of Liberian Authors. In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies, which would <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> the Institute of African Studies at UL.|$|E
5|$|While Hillenburg was there, {{his love}} of the ocean began to {{influence}} his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which {{was used by the}} institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools. The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> SpongeBob SquarePants characters. Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.|$|E

50|$|Diictodon was a dicynodont, and {{therefore}} only distantly {{related to the}} cynodonts that eventually <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> mammals. Some <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> larger species. These dicynodonts, such as Lystrosaurus and Placerias dominated the earlier part of the Triassic period. However, they were out-competed by prosauropod dinosaurs in the Norian.|$|R
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} debuted on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal on March 27, 2005. While creating the show, producers put {{an emphasis on}} the casting process. The series has aired for thirteen seasons, and focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns and residents, as they gradually <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. It is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which would later <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> the concept of fair use. The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, the publishers Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E
