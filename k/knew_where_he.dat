25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E

500|$|After his training, Matthews {{was first}} {{stationed}} in Fort Huachuca in Arizona. At the time, {{the army was}} still using Native Americans as guides in the western United States. During his tenure in the state, he was regarded as an excellent marksman. Next, he joined General John J. Pershing's campaign into Mexico in 1916 to hunt for Pancho Villa. Although Matthews admitted to never having met Villa, he would claim that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was at." [...] During World War I, the battlefields of Europe were not conducive to cavalry; the 10th Regiment performed duty {{on the border with}} Mexico, including skirmishes with Mexicans and their German military advisors in the vicinity of Nogales, Arizona.|$|E
500|$|He learned {{baseball}} at {{an early}} age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth. As a Little League player and just 8 years old, he moved from pitcher and third baseman(his favorite position) to catcher because his father, who was also his coach, thought he was throwing too hard and scaring opposing players with his pitches. Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that [...] "He showed leadership at 16 that I'd seen in few kids. He <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was going." [...] Rodríguez {{signed a contract with}} the Texas Rangers in July 1988, at the age of 16, and began his professional baseball career.|$|E

The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: [...] "In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage {{as close as possible to}} how I thought he wanted it." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Partridge {{was created}} for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy {{programme}} On The Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's hapless sports presenter. He is portrayed by Steve Coogan, who had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station at university. On The Hour writers Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Richard Herring and Stewart Lee wrote much of Partridge's original material, although Herring credits the creation to Coogan and Iannucci. Iannucci asked Coogan to do a voice for a generic sports reporter; according to Iannucci, [...] "Someone said, 'He's an Alan!' and someone else said, 'He's a Partridge!' Within minutes we <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived, we'd worked out his back story, what his aspirations were." [...] Coogan said Partridge was originally a [...] "one-note, sketchy character" [...] and [...] "freak show", but became [...] "more and more refined {{as sort of a}} dysfunctional alter ego" [...] over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was digest-sized, and was printed in green ink. [...] Colby {{initially}} focused on weird fiction, with Thomas P. Kelley, a Canadian writer whose work {{had appeared in}} Weird Tales, a prolific contributor. [...] For the first four issues the format remained unchanged, and almost all the stories were by Kelley or other Canadian writers. [...] Colby subsequently began to obtain reprint rights to U.S. stories from both Donald A. Wollheim and Sam Moskowitz, though Wollheim's and Moskowitz's accounts of the events differ. [...] In Wollheim's account, he happened to meet Colby early in 1941 in New York; Wollheim had been editing Cosmic Stories and Stirring Science Stories but both magazines had ceased publication {{at the time of}} the meeting. [...] Colby, who worked for a Toronto newspaper, told Wollheim that he was editing Uncanny Tales to make extra money, and asked if Wollheim <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> might be able to obtain stories at a low word rate. [...] Since Stirring and Cosmic had never been distributed in Canada, Wollheim was able to offer him Canadian rights to the stories in those magazines, and Colby agreed to pay a quarter of a cent per word. [...] According to Moskowitz, Wollheim heard rumors of the new magazine, perhaps via Nils Frome, a Canadian fan whom he knew. [...] Wollheim obtained more details from Chester Cuthbert, a Canadian author he was in correspondence with, and contacted Colby to arrange reprints of stories from Stirring and Cosmic. [...] Moskowitz had also heard of Uncanny Tales and wrote to him separately, arranging reprints at a tenth of a cent per word. [...] He sent Colby several stories, which were duly printed, but subsequent correspondence with Colby failed to elicit payment, and eventually Colby stopped responding to his letters. [...] The manuscripts were never returned. [...] A few months later, Moskowitz spoke to John B. Michel—an author associated with Wollheim's group of writers—and found out that a long-standing feud between Wollheim and Moskowitz was at least partly responsible for his problems. [...] Wollheim and many of the group of writers he represented held very left-wing political positions; Moskowitz was strongly opposed, and Michel told Moskowitz that Colby was politically left-wing and had been put off by indications from Moskowitz that he was anti-communist. [...] However, the main reason that Colby stopped responding, according to Michel, was that once Wollheim found out that Moskowitz was also supplying stories, he offered Colby further material for free on condition that Colby stopped accepting Moskowitz's submissions.|$|E
2500|$|Hostettler {{was one of}} the [...] "true believers" [...] in the Republican {{freshman}} class of 1995.

Even those who disagreed with Hostettler felt that they <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stood and would likely give him {{the benefit of the doubt}} that he regularly voted in principle and not for political ends.|$|E

Some contrasted this with the kidnapping of Ciro Cirillo in 1981, a minor political figure for whom the government negotiated. However, Cirillo was released for a monetary ransom, rather than {{the release of the}} imprisoned extremists.|$|E

He never made a break from his parents, but they rarely <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was. Sometimes he came home and his mother would have to sew $100 bills into the seams of his blue jeans. He disappeared in Nicaragua. His body was later identified as a dead Sandinista freedom fighter. From a nice little house surrounded by evergreens {{at the other end}} of Washington Street, he left to look for something he needed to find. I believe in Sean Penn's Christopher McCandless.

Some other accounts say he was killed while scouting out a better position for his men a little distance away from their line and do not mention {{a challenge to the}} Union horsemen. Whether he had moved up to challenge the Union riders or to scout out a better position for his company as some accounts suggest, Marr was not in the immediate presence or line of sight of any of his men on the very dark night when he fell in the dense field.

2500|$|Jess Neely, a {{brilliant}} half-back and {{a handsome man}} on the campus, is remembered for his popularity {{among members of the}} opposite sex and for an incident that occurred just prior to a football game with Southern Presbyterian in Clarksville. Miles had done an exceptionally good job in mentally preparing his team for the game. He climaxed the pre-game, locker-room exhortation with a soaring call for courage and deathless allegiance to [...] "dear Ol' Normal." [...] Neely was greatly affected by the words of his coach for he leaped to his feet and, roaring like an angry bull, led the team in a rush to the doorway opening to the field. He misjudged the extremely low entrance, and his head received the full impact of the strip of wall above the doorway. He was revived shortly before the kickoff, but he never quite <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was, frequently huddling and aligning himself with the enemy.|$|E

The official stated that Ayman al-Zawahiri is believed to be hiding close to bin Laden in houses in northwest Pakistan, but are not together. Another U.S. official stated that bin Laden and Zawahiri are [...] "somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border," [...] but that their exact locations are unknown: [...] "If we <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was – in a house, an apartment, a villa or an underground cave or bunker – we would have gotten him; we can't rule out he may be in a cave one day and a house in a city on another." ...|$|E

[...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Lexa {{should be}} paired with Clarke was also debated, {{especially}} by {{fans of the}} Bellamy and Clarke relationship ("Bellarke"), which is canon in the books. This resulted in a rivalry between the fanbases. [...] In 2015, Sydney Bucksbaum of E! Online stated with regard to season 2, [...] "People {{who want to see}} Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Clarke (Eliza Taylor) get together—ahem, {{in every sense of the}} word—have had to suffer through a full season in which they were actually separated for pretty much the entire time." [...] Rothenberg told Bucksbaum that he was not dismissing the pairing; rather the Bellamy and Clarke romance was not yet the focus. He said the show gives indications that Bellamy and Clarke care deeply for each other, and those wanting a romance at the time should read the books. [...] "We played with the Lexa/Clarke storyline [...] and that [...] still ongoing because both characters [...] still breathing," [...] stated Rothenberg. [...] "The journey is long, and eventually we'll be able to tell that story in all its glory." [...] He said when it came to whether or not the series would end with Clarke and Lexa as a couple, he would not comment on the matter and <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted the series to go, but he was always open to better ideas. Eliza Taylor also weighed in on the matter, stating that she loves that bisexuality on the show is portrayed as normal, and that she also likes the chemistry between Bellamy and Clarke.|$|E
