5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
2500|$|Merman's {{fourth and}} final {{marriage}} was to actor Ernest Borgnine. They were married in Beverly Hills on June 27, 1964. They separated on August 7 and Borgnine filed for divorce on October 21. Merman filed a cross-complaint shortly thereafter charging Borgnine with extreme cruelty. She was granted a divorce on November 18, 1964. Borgnine later told fellow actor Frank Wilson that {{he spent most of}} his short marriage arguing with Merman. By the end, he recounted how she came back from a film one day and said, [...] "The director said I looked sensational. He said I had the face of a 20-year-old, and the body and legs of a 30-year-old!" [...] Borgnine replied, [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about your old cunt?" [...] "No," [...] replied Merman, [...] "he didn't mention you at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pooh, pooh! Deuce take it, Mr Richard, how dull you are!' cried Brass, {{relaxing}} into a smile. 'Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{about his}} property?--there!' ...|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. There's {{something}} {{we want to}} tell dear Vernon--before <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> to Fanny.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{for his own}} good,' said Mrs Griffith, angrily. 'I'm {{not ashamed}} of what I've done, and I'll tell him so to his face if <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> to me.' ...|$|R
60|$|DR. FREEMANTLE. <b>He</b> wouldn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to me either. Rather a {{bad sign}} when he won't talk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To the Chevalier,' {{said the}} Colonel; 'it {{is a good}} {{travelling}} name, and which we may both freely use. Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Permission to call!" [...] echoed small eyes, with a snigger. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about {{dinner in}} the Waldorf and a spin in his auto afterward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes, I dare say! We {{all know}} that. He means {{to give you}} some present worth having, I hope. Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> that looked like it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't fear what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> in the least!" [...] she {{answered}} proudly. [...] "But <b>he</b> won't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{of the sort}} you think. No, no." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{hope the}} invalid is--is improving," [...] he said, {{doubtful}} whether <b>he</b> should <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> on the delicate subject or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Carriage for the college!" [...] {{called the}} driver, approaching, and before <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> the Rovers had Tubbs in the turnout.|$|R
6000|$|... "Things of {{that kind}} make an {{impression}} on a new-comer," [...] Sylvia languidly remarked. [...] "One gets used to them after a while. Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A little ashamed, {{she blushed}} instead of speaking, {{and waited for}} Richard {{to come up and}} begin. Neither did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> and they paused till, the silence {{disturbing}} her, she ventured a [...] "Well, papa!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Miss Hernshaw, with a deep, inward breath, as if {{this now}} were indeed {{something}} like the punishment she had expected. [...] "And will it--did he think--did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the pecuniary effect--the--whether it would hurt the property?" ...|$|E
60|$|Before <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{more the}} train steamed out, leaving the would-be young fakir {{staring at it}} in {{distress}} and consternation.|$|R
5000|$|Lonely 'Packer': {{appeared}} {{in the last two}} episodes, looking sullenly at the toys on display. <b>He</b> didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> on screen throughout the programmes.|$|R
6000|$|Renouard’s face did not betray {{his opinion}} of that {{confident}} prophecy. <b>He</b> didn’t <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> till his friend suggested in the same meditative voice— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I see! That {{come after}} dinner, when our Navigator threw 'is cap down an' danced on it. Danby was quartermaster. They 'ad a tea-party on the bridge. It {{was the old}} man's contribution. Does <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the leadsmen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is his {{punishment}} for having {{run counter to}} his uncle's wishes and his uncle's principles. You cannot touch pitch and not be defiled." [...] The pitch, as Mr. Greenwood very well understood, was the first Marchioness. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about Hampstead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor dear," [...] said Edith sympathetically, {{beginning}} {{a search for}} the cologne. [...] "Lie down on the bed and I'll bathe your poor head. Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill? And how did you leave Sid? Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about coming up?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Master evidently {{meant to}} say more, but before <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> M. Durand had stepped right {{up to him and}} was speaking.|$|R
60|$|Grandfather Frog's eyes twinkled {{as he said}} this, and Peter {{looked very}} much embarrassed. But <b>he</b> didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> so Grandfather Frog went on.|$|R
5000|$|The plot follows James Bond Junior {{while he}} tries to uncover {{what is going on}} at Hazeley Hall. He and Sheelagh Smith, his [...] "girlfriend" [...] follow the clues of this mystery, but the {{information}} is given to the Commander of the police when James is injured. The Commander ultimately gets the credit for solving the case and threatens James if <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not talking}} about my hating him, or loving him. If he's honest to you, I'll neither say nor do {{anything}} to cross him. But if he does mane to marry you, it's time he did it; that's all. Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to father about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am terrified," [...] she said. [...] "Monsieur {{must come}} to my apartments one afternoon, where we can talk without fear. There is one more question, though," [...] she {{continued}} rapidly. [...] "Louis looked often at us. Tell me, did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to you about Monsieur Bartot and myself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} it is a job at all," [...] said Mrs. Trevelyan. [...] "Somebody is wanted, and nobody can know more of the service than papa does. But as the other man is a lord, I suppose papa must give way. Does <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about mamma, Nora?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, Jefferson," [...] said Fanny, whispering--for {{there had}} been a moment since their descent in which she had been {{instructed}} to call him by his Christian name--"never mind talking to me going home.

60|$|Science, with a {{thousand}} triumphs to her credit, has not yet succeeded in discovering the correct reply {{for a young man}} to make who finds himself in the appalling position of being apologized to by a pretty girl. If <b>he</b> <b>says</b> nothing <b>he</b> seems sullen and unforgiving. If <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> makes a fool of himself. Ashe, hesitating between these two courses, suddenly caught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring so long.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{just what}} she is, a pretty, nay, a {{beautiful}} soul, full of tenderness and forgiveness and affection and humility, only I doubt whether there is any force or resolution to hold her own. You smile! Well, perhaps the less of that she has the better she may get on with him. Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Intellectually a nonentity,” Ossipon {{pronounced}} aloud, abandoning {{suddenly the}} inward contemplation of Mrs Verloc’s bereaved person and business. “Quite an ordinary personality. You are wrong in not keeping more {{in touch with}} the comrades, Professor,” he added in a reproving tone. “Did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to you—give you some idea of his intentions? I hadn’t seen him for a month. It seems impossible that he should be gone.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Simple Sally {{looked at}} him with a vague sense of alarm. Her heart beat fast, under the perpetually {{recurring}} fear that she had done something or said something to offend him. [...] "Was it bad behaviour in me," [...] she asked, [...] "to fall asleep in the chair?" [...] Reassured, so far, she was still as anxious as ever to get at the truth. After long hesitation, and long previous thought, she ventured to try another question. [...] "The gentleman sent me out of the room--did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to set you against me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not in {{the habit}} of loafing," [...] Jet replied, just a trifle indignantly, and before <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more the short man added impatiently: ...|$|R
60|$|Billy Mink chuckled so that Longlegs heard him, {{and that}} didn't improve his temper a bit. But before <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more, Little Joe Otter spoke.|$|R
