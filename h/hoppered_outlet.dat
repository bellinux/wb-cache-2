40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanism}} of discharge of fine powders from hoppers is examined. Gas pressure measurements were taken in {{the proximity of the}} <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet,</b> mainly along the axis, while discharging fine powders. Different types of pressure traces were detected depending on the solid properties. A simple model was developed to account for the main features of pressure profiles. The main hypothesis relies on the presence of a surface near the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> which defines a discontinuous change in the voidage of the discharging solids. From the fluid dynamic point of view, the solid above this surface bl:haves as a permeable compact; the solid below, instead, can be considered as a moving suspension of solids in gas. This region appears to be the major responsible of the pressure gradients inside the hopper. A good agreement between model and results indicates that, in spite of its simplicity, the models accounts for the main phenomena involved. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{gravity flow}} of bulk solids from mass flow bins and hoppers {{is a subject}} of {{considerable}} practical and theoretical interest Many published papers have brought {{greater understanding of the}} flowrate of coarse particles. Research on finer materials was insufficient due to imprecise predictions of the air pressure gradient at the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet,</b> which is a very important factor in predicting the flowrate of the fine particles. The work in this thesis develops theoretical models for predicting the interstitial air pressure gradient and for predicting the flowrate of bulk solids from conical mass flow bins. The theoretical models are based on the continuum mechanics theory. The boundary conditions follow air pressure and bulk density continuity in a vertical direction. A close agreement between theoretical results and experimental results was obtained for predicting both flowrate and air pressure distribution. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the flowrate of free flowing bulk solids increases rapidly at first and then more gradually as the particle permeability constant increases. The use of 2 ̆ 7 permeability 2 ̆ 7 enables the theories developed to be applied in describing the flow behaviour of both coarse and fine particle mixtures as well as composite particle size-distributed bulk solids. The use of consolidation-related bulk density and permeability enables the theoretical models to be applied to both compressible and incompressible materials. Results of both theoretical and experimental work on the effect of material surcharge level on the flowrate indicate that for fine materials this effect is significant. Based on the original theoretical model, simplified expressions for predicting the dynamic deaeration coefficient Kdea and a simplified flowrate model are presented. Finally, the study is extended to examine, theoretically and experimentally, the use of standpipes attached at the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> to increase the limiting gravitational flowrate...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with some plane strain and axially symmetric free surface problems which arise {{in the study of}} static granular solids that satisfy the Coulomb-Mohr yield condition. Such problems are inherently nonlinear, and hence difficult to attack analytically. Given a Coulomb friction condition holds on a solid boundary, it is shown that the angle a free surface is allowed to attach to the boundary is dependent only on the angle of wall friction, assuming the stresses are all continuous at the attachment point, and assuming also that the coefficient of cohesion is nonzero. As a model problem, the formation of stable cohesive arches in hoppers is considered. This undesirable phenomena is an obstacle to flow, and occurs when the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> is too small. Typically, engineers are concerned with predicting the critical outlet size for a given hopper and granular solid, so that for <b>hoppers</b> with <b>outlets</b> larger than this critical value, arching cannot occur. This is a topic of considerable practical interest, with most accepted engineering methods being conservative in nature. Here, the governing equations in two limiting cases (small cohesion and high angle of internal friction) are considered directly.

In order to validate the theories of flow prediction and design of conical hoppers, the flow properties of two bulk solids were determined, the theories of Jenike’s flowability and Enstad and Walker for hopper design were analyzed and the results were compared with those experimentally obtained in a reduced model of a semicircular-section silo. Results show that Enstad theory for the hopper design is adequate to occur mass flow inside the silo, and for the sizing of the discharge outlet, the Walker’s theory was closer to the appropriate than Jenike’s theory, which was higher around 100 % than the experimental <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet...</b>|$|R

The variation of solid concentration is less than 1 % in the transition flow region. The particle acceleration in the converging flow region decreases with increasing the height along hopper.

The constitutive relations cover the elastic and the plastic regions including the flow state and represent the friction mechanism of granular material. We considered the effect of air on the granular flow and pile by the two-way coupling method. The granular flow patterns, the shapes of piles and the granular flow rates in the evolution are compared with experimental data measured under the same conditions. There was good agreement between these results, which suggests that the constitutive relations and the simulation method would be applicable for predicting granular flows and pile formation with complex geometry including free surface geometry.

In this work we intend to evaluate the possibility to successfully apply the Jenike procedure {{to the design of}} storage units containing biomass solids. On this purpose two sawdust samples, a dry one and a humid one, were taken into account. Internal flow properties were characterized by a Schulze ring shear tester while wall friction properties was characterized by a Brookfield Powder Flow Tester. The critical outlet size to allow arch free flow of powder was directly evaluated on a purposely built 0. 3 m 3 plane silo. In this silo the wedge shaped hopper allowed to continuously and independently change the hopper angle and the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> size. Finally, the relationship between the measured flow functions and the arching conditions was assessed by comparing the experimental critical outlet size values with those calculated according to the Jenike design procedure. The results obtained from this comparison indicate that the Jenike procedure is adequate for design purposes with the tested materials. However, it has to be noted that in some cases the difference between the experimental values and the design values of the critical outlet size for an arch free silo is so small to suggest the use of safety coefficients in the application of the design procedure. Furthermore, several biomass particulates, such as those deriving from weeds, straws or canes, may present particle elongation ratios much larger than those of the tested materials and, therefore, the assessment of the flow properties and of the silo design procedure for such materials deserve further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} rate of coarse powders (mean particle size 500 ¿m) from bunkers without aeration {{can be described}} by both empirical relations and theoretical models. In the case of small particles the {{discharge rate}} is largely overestimated. As the powder dilates during flow a negative pressure gradient develops near the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet,</b> inducing an air flow into the hopper. This extra drag force decreases the discharge rate for fine particles. Aeration of the hopper through a porous cone section will create an opposite pressure gradient, and thereby increase the discharge rate. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to incorporate the dilation in an ad hoc way into the model of Altiner in order to improve its predictive power. To test the modified model we carried out experiments with a fluid catalytic cracking powder to study its discharge as a function of aeration. As the improved model needs a dilation parameter as input, the local bulk density was measured during flow at the outlet and at the bin/hopper junction using gamma-ray absorption. At the bin/hopper junction the bulk density was found to be independent of the discharge rate and equal to the bulk density at minimum fluidisation. At the outlet the bulk density goes through a maximum when the amount of aeration gas is increased. Without aeration gas a large dilation, i. e. a 15 ¿ 35 % lower bulk density, was observed. With these data the model predictions improved from 600 % overestimation error to 25 ¿ 90 % underestimation for pure gravity discharge, and from 100 % to 0 ¿ 20 % error for aerated discharge.

Many parameters influence the discharge rate including: the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> width, the angle of the hopper wall, the particle size, and particle friction, and so on. Due to the expensive of examining a large variety of particle types and hopper conditions, computational simulation has been widely studied in an effort to establish an alternative method of determining critical factors impacting hopper flow. In this thesis, the process of hopper discharge has been simulated by the Discrete Element Method (DEM), {{which is one of the}} most popular methods for granular flow simulation. To validate against existing experiments, all conditions were matched as closely as possible to those in the experiment. The particles used in our simulation are spheroids with diameters of 0. 77 cm. The angles of the hoppers examined range from 0 ◦ to 90 ◦, while the opening sizes vary from 2. 9 cm to 4. 3 cm. Computationally, the friction coefficient has been adjusted several times and finally is set to 0. 5 in the simulation in order to fit the experimental resultsas closely as possible. As a quantitative test of the simulation fidelity we compare the hopper empty time t – which is related to the hopper discharge rate – for these different hopper angles and hopper opening size. As a secondary test of the fit, the survival time τ, the normal force profile, the velocity profile, and the probability of jamming Ps are also computed and compared to existing experimental data from collaborators at Duke University.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} may readily segregate due {{to differences}} in particle properties such as size, shape, and density. This segregation may occur in many industrial processes involving granular materials and will occur even after a material has been uniformly blended. Segregation is typically problematic in that the quality of products is usually contingent upon maintaining some measure of blend homogeneity. The present work aims to investigate the causes and extent of segregation of granular materials during flow from a hopper. Segregation data are obtained from discharge of quasi-three-dimensional wedge-shaped hoppers and fully three-dimensional cylindrical hoppers. The granular material is modeled as bidisperse, inelastic, frictional spheres via the discrete element method (DEM) employing a soft-particle contact model. Complementary experimentation in small hoppers with bidisperse, glass beads provides data for validation purposes. These small-scale experiments allow for direct comparison with the computational data on a one-to-one basis. ^ Results show the extent of segregation increases with particle diameter ratio while it decreases with increasing fines mass fraction and the ratio of <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> size to particle size. Additionally, parameters such as the hopper aspect ratio and wall angle affect the shape of the segregation profile over the course of discharge. Further, the extent of segregation is observed to increase with both the particle-particle and particle-wall friction coefficients. A brief study of three different hopper fill methods shows that the initial state homogeneity has a pronounced effect on the discharge profile. ^ The DEM data also permit visualization of the internal granular flow and microstructure. Colors are assigned to each particle based on a measured quantity such as the particle velocity, residence time, or the local mass fraction [...] -a new color scheme developed in this work. Thus, the development of spatial concentration gradients during flow is observed, which provides novel insight as to how the fundamental segregation mechanisms manifest themselves in hopper geometries to yield the given discharge segregation results. Using the segregation results and flow visualizations, recommendations for reducing the extent of segregation during hopper flow from a product and process development standpoint are made. ...|$|R

In the present work, a feed delivery {{system for a}} solar gasification reactor was designed, fabricated and tested. The feedstock delivery system delivers the required amount of feedstock into the reactor which is a cavity of molten salt held at 1200 K. The feed delivery rate was from 8 ±(0. 4) gm/min to 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The cellulose feed particles were of diameter 0. 5 mm. The feed delivery system is comprised of hopper, screw feeder, stepper motor and feed injector. The hopper was designed to store a feed supply needed for continuous one hour operation of the reactor at the feed delivery rate of 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The screw feeder, which is rotated using a stepper motor, draws the feed particles from the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> and carries them in forward direction to the feed injector.

40|$|Dosage of fine powders from {{storage bin}} to process vessels can {{represent}} a {{significant source of}} troubles due to the cohesive arching and piping phenomena especially under low consolidation conditions. Distributed injection of air from the hopper walls was proven to be an efficient flow promotion technique to prevent cohesive arching and piping [1 - 2]. Moreover, aeration can be applied also to increase the solid discharge rate with respect to that achievable under the gravity alone [3]. In this study, the aerated silo discharge is experimentally assessed for fine powders of pharmaceutical interest. In particular, experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale cylindrical bin with a 45 °conical hopper. The discharged solids were collected in a bin placed on a load cell. The air flow rate through the distributor was regulated by mass thermal flowmeters. Three powder samples of different flowability (from easy flowing to cohesive according to the Jenike classification) made of microcrystalline cellulose and crystalline lactose were tested. Results show a beneficial effect of aeration on the solid discharge rate and confirm the phenomenology observed in previous studies with different powders. In particular, the solid discharge rate of the easy flowing microcrystalline cellulose powder A increases almost linearly with increasing air fow rate up to a plateau value. Differently, the discharge of microcrystalline cellulose B and of crystalline lactose could not be achieved under the gravity alone. As expected for cohesive powders, a minimum aeration was necessary to prevent arching at the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> and determine the powder discharge. This critical value was compared with that evaluated according to the design criteria previously proposed by the research group [1 - 2]. Further increase of the air flow rate caused less significant increase of the solid discharge rate before attaining a plateau value. A model [3] was applied to predict the solid discharge rate {{as a function of the}} air flow rate. In the case of the cohesive powders the formation of aggregates was properly taken into account. In particular, the relevant aggregate size was evaluated by means of cohesion values obtained by conventional and innovative experimental methods.

40|$|Powders are {{important}} commodities across different industries, {{such as the}} food and pharmaceutical industries. In these industries, powders are usually made, mixed, milled, packaged, and stored; these operations require the powders to move and flow under desired conditions and different stress levels. Failure to flow will cause hindrances to production; therefore knowledge of powder flow or flowability is important. There is a constant demand for accurate, reliable, and robust measurement and characterization methods for powder flowability. Powders behave differently under varying conditions; the behaviour of a powder is influenced by particle size distribution, and powder handling and processing conditions. There is to date no one “standard” method to characterize powder flowability; {{it is common to}} use a variety of methods and devices to measure flow properties and provide insight into the behaviour and flow characteristics of powders under different conditions. The flow properties of model food and mineral powders were measured and assessed by shear testing, compression via tapping, fluidization, and powder tumbling. Shear testing was done with an annular shear cell following Jenike (1964) and Berry, Bradley and McGregor (2014). Compression via tapping was performed according to a procedure in the dairy industry (Niro, 1978) and the European Pharmacopoeia (Schüssele & Bauer-Brandl, 2003). Fluidization was used to measure powder bed expansion and bed collapse following the powder classification framework provided by Geldart and co-workers (Geldart, 1973; Geldart, Harnby, & Wong, 1984; Geldart & Wong, 1984, 1985). Powder tumbling was performed in a novel Gravitational Displacement Rheometer, GDR, which measured the motion and avalanche activity of powders that moved under their own weight when rotated in a cylinder at different drum speed levels. The flow data from each characterization method were evaluated individually with regards to particle size distribution and then assessed collectively. The findings presented and discussed include the i) demonstration of the dominant influence of surface-volume mean particle diameter on powder flow properties, ii) characterization of flowability based on Jenike’s arbitrary flow divisions, iii) development of new correlations for the estimation of powder cohesion and bulk density at low preconsolidation stresses, iv) demonstration of <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet</b> diameter as a measure of flowability, v) demonstration of the limited utility of Hausner ratio as a flowability index, vi) substantiation of von Neumann ratio as a sensitive and useful indicator for identifying the onset of bubbling in fluidized beds using bed pressure fluctuation data, and vii) demonstration of the utility of standard deviation of the GDR load cell signal as an indicator of powder avalanche activity.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} are extensively used throughout many industries. In countries like Australia and South Africa, national economies are critically {{dependent on the}} agricultural and mining industries, {{and it is important}} to understand bulk material behaviour in order to handle these materials properly. There are many diverse approaches to modelling granular materials. In this thesis, the Coulomb-Mohr continuum mechanical theory of granular materials is utilised, and some exact analytical solutions are presented for both stress and velocity fields. These solutions are formally valid provided sin? = 1, where ? is the angle of internal friction, and they provide limiting solutions for so called highly frictional granular materials, for which sin? � 1. The solutions so obtained are exploited for three real industrial granular problems, namely gravity flow from converging hoppers, the stress distribution in stockpiles and finally, the stress distribution within rat-holes. The flow of granular materials, in the presence of gravity, through a converging hopper is an important problem that occurs in many industrial processes. Here, for highly frictional granular materials for both wedge and conical hopper flows, exact analytical solutions are obtained to determine the stress and velocity fields within the neighborhood of the <b>hopper</b> <b>outlet.</b> For the same problem, these exact solutions are exploited as the leading order terms in a regular perturbation series, where the correction terms are of order 1 - sin?. In this way, approximate analytical solutions are obtained that can be used to describe the behaviour of more realistic granular materials. The practice of storing granular materials in stockpiles occurs throughout the world in many industrial situations. In this thesis, exact solutions for highly frictional granular {{materials are}} used for the determination of the stress distributions within two-dimensional and axially symmetric stockpiles. Stockpile profiles considered here include the standard wedge and cone, as well as two-dimensional parabolic and axially symmetric cubic curved shaped stockpiles. We emphasise that curved stockpiles have not previously been considered in the literature. Our model assumes that the stockpile is composed of two regions, namely an inner rigid region and an outer yield region. The exact solution applies in the outer yield region, which is then extended continuously into the inner rigid region. A rat-hole is the general term used to describe those stable cavities, which frequently occur in storage hoppers and stockpiles, whose formation prevents further material falling through the outlet. In this thesis, we present exact solutions for both two-dimensional and axially symmetric rat-holes, where it is assumed that the highly frictional granular material has flowed through a central outlet, until the point is reached when there is no further flow of material. The remaining material is assumed to be in limiting equilibrium, that is static but on the point of yield. In both two dimensions and axial symmetry, two types of rat-holes are studied. The first type has a sloping upper surface of infinite extent, where the material is resting on a sloping rigid base containing an infinitesimal central outlet. The second type has a curved upper surface, where the material is resting between vertical walls and a horizontal rigid plane containing an infinitesimal central outlet. Again, we emphasise that neither of these rat-hole problems have previously been investigated in the literature.

40|$|The {{handling}} and storage of black coal has always presented industry with problems of erratic or spasmodic feed, partial reclamation {{of the total}} contents of bins and flow blockages at <b>hopper</b> <b>outlets.</b> These problems can lead to extreme cost penalties for all users, from the coal producers and export market loading facilities to the secondary industries using coal for process energy requirements. Any reduction in the occurrence of these handling problems and the subsequent increase in efficiency would be of benefit. The aim of this work was to investigate two major aspects {{in the design of}} coal storage bins to ensure reliable and predictable operation, particularly in regard to gravity assisted discharge. First an experimental study investigated the flow properties of black coal and the influence on these flow properties of variations in the physical characteristics of the test samples. Variables considered included moisture content, particle top size of test samples, coal particle shape, time consolidation at rest and ash content. Samples for the test program were obtained from the six collieries located in the Southern Coalfields (Illawarra Measures) of the Sydney Basin of New South Wales. The coals ranged in rank from sub-bituminous to semi-anthracite. The study highlighted the most influential variables to be moisture content, sample particle size and time consolidation at rest. Other factors such as particle shape, coal rank and ash content were minor considerations. Often a variation of variable affected other properties and led to decreased sample flowability. A common example was that of coals with a high friability; this leads to greater particle degradation and generation of fines with handling operations, which then leads to higher moisture retention capabilities and significantly large critical arching dimensions, particularly with time storage. The flow property testing program utilised a Jenike - type Direct Shear Tester for the coal sample shear testing. To improve the consistency of this instrument, and eliminate operator and test data interpretation related errors a standardised testing procedure was developed. The second aspect of investigation dealt with the design procedures for the determination of mass flow hopper geometries based on the coal flow properties and utilising the well accepted theories of Jenike. A novel method of design data presentation was developed which links the flow properties and the hopper geometry parameters. This was achieved by presenting all parameters as a function of a common independent variable, the major consolidation stress. This approach has advantages in accounting for experimental error in the flow properties and for the determination of hopper geometries that have design constraints. The hopper design procedures were further advanced by the development of an alternate presentation of the original Jenike flow factor charts. These alternative charts have been abbreviated to display only the critical design values in the border region between mass flow and funnel flow. The charts eliminate the need for imprecise parameter interpolations by displaying the required design parameters in the form of contours of constant wall slope and flow factor {{as a function of the}} effective angle of internal friction and kinematic angle of wall friction. These new concepts were combined to allow the generation of manual hopper geometry design nomograms or worksheets. This design presentation represents a compact and rapid method for the determination of mass flow hopper geometry parameters for axisymmetric and plane flow outlets. The influence and sensitivity of the coal sample variations was explored further by determining the hopper geometry parameters of wall slope and outlet dimension based on the respective flow properties. This has allowed standardised hopper design guidelines to be formulated. An important aspect highlighted by this study was the significant role of wall friction in achieving a successful design. In consideration of the design procedures for bulk solid storage, computer software was developed and implemented for the computer aided design of storage bins. Two programs were developed, the first, to aid in the rapid processing and analysis of experimental flow property data, describing the flow properties by empirical equations and graphically. The second program utilised the empirical flow property equations for the determination of critical hopper geometry parameters and the generation of other design graphs. The programs operate both on a mainframe computer and a microcomputer, and utilise interactive execution and high resolution graphics...|$|R

The opportunity to simultaneously attain reliable discharge and partial moisture removal is also examined. The selection of design parameters to maximise the consolidation stresses in both the cylindrical and hopper sections is detailed. In regard to the latter, it is recommended fine coal bins be discharged using low friction lined transition <b>hoppers</b> with large <b>outlet</b> spans. Such outlets will discharge fine coal in a relatively compacted state. This compaction state should exhibit minimum water retention and short term moisture uptake. The multiphase attributes of fiDe damp coal flow is then considered. Here is it noted, {{as a consequence of}} the dilation in the hopper negative or suction interstitial fluid pressures form. It is noted such pressures generate an adverse pressure gradient which significantly retards the discharge. One technique to conveniently eliminate the adverse pressure gradient is to install low pressure high volume air sparging to the hopper. It is suggested this air sparging will have the added benefit of effecting partial moisture reduction. This technique should prove far more reliable than post feeder compaction using relatively complex mechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake <b>outlet,</b> <b>hopper,</b> conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{flows in}} hoppers {{have been studied}} {{extensively}} in the past years. One way of approaching the problem {{is to focus on}} theoretical investigation of the bulk flow properties at the macroscopic scale: global flow pattern, wall pressure and strains (Brown et al., 2000), optimal design of <b>hopper</b> geometry and <b>outlet</b> size (Gremaud et al., 2000, Shang Jing et al., 1998), etc. Besides, theories have emerged (Drescher et al., 1995) to link the macroscale behaviour to the micro-scale phenomena acting on the particle level, like arching for example. This can be done by considering the granular matrix as a series of isolated structural members (referring to the so-called Structural Mechanics, SM) or as a continuum (Continuum Mechanics approach, CM). A different approach aims at modelling the inter-particle forces by statistical models (Coppersmith, 1997), or at describing the behaviour of individual particles as well as their interactions during collisions. This leads to computational models referred to as Discrete Elements Simulations (Mattutis et al., 2000) analogous to molecular simulations, which have proved their power but also their limits: due to their complexity, such models are constrained to deal only with simple systems containing a limited number of particles. Resorting to experimental work is essential in order to compare such theories and models with reality at all levels. Tests on scale models have been carried out for a long time, where quantitative measurements of macroscopic parameters were possible. However, even if phenomena at the particle level were qualitatively observed or suspected, only few quantitative indications could be gained from them. Recently, new investigation techniques have benefited from the rapid technological innovations. Among them, non-intrusive digital imaging and related image-processing techniques have increased tremendously the potential of traditional photography. Several authors have applied similar techniques for the experimental characterisation of granular flows in hoppers (Langston et al., 1997, Samadani et al., 1999) or in vibrated granular beds (Hsiau et al., 1998). They were initially limited to bulk observations, like deformations of the granular matrix within the silo, e. g. by tracking the shape of initially horizontal layers of coloured particles. More recently a further step introduced a change of focus from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale, by tracking the movement of individual particles within the matrix. Such techniques, to the knowledge of the author, have always been restricted to the tracking of a small proportion of coloured tracer particles mixed in the dispersion (Hryciw et al., 1997, Losert et al., 1999) or to very large particles. The reason for this limitation {{is to be found in}} the characteristics of the particle tracking algorithms, whose robustness is a function of granular concentration and flow velocity: when the interframe particle displacement becomes of the order of magnitude of the particle interdistance (which is close to particle diameter for dense flows in hoppers), the available methods tend to fail quite rapidly, as well the simplest ones relying on minimum displacement matching as the more sophisticated ones, based on trajectory coherence. In the present work, preliminary results are presented, where a novel particle-tracking method is applied to the characterisation of granular flow in a wedge-shaped plane hopper. Derived from an original pattern-based principle aimed at addressing the above shortcomings, the method (Capart et al., 2001) is able to resolve individual grain motions even for rapid flows of dense, intensively sheared dispersions. Full automation is achieved, allowing the derivation of accurate statistics from large sets of individual measurements, as well as the construction of complete sets of grain trajectories. This set of methods has recently been extended to the third dimension by resorting to stereoscopic imagery (Spinewine et al., 2000), allowing 3 D measurements of free surface topography, 3 D particle tracking and velocimetry, as well as accurate estimation of volumetric granular concentration...|$|R
