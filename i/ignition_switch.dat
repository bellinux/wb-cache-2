5000|$|On June 30, 2014, GM {{announced}} {{they were going}} to recall 8.45 million additional cars, almost all of which were being recalled for defective <b>ignition</b> <b>switches.</b> This announcement brings the total number of recalled cars in North America to about 29 million. [...] In November 2014 emails surfaced that showed GM ordered a half-million replacement <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> nearly 2 months before ordering a recall.|$|R
5000|$|Faulty <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> in the Cobalts, which cut {{power to}} the car while in motion, were {{eventually}} linked to many crashes resulting in fatalities, starting with a teenager in 2005 who drove her new Cobalt into a tree. [...] The switch continued {{to be used in}} the manufacture of the vehicles even after the problem was known to GM. On February 21, 2014, GM recalled over 700,000 Cobalts for issues traceable to the defective <b>ignition</b> <b>switches.</b> In May 2014 the NHTSA fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. Thirteen deaths were linked to the faulty switches during the time the company failed to recall the cars.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally, this ballast {{resistor}} would fail and the classic symptom of this failure {{was that the}} engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch).</b> Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a {{ballast resistor}} as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{was at a}} high level for an automobile of this era. These features included a heater, theft-proof locks, rotary door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were mildly revised {{with minor}} {{changes to the}} {{instrument}} panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls {{to the left of the}} steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ignition</b> <b>switches</b> or locks are {{combined}} with security locking {{of the steering}} column (in many modern vehicles) or the gear lever (such as in Saab Automobile vehicles). In the latter, the switch is between the seats, preventing damage to the driver's knee {{in the event of}} a collision.|$|R
50|$|On June 16, 2014, GM {{announced}} they were recalling 3.4 million more cars, {{all of which}} were produced from 2000 to 2004. They also announced that they intended to replace the cars' keys because if they did not, the <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> could rotate, causing the car's engines to shut off and disabling power steering.|$|R
25|$|On April 24, 2014, CNNMoney {{reported}} that GM profits fell to $108 {{million for the}} first three months of 2014. GM now estimates the cost of their 2014 recall due to faulty <b>ignition</b> <b>switches,</b> which have been linked to at least 13 deaths, at $1.3 billion. Shares of GM were down 16% for the year before the new announcement of GM's lower profits.|$|R
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} changes {{were to the}} interior. The {{dashboard}} layout of the original 110 from 1983 (which was in turn {{very similar to that}} used on the Series III from 1971) was replaced with a full-width fascia and different instrumentation. Instruments came from the Discovery 3, and some of the centre panels come from the Ford Transit. Whilst some interior fittings from the British Leyland parts bin - some of which dated back to the 1970s - were finally dropped, the steering column switchgear (sourced from the Mk.1 Austin Metro) and the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> (from the Morris Marina) was carried over from the previous interior. A new heater and ventilation system improved de-misting and heater performance.|$|E
25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E
50|$|GM {{said the}} parts needed {{to repair the}} faulty <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> were {{expected}} to become available on April 7, 2014. However, that same day, CNN Money contacted six dealerships, none of whom had received these parts. A spokesman for GM, Alan Adler, said that he didn't know how many replacement parts had been shipped to dealerships, or when the majority of parts would be available.|$|R
5000|$|During the hearings, Barbara Boxer asked Barra why, {{during the}} 33 years {{she worked at}} GM prior to {{becoming}} the CEO in 2013, she never heard anything about the faulty <b>ignition</b> <b>switches.</b> After Barra failed to give a substantive answer, Boxer exclaimed to her that [...] "You don't know anything about anything," [...] and that [...] "If {{this is the new}} GM leadership, it's pretty lacking." ...|$|R
50|$|A strange {{phenomenon}} {{was observed}} at Kalo Dungar, when some visitors noticed that their vehicles were hurtling down the hill at speeds over 80 km/h even with the <b>ignition</b> <b>switched</b> off. The team of experts from the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), and Institute of Seismological Research, Gandhinagar and Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur studied the phenomenon. It is concluded that the vehicle hurtle down fast due to the more gradient of the slope.|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|E

500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was leaning forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him I am only a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E
50|$|The Opel GT shared {{many parts}} with other Opel models, mostly the Kadett B. Opel also used {{variants}} of the CIH engine from 1966 to 1995, so most parts are somewhat available. Also, in the USA and Europe, there are companies which specialize in Opel GT parts and services; including some new body parts. Some of the rarest and most costly parts are the <b>ignition</b> <b>switches,</b> rear trim strips, and 1968-1970 rear axle bearings.|$|R

2500|$|The KR200 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (fan) cooled single {{cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of contact breaker points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E
2500|$|On the inside, {{the hidden}} folding cup holder that {{popped out of}} the centre console in {{previous}} models {{was replaced by a}} simpler and more durable in-console design with sliding covers [...] similar in concept, but higher quality, to those in the Range Rover Sport. The <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> was moved from {{the lower part of the}} centre console up to the dashboard, next to the steering wheel and the Range Rover received the Range Rover Sport / LR3's Terrain Response system as well as a redesigned four-wheel drive control panel.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the same}} {{calendar}} {{year that the}} Flame of Hope was first lit, it was vandalized. A 26-year-old man admitted to smothering the monument with his jacket, ultimately smashing the <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> and burners, and causing $1,760 in damage. The Queen Mother sent a letter expressing her regret, and encouraging its re-kindling. The man responsible, who was remorseful, was sentenced to do community service, as well as pay for the repairs.

2500|$|Initially, the Argentinian Chevy used {{very similar}} trim to the American counterpart, while more luxurious – a [...] "big" [...] car by local {{standard}}s. They there standard models without accessories and {{were used for}} cab service. The interior layout remained the American 1968 version for the entire run. The <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> remained dash mounted as the US-mandated steering lock was not required in Argentina. Power steering became available {{at the end of}} the production run. V8s versions weren't produced: [...] Power windows were not available, tinted windows were darker than American versions, and the darker band on the upper edge of the windshield was not present.|$|E
2500|$|The package {{started with}} an {{exclusive}} engine version, the high performance [...] 9.8:1 compression ratio 232 six cylinder with Carter WCD carburetor and 266 degree camshaft designed by VAM's own engineering department. The {{rest of the}} accessories consisted of a black two-arm sports steering wheel with a central bullseye emblem, wide reclining individual front seats, floor-mounted Hurst Performance shifter 150-T three-speed manual transmission with locking mechanism connected to the steering wheel <b>ignition</b> <b>switch,</b> full bright molding package including rear panel overlay between the tail lights and two courtesy lights. Unlike the 1969 version, power drum brakes were no longer included, which were available separately as optional equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{commercial}} {{success of the}} Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever {{on the side of}} the column to keep the <b>ignition</b> <b>switch</b> from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968-1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM 252 six producing [...] at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single-barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969-1970 VAM Javelins. Due to this, the [...] "232 SIX" [...] emblems were removed in favor of new [...] "252" [...] units.|$|E

This function, which is optional under UN and US regulations, is served passively and without power consumption in the United States by the mandatory side marker retroreflectors.|$|R
50|$|Typical airbag {{systems are}} {{completely}} disabled by {{turning off the}} ignition key. Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine, power steering, and power brakes, and may be the direct cause of an accident. If a violent collision occurs, the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants. In 2014, General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal accidents caused by defective <b>ignition</b> <b>switches</b> which would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags).
