5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|Dehejia {{states that}} Vedic {{literature}} has {{no mention of}} any practice resembling Sati. There is only one mention in the Vedas, of a widow lying <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> dead husband who is asked to leave the grieving {{and return to the}} living, then prayer is offered for a happy life for her with children and wealth. Dehejia writes that this passage does not imply a pre-existing sati custom, nor of widow remarriage, nor that it is authentic verse because its solitary mention may also be explained as a later date insertion into the text. Dehejia writes that no ancient or early medieval era Buddhist texts mention sati, and if the practice existed it would likely have been condemned by these texts.|$|E
500|$|Gérôme made {{at least}} two {{previous}} oil paintings {{and a number of}} sketches in preparation for the work. [...] One [...] shows Cleopatra lying on the ground stretching out to Julius Caesar [...] with Apollodorus crouching behind her. [...] In one variation before the finished version, Caesar is shown by himself with his hands on the desk (instead of outstretched) without his four secretaries. When the work was finished in 1866, Cleopatra's position changed to show her standing before Caesar with Apollodorus bent <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

60|$|The bark shelter {{would just}} hold {{the two of}} them, and Nasmyth, dripping, sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b> She looked very forlorn.|$|R

60|$|Ruth nestled <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> him on <b>her</b> knees, and {{clasped her}} arms about his neck.|$|R
60|$|Gilbert sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> on {{the boulder}} {{and held out}} his Mayflowers.|$|E
60|$|He knelt <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b> What did she mean? But he {{knew well}} enough.|$|E
60|$|And sitting <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> on the deck, {{he poured}} forth his miserable history.|$|E
60|$|Emboldened by her silence, and by {{the softer}} {{expression}} of her face, he sat <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> and anon placed his hand on hers. She withdrew it quietly and serenely as was her wont, but quite without anger.|$|R
60|$|ARJILLAX. Ask Martellus: {{do not ask}} me. I {{know nothing}} of him. [He leaves Martellus, and sits <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> Ecrasia, on <b>her</b> left].|$|R

60|$|Ruth turned {{pale and}} {{dropped into a}} chair, and Mr. Swift sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She had knelt down, and the king, {{still holding}} her hand, knelt <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He knelt <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b> He slipped one arm {{round her}} waist. He patted her hands.|$|E
6000|$|Cyril sat <b>down,</b> all tremulous <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> {{took the}} white hand unresisted in his, {{and said to}} her gently, [...] "Oh, Netta, what is this for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Rector, {{stumbling}} like a blind man, suffered {{himself to}} be led. He {{sat down on the}} sofa, and Mrs. Pendyce sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> him, <b>her</b> hand still on his arm; over her face passed little quivers, as though she were holding herself in. She repeated in her gentle voice: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hastings {{drove away}} with Agatha. She said {{little to the}} girl during the journey, but an hour after they had reached the {{homestead}} she slipped quietly into Agatha's room.

60|$|She {{sat down}} on a log {{at the corner of the}} house, and pulled me <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|CHRIS--[Sits <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> with a sigh.] It's gatting pooty late in night, Anna. Must be near five bells.|$|E
60|$|Glynn {{returned}} the squeeze, and {{opening the door}} of Ailie's private cabin, entered and sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> crib.|$|E
60|$|She kneeled <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> it, passed <b>her</b> {{arm over}} his neck, and drew {{his face to}} hers. She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to him.|$|R
60|$|He {{really was}} quite touched. There was something, too, in the {{surroundings}} which was sympathetic. He embraced them all, and evidently {{looked at his}} wife with amazement, sitting <b>down</b> at last <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> with his little boy upon his knee.|$|R
60|$|I sat <b>down</b> awkwardly <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> my head buzzing just a little, as {{with one}} glass {{too many of}} champagne. I was in my {{literary}} childhood. One small book and a few essays and criticisms, scattered through various obscure periodicals had been as yet my only contributions to current literature. The sudden discovery that I was the Mr. Anybody, and that charming women thought of me, and were delighted to meet me, was a brain- disturbing thought.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{saw that}} she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Master sate <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> on the earthen bank, and {{permitted}} her {{to touch}} his features with her trembling hand.|$|E

60|$|Alicia sat <b>down</b> and he <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> {{and when}} he had put his arms about her, he kissed her face and lips.

60|$|The new corn-stacks {{were big}} and golden {{as they went}} by, an army of white geese marched aside in braggart protest. Ursula was light as a white ball of <b>down.</b> Skrebensky drifted <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> indefinite, his old from loosened, and another self, grey, vague, {{drifting}} out as from a bud. They talked lightly, of nothing.|$|R
60|$|From {{the time}} they had quitted the burning room to that moment, Waters had passed into his listless, {{abstracted}} condition, so helpless and feeble that he retained the grasp of M'liss's hand more through some instinctive prompting rather than the dictates of reason. M'liss had found it necessary to almost drag him from the main street and the hurrying crowd, which seemed to exercise a strange fascination over his bewildered senses. And now he sat <b>down</b> passively <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> and seemed to submit to the guidance of her superior nature.|$|R
