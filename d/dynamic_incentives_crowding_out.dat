40|$|In both {{experimental}} and natural settings incentives sometimes under-perform, generating smaller eects on the targeted behaviors {{than would be}} predicted for entirely self-regarding agents. A parsimonious explanation is that incentives that appeal to payo maximizing mo- tives may <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> non-economic motives such as altruism, reciprocity, intrinsic motivation and other social preferences, leading to disappointing and sometimes even counter-productive incentive eects. Evidence from behavioral experiments indicates that crowding may take two forms: categorical (the eect on preferences depends only on {{the presence or absence}} of the incentive) or marginal (the eect depends on the extent of the incentive). We extend an earlier contribution to this journal (Bowles and Hwang, 2008) providing a more general framework for the study of optimal <b>incentives</b> when <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> results from framing and information eects including (with evidence for) categorical crowding, and as a result, an expanded range of situations for which the sophisticated planner will make greater use of <b>incentives</b> when <b>incentives</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> social preferences than when motivational crowding is absent.

We consider repeated trust game experiments to study the interplay between explicit and relational incentives.

Theory predicts that subjects will choose the payoff dominated game (representing a bad explicit contract), because this game better sustains (implicit) relational incentives backed by either reputational or reciprocity considerations.

Given recent interest in theories of reciprocity and intrinsic motivation and their implications for effort provision, the neoclassical prediction seems less obvious today.

On average, people work considerably harder than the minimum but they do not respond to changes in the wage. Second, pooling the data is deceptive because there seem to be distinct types with differing responses to the wage.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} how monetary incentive schemes influence promotion and distribution {{decisions in the}} presence of favoritism. In chapter 2, we theoretically analyze the relationship between managerial incentives and promotion quality {{in the presence of}} favoritism, stating that <b>incentives</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> favoritism and lead to better promotion decisions. Testing this hypothesis empirically, we find a positive relationship between the use of managerial incentives and promotion quality in German firms. In chapter 3, we point out a drawback of high promotion prizes in tournaments with favoritism: In the presence of favoritism supervisors gain utility by awarding the tournament prize to their favored agent and are less likely to promote the more able agent. For large prizes, this effect outweighs the incentive effect of the tournament prize. Consequently, the agents' effort declines in the prize. In chapter 4, we experimentally investigate favoritism-induced selection effects by forming 3 -person groups with two friends and an anonymous player in a distribution game. Anonymous players avoid the distribution game, fearing harmful collaborations of the befriended participants. Incentives for decision-makers partially <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> favoritism and the anonymous player enters the distribution game.

40|$|Over {{the past}} four years {{gamification}} (the use of game elements in non-game contexts) has been implemented in various organisational contexts to drive performance outcomes, with varying degrees of success. One reason for this is the lack of research on the individual game elements and their underlying motivational mechanisms. Further to this gamification, makes use of extrinsic incentives, such as points and levels, to drive intrinsically motivated behaviours, which lead to performance gains in quality. Up until recently it has been widely accepted that extrinsic <b>incentives</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> intrinsic motivation for interesting tasks, which has led to a further lack of research on intrinsic motivation, incentives and performance. What has been proposed is that if the incentives are perceived by the user as informative and not controlling, they may support intrinsic motivation, by enhancing the feeling of competence. It has been said that extrinsic motivation leads to an increase in performance quantity whilst intrinsic motivation leads to an increase in performance quality. This research made use of an online experiment to individually assess the effect of points, levels and leaderboards, against a control condition, on intrinsic motivation, flow and performance quality outcomes (point scores for correctly completed tasks), using graphical perception tasks. The tasks were structured {{in a way that is}} intrinsically motivating to the user, in that they offered performance feedback which allowed for task mastery. The study found that the points and leaderboards conditions had no significant effect on intrinsic motivation, flow or performance quality. The levels condition however led to a significant increase in performance quality, where intrinsic motivation and more specifically, perceived competence predicted the performance quality. This shows that the levels incentive supported intrinsic motivation, and its associated behavioural outcomes.

In the economic literature, evidence for undermining effects exists for a broader variety of behaviors, in settings that involve a conflict of interest between parties. By contrast, for health related behaviors, baseline levels of incentivized behaviors are usually low, and only a subset involve an interpersonal conflict of interest. Correspondingly, we find no evidence for <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> of incentivized health behaviors.

40|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the environment}} is largely a public good. Contributing to a public good is costly to an individual, while the benefits are enjoyed by all. Despite this, many people voluntarily contribute to public goods, both in laboratory economic experiments and through day-to-day environmental decisions. These voluntary contributions are largely motivated intrinsically, that is satisfaction comes from the act itself rather than external rewards. Policy interventions are often required to increase the provision of public goods to the socially optimal level, which usually {{take the form of}} extrinsic incentives such as payments or regulations. Theoretical and empirical evidence from psychology and economics suggests that such extrinsic <b>incentives</b> can <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> the intrinsic motivations which underlie voluntary contributions. As a result, a policy may have less than the anticipated impact. It is even possible for a costly policy intervention to lead to a decrease in overall public good provision, as individuals cease to contribute voluntarily. This paper argues that environmental policy design should proceed with caution in the presence of intrinsic motivations. Weak regulations and small, competitive financial incentives have the greatest potential for negative effects. Recognising and supporting existing efforts can crowd in, rather than <b>crowd</b> <b>out,</b> voluntary contributions.

40|$|How {{reversible}} are incentive systems? – Can firms {{revert to}} “trust and reciprocity ” after practicing “pay for performance”? – These questions highlight the motivation underlying our work here. It is fashionable nowadays for firms to establish performance based pay systems. There {{seems to be}} a common understanding among business people that incentive contracts are essential in order to get employees to well-behave. This view is in line with the purely economic view of man, but it is challenged by the idea that monetary <b>incentives</b> may <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> intrinsic motivation, an idea that has been put forward by social psychologists and, more recently, a few economists. Intrinsic motivation of employees can not be directly observed. However it has been shown in laboratory experiments on principal-agent games that economic efforts of participants may be well above the levels that are economically rational. Thus, there is over-provision of effort by agents, which may be seen as indirect evidence of intrinsic motivation and which we refer to as “voluntary cooperation”. We replicate and extend this line of research by investigating whether voluntary cooperation is affected by incentive contracting in the short run and in the long run. Our main question is whether voluntary cooperation can be re-established after experiencing incentive pay for some time. We find that voluntary cooperation is much smaller after experiencing incentive pay and refer to this effect as <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> in a dynamic sense. Furthermore, the positive correlation between payment and voluntary cooperation, which can be interpreted as reciprocity, deteriorates.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained essays at the nexus of applied microeconomics, behavioural economics, and environmental economics. In the essays of the thesis, I use field experiments and econometric tools to {{examine the impact of}} monetary and non monetary incentives for behavioural change during resource scarcity. I use methods of eliciting intrinsic motivations and then empirically test theories on the interaction of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic incentives. Specifically I analyse whether and which incentives undermine, support, or are independent of existing preferences, and whether incentives change behaviour. The first two essays analyse two distinct types of conservation policy in Brazil: i) direct payments from the state of São Paulo to small landholders living in vulnerable ecosystems conditional on the landholders conserving their land; and, ii) federal policy to regulate, monitor and enforce land use in the Brazilian Amazon through conservation zoning and creation of a public list of municipalities with high rates of deforestation (“priority municipalities”) to increase visibility and thus accountability. The first essay¹ uses a field experiment in Brazil to test if monetary incentives to conserve land on private property in vulnerable ecosystems - “Payments for Environmental Services” (PES) - <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> demand for a conservation program. Landholders are less likely to accept the higher monetary offers to conserve compared to the lowest offers. Given that the rational choice model does not explain the role of incentives in shaping demand for PES, we then look at the interaction of the randomised incentive offers and individuals’ initial intrinsic motivations. We construct methods to elicit social preferences in order to analyse this interaction. We find that, while high monetary <b>incentives</b> <b>crowd</b> in demand of progovernment landholders, they <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> demand of pro-environment (henceforth “proenvironment”) and prosocial landholders. The second essay² combines satellite data on deforestation with data on the location and timing of the conservation zones in Brazil to estimate the effect of conservation zoning on deforestation in the period 2004 - 2010. We provide spatial regression discontinuity estimates and difference-in-difference estimates to show that the policy does not explain the large reduction in deforestation rates during this period. We provide evidence that zones reduce deforestation in municipalities put on a federal government “shame” list for high deforestation rates. The last two essays³ test behavioural interventions to decrease residential water consumption across the City of Cape Town in South Africa as complements to tariff increases and water restrictions during a severe water crisis. Using inserts in monthly municipal bills, we test multiple behavioural messages in a randomised control trial on the full population of free standing domestic households (400 000 +). The treatments are classified into five groups: information provision and increased salience on the tariff structure, financial savings, appeals to the public good, social comparison, and social recognition. By using a number of different framings, the third essay focuses on identifying which incentives best motivate individuals of different income levels to reduce their consumption. We find that lower income households respond only to financial incentives, whereas the higher income households respond only to social incentives and appeals to their intrinsic motivation. In the final essay, we further explore the drivers behind the effect of social recognition on pro-environmental behaviour (henceforth “proenvironment behaviour”). According to Bénabou and Tirole (2006), the visibility of doing-good may create doubt to others as to the true motive of the individual and result in a <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> of prosocial behaviour. We use three treatments within the larger randomised control trial to disentangle intrinsic motivation, extrinsic incentives, and image motivation. We exogenously vary the visibility of the social recognition treatments to test whether i) social recognition <b>incentives</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> intrinsic motivation and, ii) whether social recognition increases the noise of the prosocial signal and ultimately <b>crowds</b> <b>out</b> cooperation. We find, on average, using image motivation as an extrinsic <b>incentive</b> <b>crowds</b> in cooperation. Social recognition with an explicit opt-out has, on average, no effect on consumption. Thus, in our setting, the signal of social recognition for prosocial behaviour is strong enough to elicit cooperation. In application to public policy, our findings suggest public recognition can be used as an adjunct to more traditional demand side management tools, such as water restrictions and tariff increases to achieve additional conservation in the higher income households. To our knowledge, this empirical analysis has not been executed elsewhere and contributes both to the academic literature as well as policy recommendations for alternatives to traditional demand side management tools during times of resource scarcity. ¹Co-authors: Florence Kondylis, Development Research Group, World Bank; Astrid Zwager, Development Research Group, World Bank. ²Co-authors: Liana O.

40|$|A {{substantial}} body {{of research}} investigates the design of incentives in firms, yet less is known about incentives in organizations that hire individuals to perform tasks with positive social spillovers. We conduct a field experiment in which agents hired by a public health organization are randomly allocated to four groups. Agents {{in the control group}} receive a standard volunteer contract often offered for this type of task, whereas agents in the three treatment groups receive small financial rewards, large financial rewards, and non-financial rewards, respectively. The analysis yields three main findings. First, non-financial rewards are more effective at eliciting effort than either financial rewards or the volunteer contract. The effect of financial rewards, both large and small, is much smaller and not significantly different from zero. Second, non-financial rewards elicit effort both by leveraging intrinsic motivation for the cause and by facilitating social comparison among agents. Third, contrary to existing laboratory evidence, financial <b>incentives</b> do not <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> intrinsic motivation in this setting...|$|R
