5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> is an {{alternative}} fuel automobile or light duty truck with a multifuel engine that can use more than one fuel, usually mixed in the same tank, and the blend is burned in the combustion chamber together. These vehicles are colloquially called flex-fuel, or flexifuel in Europe, or just flex in Brazil. FFVs are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks. The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with the major markets concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Sweden, and some other European countries. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol, in the US and Europe there were successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 FFVs, and more recently there have been also successful tests using p-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public.|$|E

Several dual-fuel propulsion concepts were investigated. These include: a separate engine concept combining Russian RD- 170 kerosene-fueled engines with SSME-derivative engines; the kerosene and hydrogen-fueled Russian RD- 701 engine concept; and a dual-fuel, dual-expander engine concept. Analysis to determine vehicle weight and size characteristics was performed using conceptual level design techniques.

5000|$|For {{the fuel}} economy {{calculation}} for alternative fuel vehicles, {{a gallon of}} alternative fuel is deemed to contain 15% fuel (which is approximately the amount of gasoline in a gallon of E85) as an incentive to develop alternative fuel vehicles. The mileage for <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as E85 capable models and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, is computed as the average of its alternative fuel rating—divided by 0.15 (equal to multiplying by 6.666) -- and its gasoline rating. Thus an E85-capable vehicle that gets 15 mpg on E-85 and 25 mpg on gasoline might logically be rated at 20 mpg. But in fact the average, for CAFE purposes, despite perhaps only {{one percent of the}} fuel used in E85-capable vehicles is actually E85, is computed as 100 mpg for E-85 and the standard 25 mpg for gasoline, or 62.5 mpg. However, the total increase in a manufacturer's average fuel economy rating due to <b>dual-fueled</b> <b>vehicles</b> cannot exceed 1.2mpg. [...] Section 32906 reduces the increase due to <b>dual-fueled</b> <b>vehicles</b> to 0 through 2020. Electric vehicles are also incentivized by the 0.15 fuel divisor, but are not subject to the 1.2 mpg cap like <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

The alternative fuel vehicles we consider are liquid propane gas and electric powered vehicles {{in addition to a}} <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In this survey each respondent, in a randomly selected sample, was exposed to 15 experiments. In each experiment the respondent is asked to rank three hypothetical vehicles characterized by specified attributes, according to the respondent's preferences.

40|$|As much of {{the world}} goes searching for {{alternative}} sources of energy to oil, Brazil's three-decade experience in developing a successful substitute for gasoline merits attention. Brazil is the only sizable economy to date to have developed a ubiquitously distributed alternative to oil-based fuels in road transportation: ethanol from sugarcane. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the uptake of flexible-fuel (<b>dual-fuel)</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology has been tremendous. We provide a stylized model of the vertical sugar industry which incorporates arbitrage by producers, across domestic and export markets for ethanol and sugar, and arbitrage by consumers, across ethanol and gasoline at the pump. We show that the model stands up well to the empirical covariation in prices over 30 years. In particular, owing to the increasing penetration of flexible-fuel vehicles, consumer arbitrage is tying the retail price of ethanol to that of gasoline. Of relevance to the current food-versus-fuel 9 ̆ 4 debate, the outward shift of the ethanol demand curve, at price levels where traditional gasoline consumers arbitrage, may lead to higher sugar prices, thanks to substitution in demand (gasoline and ethanol) and in supply (sugar and ethanol) ...|$|E

40|$|Measures must be {{undertaken}} {{to lower the}} transport sector’s contribution to anthropogenic emissions. Vehicles powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are an option due to their reduced emissions of air pollutants compared to engines with conventional fuels. In the present study, ten different dual-fuel LPG/gasoline light duty vehicles were tested, which all complied with European emission level legislation EURO- 4. Tests with LPG and gasoline were performed on a chassis dynamometer by applying the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and emission factors and ozone formation potentials of both kinds of fuels were compared. The components investigated comprised regulated compounds, CO 2, volatile hydrocarbons and carbonyls. On-line analysis of aromatic species {{was carried out by}} resonance enhanced multiphoton ionizatione time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPIeTOFMS). We demonstrate that utilization of LPG can entail some environmental benefits by reducing emissions. However, for <b>dual-fuel</b> LPG/gasoline <b>vehicles</b> running on LPG the benefits are less than expected. The main reason is that <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> usually start the engine up on gasoline even when LPG is selected as fuel. This cold-start phase is crucial for the quality of the emissions. Moreover, we demonstrate an influence on the chemical composition of emissions of vehicle performance, fuel and the evaporative emission system of the vehicles. JRC. DDG.

25|$|Ford has {{expanded}} its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel <b>vehicles,</b> and <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Flexible fuel vehicles can operate {{on a range of}} fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.|$|R

40|$|Consequences of {{consuming}} petroleum in transportation-e. g., air pollution, global warming, energy insecurity-have stimulated interest in alternative automotive fuels and in vehicles that can use multiple fuels and combinations of fuels. Consumer behavior in choosing motor fuels for flexible- or <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{will likely be}} {{a key factor in}} creating and maintaining stable markets for new fuels. This paper explores the implications of recent studies on the sensitivity of choice of gasoline grade to price. It analyzes natural gas vehicle owners' refueling behavior, based on a survey of natural gas vehicles in Canada. The paper uses statistical models to estimate the importance of performance, range, refueling convenience, and other factors in the fuel choice decision. Choice of gasoline grade is highly sensitive to fuel prices. The cost advantage of natural gas also is of paramount importance for natural gas users. However, refueling convenience is essential for overall satisfaction and is {{a major factor in the}} frequency of natural gas use. Alternative fuels not only must be cost competitive with gasoline but initially will require a cost advantage so as to overcome range limitations and refueling inconvenience.
