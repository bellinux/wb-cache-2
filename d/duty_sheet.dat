This will {{be achieved by}} the ANC's commitment too promotion ofhealth through prevention and education. The Primary Health Care approach is the tenet for the restructuring ofthe health system. To {{be able to create}} a Health System which is single, comprehensive, equitable and integrated the system should be accessible, effective, acceptable, affordable and just. Community health nursing should be restructured to comply with these conditions. In this study the functions ofthe district nurse as a component ofthe Community Health Nursing Service within the National Health System is described. The aim ofthis study is to render more prominence to the promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitive aspects ofcommunity health nursing in the home environment. Criteria for the delivery ofa district nursing service as component ofa community health nursing service will also be set and the position ofcurrent district nursing services investigated. An explorative, descriptive study was performed. The functions that the district nurse is supposed to perform will be obtained, by analysing <b>duty</b> <b>sheets,</b> a questionnaire and a literature review, to set guide lines for the delivery ofa district nursing service. Most ofthe district nurse's functions were found to be corresponding, in the <b>duty</b> <b>sheets</b> and questionnaires. But there were also some differences. The final findings are describe...|$|R

More prominence {{should be given to}} the function of the community nurse in these mainly curative health services. An explorative and descriptive study was performed in order to explore and describe the functions of the community nurse {{in the context of the}} district health service in South Africa. These functions described in this article were determined by means of an analysis of <b>duty</b> <b>sheets</b> as well as the use of questionnaires which was based on a literature study.

2500|$|At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an {{off-road}} motorcyclist spotted what {{he initially}} described as [...] "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" [...] in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw. As he approached he realised {{that it was}} actually a corpse. In his subsequent testimony he explained: [...] "At first I thought it was a mannequin and what struck me was the leg, possibly the left leg. I could see bone there. Tailor's dummies don't have bones." [...] The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female. [...] He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which Detective Sergeant (DS) Clifford Neil of Strathclyde Police described as [...] "gruesome." [...] The body lay on a makeshift pyre and had heavy <b>duty</b> plastic <b>sheet</b> partly melted on to the facial area. Strathclyde Police launched a murder inquiry, led by Detective Superintendent (D/Supt) Derek Robertson of the force's Major Investigation Unit, on 24 May following the results of a post-mortem examination.|$|R
500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, {{and what happened to}} it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a <b>duty</b> manager's action <b>sheet</b> not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|R
