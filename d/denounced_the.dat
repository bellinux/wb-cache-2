5|$|The decision, while widely {{praised by}} foreign intellectuals and politicians, was {{attacked}} by the Chinese government and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> award and what they regarded as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China—on the Internet, television, and in print media. The government strongly <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> award, and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest. The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate. Liu's wife was put under house-arrest before {{the decision of the}} Nobel Committee was announced.|$|E

50|$|In Article 19 of Part 5, <b>the</b> {{process of}} <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> Convention is laid out. Countries {{are allowed to}} <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Convention only under certain circumstances. The article states that a country may <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Convention if they wish, only {{ten years after the}} Convention first came into force (in 1998). Therefore, in 2008 it was {{possible}} for any ratifying countries to eliminate the Convention and subsequently drop their enforcement of its laws. This would result in a major loss of support for miner’s health and safety, and even basic rights. As a result, no countries have yet to <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Convention.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1989, {{two years}} before the final {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev's government formally <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, acknowledging that the bloody annexation of the Baltic States and the partition of Poland had been illegal.|$|E
50|$|Three councils were held, two by Constantinople, one by Rome. Rome {{attempted}} {{to replace a}} seated Patriarch with one amenable to the Filioque dispute. The Orthodox responded by <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> replacement and excommunicating the pope convening <b>the</b> Roman council, <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> pope's attempt to control affairs outside the purview of Rome, and <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> addition of Filioque as a heresy. Each church recognizes its own council(s) as legitimate and does not recognize the other's council(s).|$|R
50|$|Like much {{political}} or religious {{poetry of the}} Alliterative Revival (i.e., Piers Plowman, Mum and the Sothsegger), the poem {{takes the form of}} a quest for knowledge. It is narrated by a layman who has memorised nearly all of the rudimentary texts demanded by the Fourth Lateran Council. He can read, and is able to recite the Ave Maria and Pater Noster proficiently: yet he does not know the Creed. He seeks help from the friars, first turning to the Franciscans, then the Dominicans, followed by the Austin friars and the Carmelites. But rather than learning anything of value, all he hears are imprecations. Each order savagely attacks one of its rival groups of mendicants: <b>the</b> Franciscans <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Carmelites; <b>the</b> Carmelites <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Dominicans; <b>the</b> Dominicans <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> Augustines; the Augustines complete this carousel of invective by <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> Franciscans. The entire poem seems like an uproarious inversion of cantos xi and xii of Dantes Paradiso: just as Dante has the Dominican Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure lauding one anothers orders, so the Crede-poet makes the mendicants exchange abuse.|$|R

5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte {{rejected}} this support: {{the party}} of independence sought to establish a constitutional monarchy headed by Charlotte, but she preferred to retain the power of an absolutist monarchy. Consequently, she <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> letter and organized the detention of Diego Paroissien. Paroissien, who had several letters to the criollos, was charged with high treason. Castelli was his lawyer.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, Milošević {{condemned}} the Croatian attack, but the Milošević-influenced press also <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> {{leadership of the}} RSK as being incompetent, while the most extreme politicians, including Vojislav Šešelj, demanded retaliation against Croatia. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić begged for the Yugoslav Army to help while accusing Milošević of treason.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> election of Abraham Lincoln and his {{use of military force}} to subdue the southern states. Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E

5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people of Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery.

5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany.

The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously <b>denounced</b> <b>the</b> 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
