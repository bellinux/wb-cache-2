5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976. In 1978 the National Council decided in a <b>half-step</b> backwards that Wood Badge needed to place {{greater emphasis on}} the practical aspects of good troop operation along {{with a variety of}} leadership exercises. Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a <b>half-step</b> down from standard tuning.|$|E
25|$|When four-valved models {{without any}} kind of {{compensation}} play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a <b>half-step</b> below the one {{they are trying to}} play. This eliminates the note a <b>half-step</b> above their open fundamental.|$|E

5000|$|Typical of 20th-century music, {{the piece}} uses mixed meter, {{in this case}} {{beginning}} in 5/2 then shifting for a measure to 3/2 with a steady pulse of half-note = 88. Within such a fluid meter Lutosławski begins by presenting the principal twelve-tone idea horizontally and unambiguously in the first cello F↑B↓B↑E↓E↓A↓A↑D↓D↓G↓G↑C. Significantly, the twelve-tone row consists of only two intervals: tritones and (descending) <b>half-steps</b> [...] Both of these intervals are associated with lament and funeral topics. Lutosławski initially treats the row canonically, answering this dux with a comes in the second cello, whose time interval is one beat (half-note) and pitch interval is six <b>half-steps</b> higher.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} chainrings with <b>half-step</b> {{differences}} between the larger two and multi-range {{differences between the}} smaller two, e.g. chainrings 24-42-46 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36. This general arrangement is suitable for touring with most gear changes being made using the rear derailleur and occasional fine tuning using the two large chainrings. The small chainring (granny gear) is a bailout for handling steeper hills, but it requires some anticipation {{in order to use}} it effectively.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} entire second movement, {{one of the most}} Mahlerian moments appears {{at the outset of the}} third movement—a funeral march {{reminiscent}} of many similar passages in the Austrian's output. Another such point occurs near the beginning of the deeply brooding coda that follows the last full-orchestra outburst, with the descending <b>half-step</b> idea in the woodwinds clearly pointing to the A Major-to-A minor chord progression that characterizes much of Mahler's Sixth Symphony.|$|E
25|$|The jab is {{recognized}} {{as the most important}} punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A <b>half-step</b> may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or 'wear down' their opponents to some effect include Larry Holmes and Wladimir Klitschko.|$|E
50|$|The four-stringed requinto jarocho {{can follow}} the {{standard}} tuning of (ADGc), but is also commonly tuned to GADg and CDGc. The five-stringed requinto, however, adds a string above the standard tuning 5 <b>half-steps</b> below the initial first string, making it EADGc.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} Anton Webern is often palindromic. Webern, {{who had studied}} {{the music of the}} Renaissance {{composer}} Heinrich Isaac, was extremely interested in symmetries in music, be they horizontal or vertical. An example of horizontal or linear symmetry in Webern's music is the first phrase in the second movement of the symphony, Op. 21. A striking example of vertical symmetry is the second movement of the Piano Variations, Op. 27, in which Webern arranges every pitch of this dodecaphonic work around the central pitch axis of A4. From this, each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction. For example, a G3—13 <b>half-steps</b> down from A4 is replicated as a B5—13 <b>half-steps</b> above.|$|R
5000|$|For example, one {{can find}} the {{frequency}} of C5, the first C above A4. There are 3 <b>half-steps</b> between A4 and C5 (A4 → A4 → B4 → C5), and the note is above A4, so n = 3. The note's frequency is: ...|$|R
500|$|Panitan Wattanayagorn, a {{military}} scholar at Chulalongkorn University {{and a personal}} adviser to Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont noted in early September 2007 that [...] "if the army {{is going to take}} a full step into politics, then it will be Saprang. If only a <b>half-step,</b> then Anupong. And if it intends to beat a full retreat or take one step back, it will be [...] Montri [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Today" [...] {{is written}} in the key of E-flat major (E) and played in {{standard}} tuning. While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a <b>half-step</b> and playing the song {{as if it were}} in the key of E, he said, [...] "There was something about the E voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." [...] "Today" [...] is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan [...] "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tonight, Tonight" [...] {{is written}} in the key of G, {{performed}} on instruments tuned down a <b>half-step</b> so the actual pitch is G. In the original recording sessions, [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] was initially written in the key of C instead of G. However, since Corgan was unable to sing the song in C, he wrote a version during the Mellon Collie recording sessions to suit his range. The strings for the song were arranged by Billy Corgan & Audrey Riley, and recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Corgan said that recording with a 30-piece string-section for the song [...] "was {{probably one of the}} most exciting recording experiences I have ever had." ...|$|E

The descending minor scale shown has the same order of half steps and whole steps as the ascending major scale.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{many other}} songs by Goo Goo Dolls, [...] "Black Balloon" [...] uses an unusual {{alternate}} tuning. Several electric guitars {{used in the}} introduction and the acoustic rhythm guitar are tuned to an open D-flat fifth chord. It was <b>half-stepped</b> on the album version.|$|R
40|$|New {{software}} for chordal evaluation of MIDI files with complex harmonic features represents a significant advance over earlier procedures for automated assessment {{used in our}} academy. The new software, built on generalized foundations of music-theory teaching derived from German, American, Slovak, and Czech sources, treats triads and tetrads (here called “sevenths”) as collections of thirds which are either major (four <b>half-steps)</b> or minor (three <b>half-steps).</b> The software assesses cumulative durations of pitches and chord-classes after iterative evaluation of all the notes within each beat-space. Our approach to tonal theory maps easily onto MIDI key numbers. Chordal identifications are displayed underneath each system in screen no-tation. We have tested our routines on roughly eight dozen keyboard movements by Mozart, Schubert, and Brahms...|$|R
500|$|All guitars on {{the album}} were tuned down a <b>half-step</b> in order to [...] "make the music a little lower", {{according}} to Corgan. On some songs, like [...] "Jellybelly", the first string was tuned down an additional whole step to C (referred to by Corgan as [...] "the 'grunge tuning'"). There was a greater variety {{to the number of}} guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, [...] "n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn't really the train of thought this time, although we did that too." [...] "To Forgive" [...] consists of only one live guitar take, while [...] "Thru the Eyes of Ruby" [...] contains approximately 70guitar tracks. The various sections of [...] "Porcelina of the Vast Oceans" [...] were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools. Corgan and Iha shared soloing duties; Iha estimated that the guitar solo duties were divided [...] "half and half" [...] on the record.|$|E
500|$|Kariya {{was known}} for his skilled and {{entertaining}} style of play. An offensive player, he was a fast skater with strong puck-handling and passing abilities. Prior to and early in his NHL career, Kariya drew comparisons to Wayne Gretzky. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, American Head Coach Tim Taylor likened his skating and playmaking ability to Gretzky's, while Kariya's linemate, Chris Kontos, described his on-ice vision as [...] "Gretzky-like." [...] Canadian Head Coach Tom Renney heralded him as [...] "think and play at a better speed than anybody else," [...] adding that his teammates [...] "are usually a <b>half-step</b> behind him." [...] His speed made him particularly adept in international competition, as games were played on a larger ice surface in comparison to the NHL. Following his first NHL goal against Winnipeg, Jets Head Coach John Paddock told reporters, [...] "like with Gretzky the puck seems to following him around... It looks like he's cherry-picking, but he's not. That's just great instinct." [...] Kariya himself cited Gretzky, as well as Brett Hull, Jeremy Roenick and Pavel Bure as players he liked patterning his game after. Kariya was also recognized for his [...] "hockey sense" [...] and the cerebral aspect of his game, which included analyzing the game at a high level. His first NHL coach, Ron Wilson, also once described Kariya as [...] "the hardest-working athlete [...] ever been associated with." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot {{was more}} {{critical}}. He called it [...] "a clone of the original", and criticised {{the lack of}} split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from Edge; he described the game as [...] "virtually indistinguishable" [...] from the first Ridge Racer, and commented that Ridge Racer Revolution does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that {{it is simply a}} [...] "jazzed-up" [...] Ridge Racer 2, and [...] the visuals were criticised as [...] "antiquated". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as [...] "varied". A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the original Ridge Racer was rushed {{in order to make it}} out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with Virtua Fighter Remix, [...] "Namco has simply released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be [...] "a <b>half-step</b> away from being conned". Will Groves of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the game as [...] "a poor sequel", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as [...] "great", but further criticised it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.|$|E
50|$|When <b>half-stepping,</b> {{the drive}} {{alternates}} between two phases on {{and a single}} phase on. This increases the angular resolution. The motor also has less torque (approx 70%) at the full-step position (where only a single phase is on). This may be mitigated by increasing the current in the active winding to compensate. The advantage of half stepping is that the drive electronics need not change to support it. In animated figure shown above, if we change it to <b>half-stepping,</b> then it will take 8 steps to rotate by 1 teeth position. So there will be 25×8 = 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 = 1.8°. Its angle per step is half of the full step.|$|R
5000|$|... "One day I was <b>half-stepping,</b> and {{the lights}} went out," [...] Dylan would recall ten years later. [...] "And since that point, I more or less had amnesia… It {{took me a long}} time to get to do {{consciously}} what I used to be able to do unconsciously." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Mad Scene", [...] "", has {{historically}} been a vehicle for several coloratura sopranos (providing a breakthrough for Dame Joan Sutherland) and is a technically and expressively demanding piece. Donizetti wrote it in F major, but it is often transposed down a tone (two <b>half-steps)</b> into E-flat.|$|R
2500|$|Taylor W65 12-string (Tuned down <b>half-step</b> for [...] "The Last Stop" [...] in 2016; {{previously}} {{used for}} all 12-string songs prior to 2015: [...] "Grey Street" [...] "Raven" [...] "Bartender" [...] "Sweet Up and Down" [...] "Kit Kat Jam" [...] "JTR" [...] "Big Eyed Fish") ...|$|E
2500|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} express other exposure ratios {{in terms}} of 'stops'. Ignoring the f-number markings, the f-stops make a logarithmic scale of exposure intensity. Given this interpretation, one can then think of taking a <b>half-step</b> along this scale, to make an exposure difference of [...] "half a stop".|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Richmond {{failed to}} qualify for the finals {{for the first time in}} four years. Following a {{comprehensive}} Round 3 loss to Adelaide, coach Hardwick said the team would have to [...] "take a little <b>half-step</b> back to go two steps forward." [...] It would go on to be the story of the season with several major defeats including one against Greater Western Sydney in which Richmond registered its lowest score since 1961. The club debuted six players and brought in two recruits for their first games in the yellow and black.|$|E
5000|$|To {{find the}} {{frequency}} of a note below A4, the value of n is negative. For example, the F below A4 is F4. There are 4 <b>half-steps</b> (A4 → A4 → G4 → G4 → F4), and the note is below A4, so n = −4. The note's frequency is: ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{the battle}} scenes, {{intended}} to be a highlight of the series with significant numbers of soldiers presented, oddly and inaccurately show soldiers advancing slowly in short <b>half-steps</b> when in reality they marched at full stride.

2500|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered trombones today are the tenor and bass, though {{as with many}} other Renaissance instruments, the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide {{that is used to}} change the pitch. [...] Valve trombones use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a <b>half-step,</b> and the third valve by one and a half steps.|$|E
2500|$|One {{standard}} {{option for the}} Brompton folding bicycle {{is to use a}} 3-speed hub gear (roughly a 30% difference between gear ratios) in combination with a 2-speed deraileur gear (roughly a 15% difference) to give 6 distinct gear ratios; {{this is an example of}} <b>half-step</b> gearing. [...] Some Brompton suppliers offer a 2-speed chainring 'Mountain Drive' as well, which results in 12 distinct gear ratios with a range exceeding 5:1; in this case, the change from 6th to 7th gear involves changing all three sets of gears simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional tuning (low to high) is C-E-A-D, but modern players {{frequently}} tune D-G-B-E (like the {{top four}} strings of the standard guitar). [...] Today's Colombian tiple is considered a concert pitch instrument (tuned in the key of 'C'). However, sometimes tuning the higher octave of the second course to B4 is problematic (e.g., strings break), and the instrument may be tuned a <b>half-step</b> or a whole-step lower. [...] It may then be played with a capo on {{the first or second}} fret to bring it back up to concert pitch, or the player may adjust their fingerings accordingly. [...] The instrument is notated, like the guitar, one octave higher than the actual sound.|$|E
50|$|The Persian {{scale is}} a musical scale {{occasionally}} found in guitar scale books, along other scales inspired by Middle Eastern music. It {{is characterized by}} the liberal use of half steps (4), augmented seconds (2), and frequent use of chromaticism. Compare this to the one augmented second of the harmonic minor or the use of only two <b>half-steps</b> in all diatonic scales. This is also the Locrian mode with a major third and major seventh degree.|$|R
50|$|Sonata (1959-1960) for piano was {{performed}} at the first ONCE Festival and explores changing rhythmic densities. Ashley’s goal was to create “a kind of ‘kaleidoscope’ of very rapidly changing ‘harmonies.’” The music uses a 36-note row {{with a combination of}} <b>half-steps</b> and whole-steps that produces dissonant sounds for any combination of pitches. The length of the phrases, instead of relying on melody or harmony, is determined by how long a note on the piano could be sustained, with or without pedal.|$|R
5000|$|The oratorio's {{striking}} drama, power, and coherence {{derive from}} Seter's mastery of polyphonic technique, his sure and original orchestration, and his consistent use—with expert balance between repetition and variation—of an intricately linked network of musical materials. These include (1) a [...] "lament" [...] motive, {{consisting of a}} descending minor second; (2) a [...] "hope" [...] motive, consisting of an ascending major second; (3) a twelve-note scale consisting exclusively of <b>half-steps</b> and augmented seconds; and (4) the Yemenite paraliturgical melodies Ahavat hadasa and Elohim esh 'ala.|$|R
