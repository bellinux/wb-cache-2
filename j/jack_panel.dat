Each operator {{sat in front of}} a vertical panel containing banks of ¼-inch tip-ring-sleeve (3-conductor) jacks, each of which was the local termination of a subscriber's telephone line. In front of the <b>jack</b> <b>panel</b> lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of patch cords, each pair connected to a cord circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Colossus {{was not a}} {{stored program}} computer. The input data for the five {{parallel}} processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the chi, psi and motor wheels. The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and <b>jack</b> <b>panel</b> connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display {{the number of times}} it yielded the specified value of [...] "false" [...] (0) or [...] "true" [...] (1) for each pass of the message tape.|$|E

40|$|Here {{are some}} {{practical}} tips for making simple test accessories {{to use at}} your engineering workbench: filters, detectors, attenuators and return loss bridges for audio and RF/IF Every engineering lab bench needs a supply of handy test accessories—cables, adapters, attenuators, couplers, combiners, filters, detectors, limiters, etc. This article describes several accessories that can be built quickly (and cheaply), yet they provide sufficient performance from DC to 100 MHz. This frequency range includes most audio, baseband and intermediate frequency circuits, {{as well as many}} RF applications from VLF through VHF. Connector-Mounted Accessories Low cost tests pieces can be realized using BNC <b>panel</b> <b>jacks</b> and associated hardware, although improvements can be attained using UHF connectors and <b>panel</b> <b>jacks,</b> as well as the higher quality N and TNC connectors. SMA and similar microwave connectors can certainly be used, but most hand-built circuits will not require their microwave performance. Low cost test pieces can be constructed readily, via machine screw and solder assembly, using four hole coaxial <b>panel</b> <b>jacks</b> without printed circuit boards or enclosures. This technique has been demonstrated for passive circuits using BNC connectors [1], and UHF connectors have been extensively used with low cost transmission line transformers [2]...|$|R

5000|$|A {{shocking}} twist {{from the}} fourth episode was the detonation of a suitcase nuke that killed twelve thousand civilians. The subsequent episodes, however, hardly showed any of the panic that would result from this. David Fury explained the development {{by saying that the}} intended writing direction kept fluctuating. [...] "In the early seasons of 24, writers tried to map out stories and arc out stories beforehand {{a little bit more than}} they did, say, in seasons four and five, and four and five turned out to be two of most successful seasons." [...] The nuclear threat was defused before the end of the season, leading to a story that was more personal for <b>Jack.</b> A <b>panel</b> of writers at Comic-Con said that they originally planned for Tony Almeida to return in the sixth-season finale.|$|R
5000|$|Quarter-inch phone {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to connect external processing devices to mixing consoles' insert points (see Insert (effects processing)). Two- or three-conductor phone connectors might be used in pairs as separate send and return jacks, or a single three-conductor phone jack might be employed for both send and return, {{in which case the}} signals are unbalanced. The one unbalanced combination send/return TRS insert <b>jack</b> saves both <b>panel</b> space and component complexity, but may introduce a slight buzz. Insert points on mixing consoles may also be XLR, RCA or bantam TT (tiny telephone) jacks, depending on the make and model.|$|R
5000|$|The TX had a 3.5" [...] {{internal}} {{floppy disk}} drive mounted in a 5.25" [...] bay with room for an optional second internal 3.5" [...] or 5.25" [...] {{floppy disk drive}}. It had ports for two joysticks in the front panel which included a volume control and an -inch headphone <b>jack.</b> The rear <b>panel</b> had the same ports as the 1000 SX except that an RS-232C serial port replaced the light-pen port. The memory size was 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to video frame buffering. The computer came bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.|$|R
50|$|In the AC'97 design, {{the audio}} output {{is sent to}} the jack. If the {{headphones}} are not plugged in, the jack directs the audio to the return pins that are connected to the speakers. When a headphone is plugged into the front <b>panel</b> <b>jack,</b> the audio signal goes to the headphones; the return pins are disconnected, so no audio signal goes to the speakers. For the microphone jack, the return signal pins ground the microphone input when the microphone is not plugged in. Many motherboards with AC'97 audio need two jumpers to short the pins in case no front panel audio module is connected.|$|R
5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{technical}} control facility (TCF) is a telecommunications facility, or a designated and specially configured part thereof, that (a) contains the equipment necessary for ensuring fast, reliable, and secure exchange of information, (b) typically includes distribution frames and associated <b>panels,</b> <b>jacks,</b> and switches and monitoring, test, conditioning, and orderwire equipment, and (c) allows telecommunications systems control personnel to exercise operational {{control of communications}} paths and facilities, make quality analyses of communications and communications channels, [...] operations and maintenance functions, recognize and correct deteriorating conditions, restore disrupted communications, provide requested on-call circuits, and take or direct such actions as may be required and practical to provide effective telecommunications services.|$|R
5000|$|Intel {{warns that}} HDA dongles {{should be used}} with HDA motherboards: It is {{strongly}} recommended that motherboard designers only use Intel HD Audio analog front panel dongles with the Intel HD Audio analog front panel header {{to insure that the}} jack detection and dynamic re-tasking capability is preserved. Passive AC’97 analog front panel dongles (ones which leave the 5V Analog pin-7 line unconnected on the dongle) may be used with the Intel HD Audio analog front panel header. But note that the front <b>panel</b> <b>jack</b> detection and re-tasking functionality will be lost as the AC’97 jacks cannot support connection to the SENSE line. In addition, software must be aware that an AC’97 dongle is being used with an Intel HD Audio analog header since the software might need to dedicate codec ports that are connected to the header to meet the product’s intended functionality.|$|R
40|$|Painting is jewellery… collage is poor,” the French Surrealist poet Louis Aragon once wrote. I {{first came}} across this quote, not in Aragon’s Écrits sur l’art moderne, but in Dick Hebdige’s Subculture: {{the meaning of}} style. While {{targeting}} youth cultures instead of cultural products, Hebdige’s exploration of style “returning to [Jean] Genet’s major themes: the status and meaning of revolt, the idea of style {{as a form of}} Refusal, the elevation of crime into art (even though, in our case, the ‘crimes’ are only broken codes) ” (1988, 2) could be of some use for considering collages in comics due to their de- and re-contextualization of techniques and objects. Although the collage was not mentioned as such in the list of changes Luc Boltanski noted in his only essay on comics, the collage also contributes towards engendering what Boltanski described as difficulty in decoding, a feature which, like individualistic style itself, is usually associated with the higher arts (“La constitution du champ de la bande dessinée,” Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales 1. 1 (1975) : 37 - 59, 50 - 51). Adhering to the basic notion of the collage as a combination of different elements taken from different contexts, this paper will focus on McKean’s comic books combining several media and thereby indulging in a practice that may appear marginal to comics but is in fact a recurrent, if not so blatantly disjointed or allusive, technique (one need only, as Steven Brower recently pointed out, consider <b>Jack</b> Kirby’s collaged <b>panels</b> starting with his outer space Fantastic Four adventures). In considering its transposition to comics, the collage’s affiliation with design, its rebellious entry and eventual canonization in the realm of fine arts, along with its dialectic of authorial presence, will be discussed bearing in mind comics’ marginality in cultural hierarchies and categories...|$|R
