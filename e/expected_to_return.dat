5|$|By July 1943, it {{was decided}} to send a group of 6,000 long serving {{veterans}} of the NZEF to New Zealand for three months leave. Kippenberger was the ranking officer of the group, and with a high public profile due to his exploits in Crete and North Africa, he spent much of his leave in extensive speaking engagements. He became very rundown and was seriously ill in September, when he was originally <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Egypt. He did not return to command the 5th Brigade until November.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who {{had played}} in four matches during the {{competition}} was suspended after being shown a red card in a FA Cup match against Newcastle United.

Captain Steven Gerrard and striker Fernando Morientes were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the starting line-up for Liverpool, while midfielder Xabi Alonso would miss out after breaking his leg in the last fixture between the two sides. Going into the match Chelsea were the favourites with the bookmakers at Even odds to win the match, while Liverpool were 9-4.

5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, {{so there are no}} confirmed observations of comets that are likely to have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E

Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|The AAFC's Baltimore Colts signed Humble in 1947, but the Browns {{acquired}} {{him in a}} trade {{before the}} season.

When the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Cleveland moved to the NFL and won another championship in 1950. Humble, who remained in the Marine Reserves, was called into service in the Korean War after the season. He was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Cleveland the following year, but head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Texans before the 1952 season began.

Pittsburgh received the opening kickoff and drove 75yards to open the scoring with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Mewelde Moore to put the Steelers up 7–0. The Steelers' defense forced the Bengals offense into five consecutive three-and-outs, before the Bengals scored on their final possession of the opening half. The 5-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Chad Johnson brought the Bengals within three points of the Steelers, who added a field goal from Jeff Reed.|$|E

However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E
5|$|David S. Goyer and Zack Snyder are set {{to write}} and direct a sequel to Man of Steel, respectively.

Goyer stated at the Superman 75th Anniversary Panel at 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, that Batman and Superman would face off, and titles under consideration are Superman Vs Batman and Batman Vs Superman. On August 22, 2013, it was announced that Ben Affleck was cast as Batman. On December 4, 2013, it was reported that Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman.|$|E
50|$|Some {{may also}} prefer to hold foreign {{currency}} rather than change it back {{if they are}} <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> where it is used. Companies that frequently send employees abroad may essentially act as their own exchange by reimbursing their employees in the local currency and holding the foreign currency. If exchange rates are relatively stable, the fees charged by a bureau may exceed any likely fluctuation and it also makes the company’s accountancy easier.|$|R

After a record attendance in 2012 – both for a single day (32,953) and the aggregate for the whole weekend (63,716) – the Etihad Stadium became the venue of choice for this annual rugby league event, setting another attendance record (36,339 / 64,552) for it in May 2014. However, the current construction work involved with {{the expansion of the}} South Stand caused this competition to be relocated to St. James' Park for the summer of 2015, but it is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the Etihad again once the expansion work is complete.|$|E
5|$|The German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{an area of}} Yugoslavia roughly corresponding to {{the borders of the}} pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, had been retained under military administration following the April 1941 German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The German military administration supervised a Serbian puppet regime known as the Government of National Salvation, led by the former Yugoslav Minister of War, Milan Nedić. The appointment of a HSSPF had not been planned and this initially accorded with the preferences of the Wehrmacht commander in the territory. A communist-led uprising had erupted in mid-1941 and while it had been brutally suppressed during Operation Uzice in December, it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> in the spring of 1942. To address this, Himmler decided to appoint a HSSPF for the occupied territory, as he considered the existing occupation regime was not being sufficiently harsh with the Serbs. Meyszner was chosen for the new position, despite the fact that few HSSPF were selected from the Orpo. At 55 years old, Meyszner was also the oldest HSSPF appointed.|$|E
5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. Many workers stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to work on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. Nearly one-third of the African-American employees were non-union, and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were {{kept out of the}} stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-union African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main grievance against African Americans was that they were non-union and had been used by management as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
