50|$|The 1902 {{renovation}} {{during the}} Theodore Roosevelt administration dramatically reconfigured the ground floor. Multiple layers of rotting floor boards were removed and new flooring installed. Several new rooms were framed {{and finished with}} a <b>finished</b> <b>plaster</b> <b>coat.</b> A gentlemen's and ladies' lounge and guest bathrooms were created. Charles Follen McKim admired James Hoban's groin vault ceilings in the center hall. The hall was refurbished and the center hall served to connect the new East and West wings. Though the ground floor oval room was much improved and now {{a part of the}} finished living space in the house, it remained primarily a passageway not a destination.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{application of}} stucco and lath occurs in three coats — the scratch coat, the brown <b>coat</b> and the <b>finish</b> <b>coat.</b> The two base <b>coats</b> of <b>plaster</b> are either hand-applied or machine sprayed. The <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> can be troweled smooth, hand-textured, floated to a sand finish or sprayed. Originally the lath material was strips of wood installed horizontally on the wall, with spaces between, that {{would support the}} wet plaster until it cured. This lath and plaster technique became widely used.|$|R
50|$|In three <b>coat</b> <b>plastering</b> it is {{standard}} {{to apply a}} second layer in the same fashion, leaving about a half inch of rough, sandy plaster (called a brown coat or browning (UK)). A smooth, white <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> goes on last. After the plaster is completely dry, the walls are ready to be painted. In this article's photo ("lath seen from the back...") the curls of plaster are called keys and are necessary to keep the plaster on the lath. Traditional lime based mortar/plaster often incorporates horsehair which reinforces the plasterwork, thereby helping to prevent the keys from breaking away.|$|R

50|$|Primer {{coatings}} {{form the}} essential {{link between the}} pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coating.</b> Essentially, a primer is required to provide inter-coat adhesion between the pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> and is also required to promote corrosion resistance in the total system. The composition of the primer will {{vary depending on the}} type of <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> used. Primers require compatibility with various pretreatments and top coat paint systems; therefore, they usually comprise a mixture of resin systems to achieve this end.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} thermal and strain behavior of external thermal insulation cladding systems (ETICS) with Glazed Hollow Beads (GHB) thermal insulation mortar under hygrothermal cycles weather test {{in order to}} measure its durability under extreme weather (i. e., sunlight and rain). Thermometers and strain gauges are placed into different wall layers to gather thermal and strain data and another instrument measures the crack dimensions after every 4 cycles. The results showed that the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> shrank at early stage (elastic deformation) and then the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> tends to expand and become damaged at later stage (plastic deformation). The deformation of insulation layer {{is similar to that of}} the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> but its variation amplitude is smaller. Deformation of substrate expanded with heat and contracted with cold due to the small temperature variation. The length and width of cracks on the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> grew as the experiment progressed but with a decreasing growth rate and the cracks stopped growing around 70 cycles...|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> systems was also studied. These <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. <b>Finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear <b>coat,</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of <b>finish</b> <b>coats,</b> the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R

40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been a lot of {{discussion}} about negative impacts on the environment that are caused by human actions. Climate change, ozone hole, global warming, air pollution are only some of the many negative impacts. In addition, non-renewable energy resources (such as oil, natural gas, coal) are being depleted, causing energy to increasingly become more and more valuable. One of the methods for detection of such negative environmental impacts is the socalled life cycle assessment method or LCA. First part of the master thesis presents the LCA method and with it connected standardization, its characteristics, process and its use in construction industry. It continues with the presentation of the ETICS and its components. The LCA calculation (“from cradle to gate”) using real data and the presentation of the results in form of the environmental product declaration EPD, is carried out for adhesive mortar, <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> and ETICS. Last part of this thesis presents the comparison of the environmental impacts on thermal insulation materials, <b>finishing</b> <b>coats</b> and ETICS. We compared the thermal insulation materials according to the LCA results that were calculated from the databases. For comparison of the <b>finishing</b> <b>coats</b> we used publicly available EPD and the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> we calculated ourselves. Lastly we combined different thermal insulation materials and <b>finishing</b> <b>coats</b> into ETICS, calculated LCA and compared the ETICS. We have found that the only right comparison including declared unit is the one that is based on the function of the material and not on the mass unit of the material. The results vary according to different environmental impact indicators, therefore it is necessary to compare different indicators among themselves. Using LCA we came to a conclusion that the thermal insulation material has the biggest impact on the ETICS in majority of the environmental impact indicators, while the choice of <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> does not play a key role for environmental impact indicators...|$|R

5000|$|A {{protective}} <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> is {{a substance}} or chemical composition {{applied to the}} surface of an object that provides a barrier of protection from external elements. Polishes use a highly refined abrasive (generally finer than 4,000 grit) that is suspended in a liquid carrier. The polish wears away the surface to create a smooth surface. The smoother the surface the higher the resulting gloss or perceived [...] "shine". A protective <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> is applied after polishing to preserve the surface and help resist further oxidation or weathering. Effective finishing coatings penetrate the surface pores and use these pores to which the protective film anchors to.|$|R

Plastering walls with one coat is actually faster than taping since you don't have to wait for three separate coats to dry for 24 hours, as in taping. If heavy patchwork is involved, then yes, there is also await time. However, that is typically for drying time not curing.|$|R
