40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{treats the}} problem of transient scattering of obliquely <b>incident</b> electromagnetic <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> on a stratified anisotropic dielectric slab. Scattering operators are derived for the reflective response of the medium. The internal fields are calculated. Wave splitting and invariant imbedding techniques are used. These techniques are first presented for fields normally incident on a stratified, isotropic dielectric medium. The techniques of wave splitting and invariant imbedding are applied to normally <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> on an anisotropic medium. An integro-differential equation is derived for the reflective response and the direct and inverse scattering problems are discussed. These techniques are applied {{to the case of}} obliquely <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves.</b> The reflective response is derived and the direct and inverse problems discussed and compared to those for the normal incidence case. The internal fields are investigated for the oblique incidence via a Green 2 ̆ 7 s function approach. A numerical scheme is presented to calculate the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. Finally, symmetry relations of the reflective response are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the effects of}} relative motion on the excitation of surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves guided by the planar interface of a metal film and a dielectric slab, both materials being isotropic and homogeneous. Electromagnetic phasors in moving and non-moving reference frames were related directly using the corresponding Lorentz transformations. Our numerical studies revealed that, {{in the case of}} a uniformly moving dielectric slab, the angle of incidence for SPP-wave excitation is highly sensitive to (i) the ratio β of the speed of motion to speed of light in free space and (ii) the direction of motion. When the direction of motion is parallel to the plane of incidence, the SPP wave is excited by p-polarized (but not s-polarized) <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> for low and moderate values of β, while at higher values of β the total reflection regime breaks down. When the direction of motion is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the SPP wave is excited by p-polarized <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> for low values of β, but s-polarized <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> at moderate values of β, while at higher values of β the SPP wave is not excited.

50|$|The {{method is}} based on the Floquet's theorem that the {{solutions}} of periodic differential equations can be expanded with Floquet functions (or sometimes referred as Bloch wave, especially in solid-state physics community). A device is divided into layers that are each uniform in the z direction. A staircase approximation is needed for curved devices with properties such as dielectric permittivity graded along the z-direction. The electromagnetic modes in each layer are calculated and analytically propagated through the layers. The overall problem is solved by matching boundary conditions at each of the interfaces between the layers using a technique like scattering matrices. To solve for the electromagnetic modes, which are decided by the wave vector of the <b>incident</b> <b>plane</b> <b>wave,</b> in periodic dielectric medium, the Maxwell's equations (in partial differential form) as well as the boundary conditions are expanded by the Floquet functions and turned into infinitely large algebraic equations.

A transmission mask containing the FT of the second function, g(x,y), is placed in this same plane, one focal length behind the first lens, causing the transmission through the mask to be equal to the product, F(kx,ky) x G(kx,ky).
