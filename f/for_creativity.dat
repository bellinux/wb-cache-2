40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between creative potential and verbal and performance intelligence was examined to gain more insight in the construct of creativity. 74 participants were selected from 401 children attaining grade 4 in primary schools connected to a large foundation located {{in the middle of}} the Netherlands. Verbal and performance intelligence and verbal and figural creative potential were measured. Correlations were calculated for intelligence (TIQ, VIQ, PIQ) and creative potential (verbal, figural). No significant correlations were found. Weak, positive correlations were reported <b>for</b> verbal <b>creativity</b> and intelligence (r =. 16 to. 22), while weak, negative correlations were found <b>for</b> figural <b>creativity</b> and intelligence (r = -. 11 to -. 16). Significant stronger correlations were found <b>for</b> verbal <b>creativity</b> and TIQ than <b>for</b> figural <b>creativity</b> and TIQ (p =. 026). Following the threshold hypothesis (Guilford, 1967) means for verbal and figural <b>creativity</b> were compared <b>for</b> groups with a TIQ below and above 120. No significant differences were found. Correlations <b>for</b> intelligence and <b>creativity</b> were calculated <b>for</b> both groups. The low/average IQ group showed a moderate, positive significant correlation for TIQ and verbal creativity (r =. 35), while the high IQ group showed correlations close to zero. Correlations <b>for</b> figural <b>creativity</b> and intelligence were weak, negative and non-significant for the low/average IQ and the high-IQ group. Studying correlations for ability groups based on IQ quartiles did not lead to different conclusions. The threshold hypothesis could therefore only be confirmed <b>for</b> verbal <b>creativity...</b>|$|R

25|$|Threshold Theory (TT). A {{number of}} {{previous}} research findings {{have suggested that}} a threshold exists {{in the relationship between}} creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak. TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary <b>for</b> <b>creativity.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al. demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm etiology <b>for</b> <b>creativity</b> in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of psychosis are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/schizotypy due to dopamine overlap.|$|E

25|$|Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.

Creativity requires a confluence of all components.

25|$|J. P. Guilford drew a {{distinction}} between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym <b>for</b> <b>creativity</b> in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.|$|E

It is the technique that allows a kind of participatory interaction; the one that accommodates the audience contribution.|$|E

25|$|The early Khrushchev era offered good {{opportunities}} for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production {{was low and}} most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the Italian neorealists, French New Wave, and of directors such as Kurosawa, Buñuel, Bergman, Bresson, Andrzej Wajda (whose film Ashes and Diamonds influenced Tarkovsky) and Mizoguchi. Tarkovsky absorbed {{the idea of the}} auteur as a necessary condition <b>for</b> <b>creativity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Honing {{theory is}} held to explain certain {{phenomena}} not {{dealt with by}} other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus <b>for</b> <b>creativity.</b> Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.|$|E
25|$|Kingston {{is home to}} {{many artists}} who work in visual arts, media arts, literature, {{and a growing number}} who work in other {{time-based}} disciplines such as performance art. The contemporary arts scene in particular has two long standing professional non-profit venues in the downtown area, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (founded 1957), and Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre (founded 1977). Local artists often participate in the exhibition programming of each organization, while each also presents the work of artists from across Canada and around the world – in keeping with their educational mandates. Alternative venues for the presentation of exhibition programs in Kingston include the Union Gallery (Queen's University's student art gallery), Verb Gallery, Open Studio 22, the Kingston Arts Council gallery, The Artel: Arts Accommodations and Venue, and the Tett Centre <b>for</b> <b>Creativity</b> and Learning.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities <b>for</b> <b>creativity)</b> however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E

[...] "Although Brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with Lana, he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world.
