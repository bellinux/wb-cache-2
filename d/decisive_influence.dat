5|$|Architectural {{contributions}} from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance and Dresden Baroque). Among many renowned Baroque masters were Pöppelmann, Balthasar Neumann, Knobelsdorff and the Asam brothers. The Wessobrunner School exerted a <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> on, {{and at times}} even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The Upper Swabian Baroque Route offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, {{one of the foremost}} members of the Feuchtmayer family and the brothers Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann. Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his {{successor}} to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although {{at the time of}} Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> in Christianity in the British Isles. Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.|$|E

5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} of the Italian Renaissance differed {{from those of the}} Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists {{were among the first to}} paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.|$|E

The purpose of using a cross impact matrix within the effectsbased planning process is to find inconsistencies and <b>decisive</b> <b>influences</b> within developed plans. The cross impact matrix represents the impact between all activities, supporting effects, decisive conditions, and military end state of the plan. We develop morphological methods for analyzing activities, evaluating and refining plans, and sensitivity based methods using Dempster-Shafer theory to find the <b>decisive</b> <b>influences.</b> For the effects-based assessment process we develop a method that takes subjective assessments regarding the activities of a plan as inputs. From these assessments and the cross impact matrix we calculate assessments for all other plan elements. The method is based on belief functions and their combination under a new generalization of the discounting operation. The methods are implemented in a Collaboration Synchronization Management Tool (CSMT). ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any <b>decisive</b> <b>influence</b> on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

Using data on visitors from the USA and Japan, the major message which emerged from this study is that there are sharp differences between factors affecting US visitors and Japanese visitors. Specifically, we found: (1) the decline of Taiwan's market share in Japan has been mainly due to appreciation of NT dollars and changing preferences, whereas they are not crucial factors in the US market; (2) qualitative supply-side factors indeed could have <b>decisive</b> <b>influences</b> on the market share. However, their effect is again origin-dependent. The open-door policy of China is the only important determinant of Taiwan's competitiveness in the US market, while it has no impact on the Japanese visitors. ...|$|R

It also examines briefly the contextual work ethic within which such decisions are made and how such ethic has evolved over the times.
