However, this method is computationally demanding therefore not suitable to screen large numbers of MOFs. Another approach is to use ‘the approximate method’ which uses self-diffusivities of gases to predict <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of MOF membranes. The approximate method requires fewer amounts of time compared to the detailed method but significantly underestimates <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> since mixture correlation effects are ignored in this method. In this work, we first used computationally demanding detailed method to calculate permeabilities and selectivities of 8 different MOF membranes for Xe/Kr and Xe/Ar separations. We then compared these results with the predictions of the approximate method. After observing significant underestimation of the <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> by the approximate method, we proposed a new computational method to accurately predict gas separation properties of MOF membranes.

40|$|The {{study of}} water and gas {{transport}} through fibrous gas diffusion layer (GDL) {{is important to the}} optimization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, analytical models of dimensionless permeability, and water and <b>gas</b> relative <b>permeabilities</b> of fibrous GDL in PEMFCs are derived using fractal theory. In our models, the structure of fibrous GDL is characterized in terms of porosity, tortuosity fractal dimension (D-T), pore area fractal dimensions (d(f)), water phase (d(f,w)) and gas phase (d(f,g)) fractal dimensions. The predicted dimensionless <b>permeability,</b> water and <b>gas</b> relative <b>permeabilities</b> based on the proposed models are in good agreement with experimental data and predictions of numerical simulations reported in the literature. The model reveals that, although water phase and gas phase fractal dimensions strongly depend on porosity, the water and <b>gas</b> relative <b>permeabilities</b> are independent of porosity and are a function of water saturation only. It is also shown that the dimensionless permeability decreases significantly with the increase of tortuosity fractal dimension. On the other hand, there is only a small decrease in the water and <b>gas</b> relative <b>permeabilities</b> when tortuosity fractal dimension increases. One advantage of the proposed analytical model is that it contains no empirical constant, which is normally required in past models. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to develop a novel type of zeolite {{membrane}} and exploit some of the inherent and unique advantages of this membrane in gas separations. The development of inorganic membranes formed from a coherently grown layer of zeolite crystals is a particularly promising approach, since such membranes offer substantially higher permeabilities and selectivities compared with polymeric materials and can perform under extreme conditions, e. g. at elevated temperatures and in aggressive chemical environment. Such zeolite membranes are prepared by in-situ hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite layer within the macropores of alumina ceramic supports (tubes/discs). In this way more stable zeolite membranes are produced, avoiding outer separating layers which are prone to mechanical damage. These membranes have also been shown to have good thermal stability up to 500 °C, with no evidence of crack formation. The synthesized materials have been characterized by several techniques such as Hg and N 2 porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). From these measurements it appears that the structure of the zeolite membrane is influenced by several factors, such as structure and size of the pores of the support, chemical composition of the precursor solution from which the crystals will be harvested, reaction conditions, etc. Finally, <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> and/or selectivities have been measured for several important gas systems.
