50|$|In 2001, {{after his}} younger brother was shot during a robbery, the two {{brothers}} decided to enter the music business as a way {{getting out of the}} gang life. Around 2002, while The Game was signed to JT the Bigga Figga's Get Low Recordz, both brothers founded their own record label called The Black Wall Street Records. The name is adopted from what was the racially segregated Greenwood. During the oil boom of the 1920's, Greenwood was home to several successful and prominent African-American entrepreneurs. The label featured artists, Djs and producers such as Nu Jerzey Devil, DJ Skee, Compton Menace, A.R. (Avante Rose), Techniec and a few others. Though the company never released any official retail albums, the label had released several mixtapes. In 2005, Big Fase 100 decided to leave Black Wall Street after a dispute with his brother The Game. After his departure from Black Wall Street, Taylor started his solo career as a rapper/producer and started his own label, Brazil Street Records, and One <b>Hunned</b> Entertainment, working with independent artists in the West Coast Hip Hop scene.|$|E

After the Tiele tribes largely submitted to Tang rule during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandfather Emperor Taizong, the <b>Hun</b> tribe was incorporated as a border prefecture, the Gaolan Prefecture (臯蘭州).

His father, <b>Hun</b> Neang, was a resident monk in a local Wat in Kampong Cham province before defrocking himself to join the French resistance and married <b>Hun</b> Sen's mother, Dee Yon, in the 1940s. <b>Hun</b> Neang's paternal grandparents were wealthy landowners of Teochew Chinese heritage. <b>Hun</b> Neang inherited some of his family assets and led a relatively comfortable life, as they owned several hectares of land until a kidnapping incident forced their family to sell off much of their assets. <b>Hun</b> Sen left his family {{at the age of}} 13 to attend a monastic school in Phnom Penh.

50|$|Around 370, {{according}} to Ammianus, the peaceful {{relations between the}} Alans and <b>Huns</b> were broken, after the <b>Huns</b> attacked the Don Alans, killing many of them and establishing an alliance with the survivors.

In this study, we investigated {{the changes in}} cytokine levels in peripheral blood between the highly pathogenic PRRSV <b>HuN</b> 4 strain and its derivative strain <b>HuN</b> 4 -F 112 obtained by serial propagation in MARC 145 cells to 112 passages. The results demonstrated that pigs infected with <b>HuN</b> 4 showed a loss of appetite, decrease in body weight, raised body temperature, and respiratory symptoms, along with interstitial pneumonia lesions. The PRRSV amounts in the pigs infected with <b>HuN</b> 4 were 105 to 109 copies/ml in the blood and 1010 to 1011 copies/g in the lung tissues, whereas the virus amounts with <b>HuN</b> 4 -F 112 were 102. 15 to 103. 13 copies/ml in the blood and 103. 0 to 103. 6 copies/g in the lungs. Moreover, the levels of interleukin 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and alpha interferon (IFN-) in peripheral blood were upregulated 7 days postinoculation with <b>HuN</b> 4, which was earlier than in the <b>HuN</b> 4 -F 112 group. Furthermore, cytokine levels in the pigs infected with <b>HuN</b> 4 returned to normal on the 21 st day postinoculation, while the levels in those infected with <b>HuN</b> 4 -F 112 continued to increase. These results demonstrated that the pigs infected with the highly pathogenic PRRSV <b>HuN</b> 4 strain generated earlier {{and higher levels of}} inflammatory cytokines, and the results also indicated that <b>HuN</b> 4 may aggravate inflammation and damage tissues and organs.

30|$|There {{were two}} types of {{situations}} in which Han peoples were integrated into other groups; one situation was by force, for example those made captives of the <b>Huns,</b> Qiang, and Turks, or those forcibly resettled to the border regions by the rulers of the Central Plains, such as soldiers, poor people, and criminals; the second situation was voluntary relocation {{as a result of}} natural disasters.

25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the soul of a}} {{deceased}} person is made up of yin and yang components called <b>hun</b> and po (魂 and 魄).

At death the components split into three different souls; the po stays with the body to the grave, another goes to judgment, and the <b>hun</b> resides in an ancestral tablet. The po and <b>hun</b> are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants.
