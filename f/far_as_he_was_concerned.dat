5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position {{in order to keep}} contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble was just another in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Bourguiba and {{his friends}} of L'Action Tunisienne saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it {{developed}} an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron {{at the head of}} the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of L'Action group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the Tours Congress. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.|$|E

500|$|Due to irresolvable {{personality}} conflicts {{as well as}} musical differences, I am permanently {{leaving the}} band Audioslave. I wish the other three members nothing but the best in all of their future endeavors. He stated that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> Audioslave had disbanded, and that a greatest hits collection would be issued in the future, because of label commitments. The New York Post reported that according to sources the split was not about [...] "irresolvable personality conflicts" [...] but about the money; a friend of Cornell said, [...] "Chris was unhappy with the financial arrangement within the group—he wrote all the music, yet the other three bandmates took an equal share in the multimillion-dollar publishing rights." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} rumored to be about Jackson's {{relationship}} with Debbie Rowe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Co-writer Teddy Riley, who was quoted to have said so {{in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times in 1996, denied in a 2011 reply to a fan on Twitter that the song was about Rowe. Others have noted that when the single was originally released in 1992, Jackson dedicated the song to Diana Ross, including Jermaine Jackson, who in his book You Are Not Alone: [...] Michael: [...] Through a Brother's Eyes wrote, [...] "...that song was, as Michael told me, written with Diana Ross in mind; the one great love that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> escaped him." ...|$|E
500|$|AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid {{with the}} claim returns. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> {{claiming}} 200 {{on one day}} was nonsense. He placed particular blame on Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing which had claimed one third, around 60, of the 185 'victories' (total claims were 81 {{in the morning and}} 104 in the afternoon). More damage should have been done to German bombers inbound to the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat {{as they made their way}} to the coast. He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed. Things needed [...] "tightening up", that was Park's lesson for 15 September. Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2:1 in the British favour. It had been a decent performance, but not Fighter Command's best.|$|E

500|$|The issue {{concerned}} Hand {{again during}} the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial [...] "usurpation" [...] for the Supreme Court to {{assume the role of}} a third chamber in these cases. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{to compete at}} the Australian Championships, which doubled as the Olympic trials. His sojourn in the United Kingdom meant {{that he was a}} virtual unknown in his home country. He set a national record in winning the 100m breaststroke in a time of 1m 4.80s and also qualified for his less preferred 200m event. During the Olympic training camp in Brisbane, the Australian coaches tried to get Evans to cover more mileage at training. Evans' teammates recalled him stopping during a pool session and emphatically proclaiming that [...] "Work is a poor substitute for talent". In 2000, more than a decade after his retirement, he was still using this slogan. Evans was confident in his own training methods and refused to bend to the coaches. His teammate Mark Tonelli said that Evans [...] "knew what he was capable of and as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he was capable of anything".|$|E
500|$|To Britain's {{alarm and}} indignation, the Portuguese {{government}} announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted [...] "a letter of introduction" [...] from Reedman, conferring upon him the title [...] "Chief of the Rhodesian Mission", with powers {{to deal with}} the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal was going back on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues.|$|E

2500|$|Keane was {{included}} in the Republic of Ireland senior squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the U.S. and played in every game, including a famous 1–0 victory over tournament favourites and eventual runners-up Italy. Despite a second-round exit {{at the hands of the}} Netherlands, the tournament was considered a success for the Irish team, and Keane was named the best player of Ireland's campaign. Keane, however, was reluctant to join the post-tournament celebrations, later claiming that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> Ireland's World Cup was a disappointment: [...] "There was nothing to celebrate. We achieved little." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vandenbroucke {{had turned}} down the Giro d'Italia, {{claiming}} problems with his knee, on which he had an operation the previous winter. His psychiatrist, Jef Brouwers, said [...] "... the problems with his knee have affected him badly. He could no longer ride as he wanted after the operation. Nor could the doctors say what the problem was. These last few days, he has been terrible. The people that I called in Italy could no longer help him. He had thought it through and, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> everything was lost. The situation of his knee has worn him down completely [...] and his private life wasn't good either, with ups and downs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became so}} tense that {{war with the}} United States seemed imminent. On April 22, 1914, on the initiative of Felix A. Sommerfeld and Sherburne Hopkins, Pancho Villa traveled to Juárez to calm fears along the border and asked President Wilson's emissary George Carothers to tell [...] "Señor Wilson" [...] {{that he had no}} problems with the American occupation of Veracruz. Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> we could keep Vera Cruz [...] and hold it so tight that not even water could get in to Huerta and [...] [...] [...] he could not feel any resentment". Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers, or maybe as a result of both, Villa stepped out from under Carranza’s stated foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|No {{on-screen}} explanations {{were offered}} for the cast changes. One scene in [...] "The Metamorph" [...] mentioning Bergman's death was scripted and filmed, but {{cut from the}} final edit. The Moonbase Alpha Technical Manual produced by Starlog magazine picks up this explanation, stating Bergman died due to a faulty spacesuit per the scripted scene. Likewise, it was mentioned in this publication that Morrow and Kano had died in an Eagle crash between seasons, and explained that Dr Mathias, supposedly Alpha's psychiatrist (although {{he seems to be}} more Russell's assistant) was on sabbatical doing research. Fred Freiberger felt that these characters were one-dimensional and had no fan support; he told Nick Tate that the audience would not remember them and that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> they were just [...] "somewhere else" [...] on Alpha, lost in the crowd of three hundred other people. [...] Freiberger failed to appreciate the value of the supporting characters to the show and its fans.|$|E

2500|$|Reid apologized on January 9, 2010, for racially tinged {{comments}} he {{had made}} when Obama was campaigning for president. In private conversations, Reid had remarked that Obama could win the Presidency because the country was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama—to whom he referred as being [...] "light-skinned" [...] and [...] "with no Negro dialect, unless {{he wanted to have}} one". These comments had been recently revealed by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann in Game Change, their book about the 2008 election. In addition to his public apology, Reid called Obama to apologize; Obama accepted his apology, stating that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the book was closed on the incident. RNC Chairman Michael Steele and Senators John Cornyn and Jon Kyl called on Reid to resign his leadership position in the Senate, citing Majority Leader Trent Lott resigning because of a statement relating to race. However, multiple experts said there was virtually no chance of that. DNC Chairman Tim Kaine and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Jack Reed expressed support for Reid and confidence he would retain his leadership position, and another senior Democrat indicated Reid has [...] "produced supportive statements from key African American leaders in the Congress and civil rights community".|$|E
