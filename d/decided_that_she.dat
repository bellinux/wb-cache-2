5|$|U-30 {{began her}} first patrol {{operating}} from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940. During {{a period of}} 12 days, she traveled {{as far south as}} Portugal and sank the 712-ton British ship Ellaroy on the 21st. Three days later, on 24 July, U-30 returned to Lorient, having experienced a malfunction in one of her engines. It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would need to be used sparingly. For her next patrol it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would leave from Lorient, but would return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|After meeting an ex-boyfriend who had {{aspired to}} play {{football}} professionally and finding {{out that he had}} been signed by the Chicago Bears, Psaltis <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to pursue a career in entertainment. She resigned from the firm and moved into the entertainment industry with the goal of becoming either a model or an actress.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the UK in early 1946, Indefatigable was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians {{for the rest of}} the year before she was reduced to reserve. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The Board of Admiralty <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. Indefatigable was sold for scrap the following year.|$|E

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years. During this time, she {{wanted to become a}} theater artist, and she participated in an audition in her school during her sixth grade. She did not pass the audition as she lacked talent in performing, but her singing was praised. This event would leave an impression on her, and as her parents were not interested in her taking up performance arts, she <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to become a singer.|$|E
5|$|Mary did {{not enjoy}} her {{retirement}} for long; Eleanor died in her arms in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future. Charles {{told her that he}} wanted her to resume regency in the Netherlands, and promised a home and a large income, but Mary declined the offer. Her nephew Philip then urged her advisor to convince her to return. When Charles became ill in August, Mary accepted the offer and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would become governor once again.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki {{was born}} in Osaka, Japan on November 5, 1996, as the {{youngest}} of three children. She began aspiring to become a singer at a young age, taking dance lessons through the encouragement of her mother, and she would begin participating in singing competitions {{by the age of}} six. After being inspired in high school by the character Sheryl Nome from the anime series Macross Frontier, she <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to become an anison singer. She applied for the Animax All-Japan Anisong Grand Prix in 2010 but failed to qualify.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, he <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was a better}} actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance {{that he decided to}} cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|Jun'yō was torpedoed in November 1943 {{and spent}} three months under repair. She was damaged by several bombs during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, but quickly {{returned}} to service. Lacking aircraft, {{she was used}} as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. Jun'yō was under repair until March 1945, when work was cancelled as uneconomical. She was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans also <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not worth the cost to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship, and she was broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a painful}} pause. Mr. Mariner shot a swift {{glance at her}} in the hope of {{discovering}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had spoken humorously, but was compelled to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not.|$|R

5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not want to wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|Liukin <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{not done}} with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin {{was added to the}} national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt that she was not quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|Maxim Gorky {{tested the}} first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10 in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned {{to include a}} {{complete}} overhaul of her machinery while her radar, fire-control systems and anti-aircraft guns were {{to be replaced by}} the latest Soviet systems. Torpedo bulges were to be fitted which would increase her displacement by , with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The navy re-evaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended the refit. Maxim Gorky was sold for scrapping on 18 April 1959 after the navy had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wasn't needed as a missile-test ship.|$|E

5|$|While at high school, Levi <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would become}} a scientist. Her final year was devoted to a physics project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her {{graduation}} in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English and good manners. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where she listened to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, her father managed to get her accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on the spectra of alkali metal halides, {{under the supervision of}} Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{heard that}} at Michigan {{women were not}} even allowed to use the front entrance, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would prefer to study at Berkeley. Yuan took her to see Raymond T. Birge, {{the head of the}} physics department, and he offered Wu a place in the {{graduate}} school {{despite the fact that the}} academic year had already commenced. Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff; her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post-doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech.|$|E

25|$|Avance {{was offered}} {{to the city of}} Stockholm in 1907, but the Swedish buyers <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was too {{expensive}} and broke off the deal. Maintaining the icebreaker {{turned out to be more}} expensive than what was anticipated, and in 1909 the city of Turku purchased the majority of the shipping company's shares.|$|E
25|$|After having {{used every}} excuse to avoid pregnancy, Elisabeth later <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted a fourth child. Her {{decision}} {{was at once}} a deliberate personal choice and a political negotiation: by returning to the marriage, she ensured that Hungary, with which she felt an intense emotional alliance, would gain an equal footing with Austria.|$|E
50|$|When Michael avoids {{punishment}} for raping Bianca and she relays to Maggie <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is pregnant with Michael's child, Maggie buys {{a gun and}} secretly plans to kill him.

Fearing that her mother, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), will resent her baby due to having been raped before as well, Bianca <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is going to leave town {{to give birth to}} the child and inform everyone on her return <b>that</b> <b>she</b> adopted. Erica finds out about her pregnancy, however, and encourages her to have an abortion for her own sake. Bianca says <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will, but secretly changes her mind. During this time, Kendall finds out, and she and Bianca grow close. The two forge a deep bond.|$|R
