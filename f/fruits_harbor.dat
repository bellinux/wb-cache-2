40|$|The {{availability}} of ethylene-suppressed transgenic melon <b>fruit</b> <b>harboring</b> an ACC oxidase gene in antisense orientation (Ayub et al., 1996) allowed {{to discriminate between}} ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent ripening pathways. It has been observed that pulp coloration, accumulation of sugars, and loss of acidity are ethylene independent processes, whereas rind yellowing, flesh softening, development of the peduncular abscission (Guis et al., 1997), aroma production (Bauchot et al., 1998) and respiratory burst (not published) are ethylene dependent. The present study is aimed at characterizing the sensitivity to ethylene of softening of the flesh and yellowing of the rind by treating ethylene-suppressed melons with ethylene. The kinetics of changes have been followed under various ethylene concentrations and upon transfer to air. This has allowed an estimation of the threshold levels of ethylene required for initiating the processes and the saturating levels for full velocity. The effects of the cessation of the ethylene treatment have also been determined...|$|R

40|$|Nontyphoid {{salmonellosis}} {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica {{is the most}} common bacterial food-borne illness in humans, and fresh produce, including tomatoes, is a common vehicle. Accumulating data indicate that human enteric pathogenic bacteria, including S. enterica, interact actively with plants. Tomato plants were inoculated with S. enterica to evaluate plausible contamination routes and to determine if the tomato cultivar affects S. enterica colonization. S. enterica population levels on tomato leaves were cultivar dependent. S. enterica levels on Solanum pimpinellifolium (West Virginia 700 [WVa 700]) were lower than on S. lycopersicum cultivars. S. enterica preferentially colonized type 1 trichomes and rarely interacted with stomata, unlike what has been reported for cut lettuce leaves. Early S. enterica leaf colonization led to contamination of all fruit, with levels as high as 105 CFU per fruit. Reduced bacterial speck lesion formation correlated with reduced S. enterica populations in the phyllosphere. Tomato pedicels and calyxes also harbored large S. enterica populations following inoculation via contaminated water postharvest. WVa 700 green <b>fruit</b> <b>harbored</b> significantly smaller S. enterica populations than did red fruit or S. lycopersicum fruit. We found that plants irrigated with contaminated water had larger S. enterica populations than plants grown from seeds planted in infested soil. However, both routes of contamination resulted in detectable S. enterica populations in the phyllosphere. Phyllosphere S. enterica populations pose a risk of fruit contamination and subsequent human disease. Restricting S. enterica phyllosphere populations may result in reduced fruit contamination. We have identified WVa 700 as a tomato cultivar that can restrict S. enterica survival in the phyllosphere...|$|R

The foraging behavior of female Biosteres juglandis was studied {{in the field and}} greenhouse, with specific attention paid to their use of visual and olfactory cues produced by walnut <b>fruits</b> <b>harboring</b> R. juglandis larvae. Field work demonstrated that wasps are successful in locating fruits infested with host larvae interspersed among uninfested fruits, and that they use fruit phenological traits (i. e. stage of rot) to do so. The method by which females appear to choose fruits in the field is functional, provided there are high host infestation levels. In greenhouse assays, fruit damage (apart from larval presence) was specifically identified as an important cue affecting wasp fruit choice. Wasps are also able to orient to infested fruits using only one type of cue, either olfactory or visual. Preliminary data from a pilot analysis of volatile compounds associated with infested, uninfested, and artificially damaged walnuts indicated that visual cues were more important than olfactory cues to free-foraging wasps. Rhagoletis juglandis adult females visit walnut fruits for oviposition, while adult males visit them to obtain matings. The effect of fruit color pattern on the behavior of male and female flies both inexperienced and experienced with real ripe walnuts was studied in the greenhouse. Overall, both sexes of flies exhibited a landing preference for plastic fruit models that appear ripe and uninfested, over models that appear infested. The behavior of both sexes may be driven by females who are attempting to provide offspring with the most possible food resources. Finally, the growth and germination of Arizona walnut seeds was followed to determine whether either was affected by infestation of the husk by R. juglandis. Although infested fruits were more likely to fall off a tree sooner, this did not affect the size of a walnut or its ability to germinate...|$|R

50|$|Large {{colonies of}} Oecophylla weaver ants consume {{significant}} amounts of food, and workers continuously kill a variety of arthropods (primarily other insects) close to their nests. Insects are not only consumed by workers, but this protein source is necessary for brood development. Because weaver ant workers hunt and kill insects that are potentially harmful plant pests, trees harboring weaver ants benefit from having decreased levels of herbivory. They have traditionally been used in biological control in Chinese and Southeast Asian citrus orchards from at least 400 AD. Many studies have shown the efficacy of using weaver ants as natural biocontrol agents against agricultural pests. The use of weaver ants as biocontrol agents has especially been effective for fruit agriculture, particularly in Australia and southeast Asia. <b>Fruit</b> trees <b>harboring</b> weaver ants produce higher quality fruits, show less leaf damage by herbivores, and require fewer applications of synthetic pesticides.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{repertoire of}} long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) molecules {{has begun to}} be elucidated in mammals. Determining the biological relevance and potential gene regulatory mechanisms of these enigmatic molecules would be expedited in a more tractable model organism, such as Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, we defined a set of 1, 119 putative lincRNA genes in D. melanogaster using modENCODE whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. A large majority (1. 1 of 1. 3 Mb; 85 %) of these bases were not previously reported by modENCODE as being transcribed. Significant selective constraint on the sequences of these loci predicts that virtually all have sustained functionality across the Drosophila clade. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. We identify lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between D. melanogaster and mouse. This study predicts that the genomes of not only vertebrates, such as mammals, but also an invertebrate (<b>fruit</b> fly) <b>harbor</b> large numbers of lincRNA loci. Our findings now permit exploitation of Drosophila genetics for the investigation of lincRNA mechanisms, including lincRNAs with potential functional analogues in mammals...|$|R
30|$|Fresh <b>fruits</b> and {{vegetables}} <b>harbor</b> various microorganisms, {{some of which}} are psychrotrophic. L. monocytogenes is one of the pathogenic bacteria capable of growing at refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, it is also tolerate to acidic pH and salt concentrations up to 10 % ([Tasara and Stephan 2006]; Vescovo et al. [2006]). Therefore, it is important to seek biopreservatives that control both spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms including L. monocytogenes. Although several studies have indicated the presence of LAB species with antagonistic activity for improving the quality and safety of meat and dairy products (Gagnaire et al. [2009]; [Stiles and Holzapfel 1997]), few reports have involved fresh produce (Trias et al. [2008 a, b]). Since the isolation and screening of microorganisms from natural sources has always been the most powerful means for obtaining useful and genetically stable strains for industrially important products (Ibourahema et al. [2008]), in the prsent study, we isolated and identified bacteriocinogenic LAB from cheeses and yogurts, then further evaluated their antimicrobial effects in vitro and on fresh-cut produce inoculated with L. innocua, a surrogate bacteria for L. monocytogenes.|$|R

40|$|Fresh {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} can harbor large and diverse populations of bacteria. However, {{most of the work}} on produce-associated bacteria has focused on {{a relatively small number of}} pathogenic bacteria and, as a result, we know far less about the overall diversity and composition of those bacterial communities found on produce and how the structure of these communities varies across produce types. Moreover, we lack a comprehensive view of the potential effects of differing farming practices on the bacterial communities to which consumers are exposed. We addressed these knowledge gaps by assessing bacterial community structure on conventional and organic analogs of eleven store-bought produce types using a culture-independent approach, 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Our results demonstrated that the <b>fruits</b> and vegetables <b>harbored</b> diverse bacterial communities, and the communities on each produce type were significantly distinct from one another. However, certain produce types (i. e., sprouts, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, and strawberries) tended to share more similar communities as they all had high relative abundances of taxa belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae when compared to the other produce types (i. e., apples, peaches, grapes, and mushrooms) which were dominated by taxa belonging to the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla. Although potentially driven by factors other than farming practice, we also observed significant differences in community composition between conventional and organic analogs within produce types. These differences were often attributable to distinctions in the relative abundance...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade several gene {{mutations}} have been identifiedwhich cause inherited forms of Parkinson's disease. While Parkinsons disease is mostly a sporadic disease, understanding the function of these genes and how mutations affect their activity {{may contribute to the}} understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and hopefully may lead to the development of therapies that can slowdown the progression of the disease. In this thesis we study LRRK 2, the most common mutated gene in Parkinson's disease. Using the fruit fly as model system, we show that the loss of LRRK 2 expression leads to a decrease in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles highlighting the importance of LRRK 2 in assuring neuronal communication. The fruit fly is a very attractive model to study gene functions, especially because crosses between <b>fruit</b> flies <b>harboring</b> different genetic mutations can be quickly generated. By crossing flies with a mutated LRRK 2 gene and flies with mutations in other genes implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, we find that a decreased level of endophilin A, a key player in Clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) rescue the phenotype caused by loss of LRRK 2. This suggests that LRRK 2 and Endophilin A cooperate to regulate synaptic function. Furthermore, we show that LRRK 2 regulates Endophilin A function by phosphorylating residue Serine 75 in its (BAR) domain. Due to its unique (BAR) domain structure, endophilin can recognize, bind and tubulate membranes in vitro. In neurons, endophilin cooperates with other proteinsto maintain neurotransmission. By using different endophilin phospho-mimetic Serine 75 mutants, we show that LRRK 2 phosphorylation interferes with the ability of Endophilin A to interact with the plasma membrane which is very important to assure the renewal of synaptic vesicle during neurotransmission. Flies containing the phospho-mimetic endophilin Serine 75 transgene show indeed defects in endocytosis and neurotransmission similar to the ones containing the LRRK 2 G 2019 S mutation known to have an increased kinase activity. The reduced phosphorylated Serine 75 levels in LRRK 2 -deficient flies, but also the excessive presence of phosphorylated Serine 75 in LRRK 2 -G 2019 S lead both to a defect in endocytosis and synaptic transmission, indicating that too much or too little Serine 75 phosphorylation in endophilin A leads to a defect in endocytosis and neurotransmission. In support of this model, we show that inhibition of the kinase activity of LRRK 2 -G 2019 S LRRK 2 in flies using LRRK 2 -IN 1, a selective inhibitor of LRRK 2 rescues the synaptic deficit. This effect is dose dependent and when excess LRRK 2 -IN 1 is administered also inhibition of vesicle recycling is observed, as anticipated by the model. In conclusion, we show that a correct balance of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Endophilinat Serine 75 is crucial for proper regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons, which is regulated by the kinase activity of LRRK 2. We speculate that imbalance of this phosphorylation event may result in Parkinson's disease. It is clear that the development of LRRK 2 inhibitors as a therapy for Parkinsons disease might be complicated because too little or too much of drug might disturb this balance in a pathological way. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Fruit {{is one of}} {{important}} tissues in <b>fruited</b> plants, which <b>harbors</b> seed formation, development, and maturity. According to respiratory intensity during ripening, fruit is divided into climacteric and non-climacteric phenotypes. The climacteric fruit must release massive ethylene at ripening, also called ethylene-dependent fruit. On the contrary, the non-climacteric fruit is ethylene-independent. To date, ethylene-dependent fleshy-fruits are the primary materials for studying fruit ripening, such as tomato, apple, and banana. In ethylene-dependent fruits, ERF, as the final response gene in ethylene signaling pathway, directly regulate fruit ripening by binding to the promoters of their downstream genes, including ACO, ACS, PG, EXP, and PSY (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014). At present, LeERF 1, MaERF 9, MdERF 1, and MdERF 3 has been reported as the positive activator (Li et al. 2007, 2016; Wang et al. 2007; Xiao et al. 2013), whereas SlERF 6, MaERF 11, and MdERF 2 are the negative repressors for fruit ripening (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012). Of these ERFs, MaERF 9 and MaERF 11 could not only regulate the transcription levels of ACO 1 and ACS 1 by binding to their promoter, but also physically interacted with ACO 1 (Xiao et al. 2013). Interestingly, MaERF 11 also interact with MaHDA 1, the complex repress expression levels of downstream genes targeted by MaERF 11 via histone deacetylation (Han et al. 2016). Moreover, the regulatory route of ERF genes is intricate during fruit ripening. In apple, MdERF 2 presents at least three roads in regulating MdACS expression. MdERF 2 repressor and MdERF 3 activator could regulate the transcription level of MdACS by binding to their promoter, respectively. Meanwhile, MdERF 2 inhibit MdERF 3 activity by combining to the DRE element in the promoter, indirectly suppressed the expression level of MdACS. Thirdly, a directly interaction between MdERF 2 and MdERF 3 restrain the binding of MdERF 3 to the MdACS promoter, and then suppress the MdACS expressed in fruit flesh (Li et al. 2016). In tomato, SlERF.B 3 {{has the ability to}} activate the regulatory network for fruit ripening. A dominant repressor version of SlERF.B 3 (SlERF.B 3 -SRDX) down-regulates ethylene receptor levels, but enhances triple response and up-regulated the expression levels of EIN 3 -like gene, contributing to an acceleration of fruit ripening (Liu et al. 2013). Further study found that SlERF.B 3 -SRDX could alter the expression pattern of other ERF family members. Most notably, SlERF.B 3 -SRDX also stimulate the transcription levels of ripening regulators, including RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), NON-RIPENING (NOR), COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (CNR), and Homeodomain-leucine zipper HOMEOBOX (HB- 1) (Liu et al. 2014). Therefore, the regulatory role of AP 2 /ERF TF is multiple, and their regulated mechanism is very complex during fruit ripening.|$|R
