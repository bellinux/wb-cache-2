40|$|It {{is widely}} known that <b>industrialized</b> <b>building</b> systems can {{positively}} impact construction projects {{in terms of}} efficiency, duration, safety, and quality. Although the use of <b>industrialized</b> <b>building</b> systems can potentially simplify the production process on-site, {{the complexity of the}} overall delivery system tends to be high, especially in engineered-to-order (ETO) environments, due to factors such as uncertainty related to goals and methods, conflicts between different trades on-site, and interdependence between supply chain members. This paper explores the concept of modularity, which has proven to be useful in different industries as a way of dealing with complex systems. The aim {{of this paper is to}} illustrate how modularity can reduce the complexity of ETO <b>industrialized</b> <b>building</b> systems, in companies that adopt a mass customization strategy. This investigation is based on two descriptive case studies on the development of modular structural steel systems for buildings that have adopted innovative beam-to-column connections. The main contribution of this research is demonstrating the need to adopt an integrated product and process-oriented conceptualization of modularity in <b>industrialized</b> <b>building</b> systems. Moreover, the comparison between the two case studies pointed out that the management of tolerances plays a key role in achieving high productivity and short lead times in structural steel building systems.

The IBS approach is actively promoted through several strategies and incentives as an alternative to conventional <b>building</b> <b>methods.</b> Extensive uptakes of modern Information Communication Technology (ICT) applications are able to support the different IBS processes for effective production. However, it is argued that ICT uptake at the organizational level needs to be regularly improved. Thus, this paper fulfills the need to identify the critical barriers to ICT employment and highlighting the ICT drivers in enhancing the IBS management process. Critical barriers and drivers to ICT uptake were identified through questionnaire survey with industry stakeholders and were analyzed using mean index and critical t-value with the use of SPSS software. The critical drivers are top management support and commitment and improving the availability of the technologies. The critical drivers which were identified are significant in ensuring the enhancement of ICT implementation.
