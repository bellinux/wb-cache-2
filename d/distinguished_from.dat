5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea {{compared}} with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite.

5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.

They are also <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
