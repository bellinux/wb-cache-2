5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.

5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E

25|$|Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; – February 20, 1895) was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After {{escaping}} from slavery in Maryland, {{he became a}} national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writings. In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Northerners at the time found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such a great orator {{had once been a}} slave.|$|E
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it odd {{that a man who}} appeared to be a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E

Steven Greenlee of The Boston Globe reflected that the video was both [...] "horrifying and compelling", and stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling.

Peter Howell, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote: [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this {{is the work of}} a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of Fargo.

500|$|Lawrence Witmer {{pointed out}} that social {{behavior}} can't be determined by brain endocasts and the brains of solitary leopards are identical to those of a cooperatively hunting lion; estimated brain sizes only show that an animal may have hunted in groups. In his opinion, the brains of tyrannosaurs were large enough for what he dubs [...] "communal hunting", a semi-organized behavior that falls between solitary and cooperative hunting. Witmer claims that communal hunting is a step towards the evolution of cooperative hunting. He found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> tyrannosaurs wouldn't have exploited the opportunity to join others in making a kill, and thus decrease risk and increase their chances of success.|$|E

[...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It {{would have been a}} good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In fact, I recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E

Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic.

60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{striking}} evidence for Defoe's authorship of A Vindication is the extraordinary reference to his own natural parts and to the popularity of The True-Born Englishman some seventeen years after that topical poem had appeared [pp. 29f.].

40|$|Phonological alternations (e. g. naɪf ∼ naɪvz) are {{particularly}} costly in promi-nent positions (root, onset, stressed syllable, initial syllable). • In well-behaved languages, like Turkish, stem-final alternations are rare in monosyllables.
