5|$|Too little {{data has}} been {{gathered}} {{to assess the}} population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. It has been reported as “moderately common”, although <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings. Its distribution across the British Virgin Islands seems to be limited, and development may affect it further.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, a BART rider {{created a}} website, bartcrimes.com, to {{disseminate}} information he thought BART makes very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> on their website, intentionally making it inconvenient to access crime logs, which are public information. BART officials say crime rates remain low. But {{according to data}} requested by the San Francisco Chronicle after the mob robbery in April, figures showed a 45 percent increase in robberies aboard BART trains in its stations {{during the first quarter}} of the year.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a record company who would release the track, either because labels {{were worried about}} the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or {{because they did not}} see any {{commercial}} potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E

Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both {{claim that it}} was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined {{on the grounds of}} a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded and it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a spot to dock.|$|E
5|$|Riley renewed his {{relationship}} with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable. Bottsworth, however, became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated their relationship in January 1885. Riley's sister, Mary, had become {{a close friend of}} Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> employment once their relationship ended.|$|E

5|$|Sitting Bull and {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> enough food to feed his people, who were {{starving}} and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Flying Corps's 5th Wing {{under the}} command of Lieutenant-Colonel P B Joubert de la Ferté {{stationed}} at Mustabig supported the Anzac Mounted Division. The Wing was a composite formation of the No. 14 Squadron and the Australian Flying Corps's No. 1 Squadron. It was ordered to provide close air support, long-range scouting and long-range bombing. One British and ten Australian planes had dropped a hundred bombs on Magdhaba on 22 December and during the battle bombed and machine gunned the area, but targets were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b>|$|E
5|$|With this {{increase}} in the number of batteries of heavier guns, the armies needed to find a more efficient method of moving the heavier guns around. (It was proving <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the number of draught horses required.) The War office ordered over 1,000 Holts caterpillar tractors, which transformed the mobility of the siege artillery. The army also mounted a variety of surplus naval guns on various railway platforms to provide mobile long-range heavy artillery on the Western Front.|$|E
50|$|Rhombophryne alluaudi is a frog {{belonging}} to the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to eastern and central Madagascar. It is a terrestrial and fossorial frog that occurs in rainforest, including littoral forest. Despite being locally abundant, it is a <b>difficult</b> frog <b>to</b> <b>find.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Suspension bondage is a <b>difficult</b> subject <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{information}} on.

5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{because of their}} involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
