5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection</b> between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E
25|$|VS {{connectivity}} was via an ISA based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS Terminal Emulator, over an IPX-based <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection.</b> Originally the PC-240 {{came with}} a Wang specific Hercules Graphics Card and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, meaning the base unit could be kept {{some distance from the}} screen. This was later replaced with an EGA card and screen.|$|E

2500|$|In {{most other}} contexts, the {{industry}} uses the multipliers kilo, mega, giga, etc., {{in a manner}} consistent with their meaning in the International System of Units (SI), namely as powers of 1000. For example, a 500 gigabyte hard disk holds [...] bytes, and a 1 Gbit/s (gigabit-per-second) <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection</b> transfers data at [...] bit/s. In contrast with the binary prefix usage, this use is described as a decimal prefix, as 1000 is a power of 10 (103).|$|E

50|$|Category 5 {{cable is}} used in {{structured}} cabling for computer networks such as Ethernet over twisted pair. The cable standard provides performance of up to 100 MHz and is suitable for 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet), and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet). 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connections</b> require two wire pairs. 1000BASE-T <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connections</b> require four wire pairs. Through the use of power over Ethernet (PoE), power can be carried over the cable in addition to Ethernet data.|$|R

5000|$|Internally, Ethernet-based {{out-of-band}} management {{can either}} utilize a dedicated separate <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection,</b> {{or some kind}} of traffic multiplexing can be performed on the system's regular <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection.</b> That way, a common <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connection</b> becomes shared between the computer's operating system and the integrated baseboard management controller (BMC), usually by configuring the network interface controller (NIC) to perform Remote Management Control Protocol (RMCP) ports filtering, use a separate MAC address, or to utilize virtual LAN (VLAN) [...] Thus, out-of-band nature of the management traffic is ensured in a shared-connection scenario as the system configures the NIC to extract the management traffic from the incoming traffic flow on the hardware level, and to route it to the BMC before reaching the host and its operating system.|$|E

5000|$|... 1000BASE-CX is {{an initial}} {{standard}} for Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connections</b> with maximum distances of 25 meters using balanced {{shielded twisted pair}} and either DE-9 or 8P8C connector (with a pinout different from 1000BASE-T). The short segment length is due to very high signal transmission rate. Although it is still used for specific applications where cabling is done by IT professionals, for instance the IBM BladeCenter uses 1000BASE-CX for the <b>Ethernet</b> <b>connections</b> between the blade servers and the switch modules, 1000BASE-T has succeeded it for general copper wiring use.|$|R
