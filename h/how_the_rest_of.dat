25|$|Belfast has {{produced}} some significant artists. Sir John Lavery (1856–1941) {{was best known}} for his portraits of rich and famous of his day, while William Conor (1881–1968) and Paul Henry changed <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world viewed Ireland at the time. Belfast has numerous art galleries including Catalyst Arts and the photography gallery Belfast Exposed and is home to the photography magazine Source. The University of Ulster's Art and Design Campus in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter is planned to undergo a £30 million development programme.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{bought the}} rights to Weisberger's novel before {{it was not only}} {{published}} in 2003, but even finished. Carla Hecken, then the studio's executive vice president, had only seen the first hundred pages of manuscript and an outline for <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the plot was to go. But for her that was enough. [...] "I thought Miranda Priestly {{was one of the greatest}} villains ever," [...] she recalled in 2016. [...] "I remember we aggressively went in and scooped it up." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Hilary Rothing from UGO Networks enjoyed the perceived parallels to The Wire and praised the further development of Anna Torv's character Olivia; [...] "With tonight's premiere, the writing feels tighter, the pace is fast {{but not so much}} so that the story begins to trip over itself - and if that's any indication of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the season shapes up, then Fox will have my full attention every Thursday from 9-10pm". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, writing that he enjoyed how the writers made the show [...] "new-viewer-friendly without making existing fans too impatient". After receiving a DVD copy of the premiere in advance, IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.0/10, explaining [...] "Everything that made season one special is still here: Walter's still crazy and obsessed with food, Peter's still a smart-ass, and Olivia...well, there's a lot going on with Olivia, as usual". Isler thought newcomer Meghan Markle was [...] "cute, and spunky, but... not quite a good fit here", and praised the cliffhanger as [...] "surprising in a special way". MTV's Josh Wigler praised all the main actors' performances, and thought the episode gave the second season a [...] "strong start".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 February 1525, Imperial {{engineers}} opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello, allowing Lannoy's forces to enter the park. At the same time, Leyva sortied from Pavia with {{what remained of the}} garrison. [...] In the ensuing four-hour battle, the French heavy cavalry, which had proven so effective against the Swiss at Marignano ten years prior, masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d'Avalos's massed Spanish arquebusiers. [...] Meanwhile, a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry. [...] The French suffered massive casualties, losing the majority of their army. Bonnivet, Jacques de la Palice, La Trémoille, and Richard de la Pole were killed, while Anne de Montmorency, Robert de la Marck, and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles. [...] The night following the battle, Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris, in which he related what had befallen him: [...] "To inform you of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my ill-fortune is proceeding, all is lost to me save honour and life, which is safe." [...] Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples. [...] The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel Sforzesco in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alençon, reaching Lyon by March 1525.|$|E
2500|$|Centenarians {{are often}} the subject of news stories, which often focus {{on the fact that}} they are over 100 years old.

2500|$|In {{this part}} of the {{argument}} we refer to voter k, the pivotal voter for B over A, as pivotal voter for simplicity.

[...] Note again that the dictator for B over C is not a priori the same as that for C over B. [...] In part three of the proof we will see that these {{turn out to be the}} same too.|$|E

50|$|Limitations to {{centrality}} {{measures have}} {{led to the development of}} more general measures.

60|$|Who shall {{describe}} <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> {{that day}} was spent at Kenilworth? The Queen, {{who seemed to have}} remained there {{for the sole purpose of}} mortifying and taunting the Earl of Leicester, showed herself as skilful in that female art of vengeance, as she was in the science of wisely governing her people. The train of state soon caught the signal, and as he walked among his own splendid preparations, the Lord of Kenilworth, in his own Castle, already experienced the lot of a disgraced courtier, in the slight regard and cold manners of alienated friends, and the ill-concealed triumph of avowed and open enemies. Sussex, from his natural military frankness of disposition, Burleigh and Walsingham, from their penetrating and prospective sagacity, and some of the ladies, from the compassion of their sex, were the only persons in the crowded court who retained towards him the countenance they had borne in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|On that evening, at Wharton, Emily {{still wore}} her {{mourning}} dress. No one, indeed, dared {{to speak to}} her on the subject, and Mary was even afraid lest she might appear in black on the following day.

Everett was of course away. He was over at Longbarns with the Fletchers, and was to be brought to Wharton Church on the following morning. Old Mrs. Fletcher was at Wharton Hall,--and the bishop, whose services had been happily secured. He was formally introduced to Mrs. Lopez, the use of the name for the occasion being absolutely necessary, and with all the smiling urbanity which as a bishop he was bound to possess, he was hardly able not to be funereal as he looked at her and remembered her story. Before the evening was over Mrs. Fletcher did venture to give a hint. [...] "We are so glad you have come, my dear." ...|$|E
