50|$|<b>Etodolac</b> {{should be}} avoided by {{patients}} {{with a history of}} asthma attacks, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs. Rare but severe allergic reactions have been reported in such individuals. It also {{should be avoided}} by patients with peptic ulcer disease or poor kidney function, since this medication can worsen both conditions. <b>Etodolac</b> is used with caution in patients taking blood thinning medications (anticoagulants), such as warfarin (Coumadin), because it increases the risk of bleeding. Patients taking both lithium and <b>etodolac</b> may develop toxic blood lithium levels. Additionally, <b>etodolac</b> has been found to interact with certain anti-depressant medications, such as sertraline or fluoxetine, which can increase risks of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular conditions. Patients also taking ciclosporin (Sandimmune) can develop kidney toxicity. Use in children has not been adequately studied. <b>Etodolac</b> is not habit-forming. NSAIDs should be discontinued prior to elective surgery because of a mild interference with clotting that is characteristic of this group of medicines. <b>Etodolac</b> is best discontinued at least four days in advance of surgery.|$|E

50|$|NSAIDs {{are used}} for the {{management}} of mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation. They work by reducing the levels of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that are responsible for pain and the fever and tenderness that occur with inflammation. <b>Etodolac</b> blocks the cyclooxygenase (abbrev.

40|$|AbstractPoor transdermal {{penetration}} of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) impairs both bioavailability and therapeutic benefits {{and is a}} major challenge {{in the development of}} transdermal drug delivery systems. Here, we transformed a poorly water-soluble drug, <b>etodolac,</b> into an ionic liquid in order to improve its hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and skin permeability. The ionic liquid was prepared by mixing <b>etodolac</b> with lidocaine (1 : 1, mol/mol). Both the free drug and the transformed ionic liquid were characterized by differential scanning colorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and saturation concentration measurements. In addition, in vitro skin-permeation testing was carried out via an ionic liquid-containing patch (Etoreat patch). The lidocaine and <b>etodolac</b> in ionic liquid form led to a relatively lower melting point than either lidocaine or <b>etodolac</b> alone, and this improved the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of <b>etodolac.</b> In vitro skin-permeation testing demonstrated that the Etoreat patch significantly increased the skin permeation of <b>etodolac</b> (9. 3 -fold) compared with an <b>etodolac</b> alone patch, although an Etoreat patch did not increase the skin permeation of lidocaine, which was consistent with the results when using a lidocaine alone patch. Lidocaine appeared to self-sacrificially improve the skin permeation of <b>etodolac</b> via its transformation into an ionic liquid.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{inhibitor}} <b>etodolac</b> on the mechanical allodynia induced by paclitaxel was investi-gated in mice and compared {{with the effects of}} the nonselec-tive COX inhibitors indomethacin and diclofenac, the selective COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib, the calcium channel 2 subunit inhibitor pregabalin, the sodium channel blocker mexiletine, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine. The decrease in the paw-withdrawal threshold induced by pac-litaxel was reversed by oral administration of <b>etodolac</b> at 10 mg/kg but was not affected by indomethacin, diclofenac, or celecoxib. The antiallodynic effect of <b>etodolac</b> gradually in-creased during repeated administration, and after 2 weeks the paw-withdrawal threshold at the preadministration point was significantly increased. Pregabalin, duloxetine, and mexiletine also showed an antiallodynic effect in this model. Whereas pregabalin had a preadministration effect similar to that of <b>etodolac</b> during repeated administration, mexiletine or dulox-etine had no such effect. There was almost no difference in the distribution of <b>etodolac</b> and diclofenac in nervous tissue, indi-cating that COX inhibition is unlikely {{to be involved in the}} antiallodynic effect of <b>etodolac.</b> <b>Etodolac</b> did not show a neu-roprotective effect against morphological transformations such as the axonal degeneration induced by paclitaxel. Instead, et-odolac probably acts at the level of functional changes accom-panying paclitaxel treatment, such as alterations in the activa-tion state of components of the pain transmission pathway. Our findings suggest that <b>etodolac</b> attenuates paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy by a COX-independent pathway and that it might be useful for the treatment of paclitaxel-induced pe-ripheral neuropathy...|$|E

Design Sixteen patients (8 F, 8 M; mean age: 61 ± 11. 2 years) with painful hOA were included in a randomized, crossover, double-blind study versus placebo. Space and time parameters were assessed using Bessou's locometer and pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) at t 0 (before taking the drug), t 60 (min), t 120, and t 180 after taking a 300 -mg tablet of <b>etodolac.</b> Results Walking speed was significantly faster only between t 0 and t 180 under <b>etodolac</b> versus placebo (P< 0. 02). Walking speed increased between t 0, t 60, t 120 and t 180 with <b>etodolac</b> (P< 0. 003), but not with placebo. Stride length increased (P< 0. 0001) only on the hOA side, while the time parameters of gait for etodolac- and placebo-treated patients did not differ. VAS values differed significantly at t 0 (P< 0. 01) between <b>etodolac</b> and placebo groups, but no significant difference was observed at t 60, t 120 and t 180. Conclusions Bessou's locometer was able to demonstrate {{the efficacy of}} 300 mg of <b>etodolac</b> on gait in hOA. Walking speed was faster 3 h after taking the drug, essentially due to a greater stride length. Pain reduction in the <b>etodolac</b> group contributed to gait improvement.

Optimized formulation of SEDDS was selected for bioavailability assessment in rabbits. Also, the anti-inflammatory effect of SEDDS formulation was determined in rats, compared with powder drug and <b>etodolac</b> suspension in water (50 mg kg(- 1)).

40|$|Background: <b>Etodolac</b> is a {{selective}} cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitor, {{with evidence of}} efficacy in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Its analgesic efficacy in postoperative pain has not been clearly established. There are no systematic reviews on Etodolac's use in this condition. Objectives: To assess the analgesic efficacy of <b>etodolac</b> in single oral doses for moderate and severe postoperative pain. Search strategy: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to May 2009. Selection criteria: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered <b>etodolac</b> (any formulation) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected. Main results: Nine studies (1459 participants) compared <b>etodolac</b> and placebo. Studies were of adequate reporting quality, {{and the majority of}} participants had pain following dental extractions. The dose of <b>etodolac</b> used was 25 mg to 1200 mg, with most of the information for 100 mg and 200 mg. For at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours compared with placebo the NNT for <b>etodolac</b> 100 mg (498 participants) was 4. 8 (3. 5 to 7. 8) and for <b>etodolac</b> 200 mg (670 participants) it was 3. 3 (2. 7 to 4. 2). Very limited information with the extended release formulation did not suggest improved benefit for this outcome. The proportion of participants with at least 50 % pain relief was 41 % with 100 mg and 44 % with 200 mg. Remedication was needed by about 60 % with <b>etodolac</b> 200 mg or 400 mg over 6 to 8 hours, compared with almost 80 % with placebo. Adverse events were uncommon, and not significantly different form placebo. Authors' conclusions: <b>Etodolac</b> 200 mg may be a useful analgesic in postoperative pain, with efficacy similar to paracetamol 1000 mg and celecoxib 200 mg. Higher doses may provide analgesia equivalent to more commonly used drugs, such as ibuprofen 400 mg, naproxen 500 mg and diclofenac 50 mg. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Both the treatment groups showed a statistically significant improvement in all the efficacy parameters at the end of 8 weeks as compared to baseline (P< 0. 05) with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Adverse events were few and mild in nature. Conclusion. Combination of <b>etodolac</b> and eperisone is as effective as <b>etodolac</b> alone in patients of OA knee. Thus, it is concluded that additional use of muscle relaxant has no adjuvant value in patients of OA knee and is not recommended.

40|$|Small scale {{experimental}} {{model for}} the preparation of methyl ester of <b>etodolac,</b> the key intermediate in the synthesis of nonsteroidal drug <b>etodolac,</b> is thoroughly investigated in order to define the key parameters needed for its large scale production. Oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction of 7 -ethyltryptophol and methyl 3 -oxopentanoate with inorganic acids as catalysts was monitored over time using HPLC method with UV detection. HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of 7 -ethyltryptophol and the product was developed first. The conversion of 7 -ethyltryptophol to <b>etodolac</b> precursor was performed using different molar equivalents of acid (1 - 5 {{with respect to the}} β-ketoester) and starting 7 -ethyltryptophol of different degrees of purity. Kinetic profiles and optimal reaction times were in each case defined and key parameters selected...|$|E
40|$|The non-steroidal anti {{inflammatory}} drugs represent one of {{the most}} commonly detectedcompounds in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and surface water with scarce informationconcerning possible ecotoxicological risks. As in mammals, COX has been shown to play a role inreproduction in fish. Since studies on human breast cancer cells showed that COXs-inhibitors decreasedaromatase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression at the transcriptional level we tested theeffects of supplementation of COX 2 -inhibitors (<b>etodolac</b> and etoricoxib) in the diet of fry tilapia on growthrate and mortality during the crucial period of sexual differentiation. Highlight on etoricoxibpharmacokinetics was carried out by determination of etoricoxib in fish feces using reversed-phase HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (RF-HPLC) with Evaporative Light Scattering and Photo Diode arraydetector (ELSD-PDA system). At an age of 8 days post-hatched, 30 genetically mixed population ofOreochromis niloticus larvae were stocked in duplicate, into 45 L aquariums in a closed system for sixmonths. Treatments included 5 different experimental diets including, respectively, 0. 5 % <b>etodolac,</b> 1 %etodolac, 2 % <b>etodolac,</b> 0. 5 % etoricoxib, and 1 % etoricoxib concentrations and one standard diet servingas control with two repeats for each group from 0. 5 % groups of diets. Fish were fed experimental dietsfor 8 weeks and were changed to control diet after. Another experiment was conducted using 10 adultsmixed population stocked in triplicate in a closed system and treated as above. Growth rates (GR) weresignificantly affected with the highest growth rate obtained with the 0. 5 % <b>etodolac.</b> However, noincrease or decrease in growth was observed in mixed adults population. GR increased with increasingconcentrations with the highest GR in the aquarium treated with 2 % <b>etodolac,</b> followed by 1 % etodolac,but 1 % etoricoxib showed a decreased GR compared to standard which could indicates a toxic potentialtoward fish at this concentration. No etoricoxib peak was detected on HPLC in feces samples whichreflected, that, it was well absorbed by tilapias, extensively metabolized with no unchanged fractionexcreted, or may undergo enter hepatic circulation, increasing further its toxic potential. No mortalitywas observed in adults mixed population. Mortality rates were 3. 7 % with 0. 5 % <b>etodolac,</b> 10 % with 0. 5 %etoricoxib, 30 % with 1 % <b>etodolac,</b> 37 %with 1 %etoricoxib, and 50 % with 2 % <b>etodolac</b> treatments,respectively.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} antibiotics and a cyclooxygenase(COX) - 2 in- hibitor on lung carcinogenesis in rats initiated with N-nitrosobis(2 -hydroxypropyl) amine (BHP) were investigated. Male Wistar rats were given tap water without BHP or tap water containing 2000 ppm BHP with a basal diet for 12 weeks {{followed by the}} basal diet or the diet containing test compounds for 8 weeks. Rats received basal diet or diets containing 0. 02 % clarithromycin (CAM), 0. 015 % <b>etodolac,</b> 0. 02 % CAM plus 0. 015 % <b>etodolac,</b> respectively. The incidences of lung lesions were not different but the numbers of lesions including adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenos- quamous carcinoma (ASCC) decreased in rats given CAM, <b>etodolac</b> or CAM plus <b>etodolac</b> as compared with those in rats given no drugs. In the lungs of rats which received the drugs, the suppression of chronic inflammation in the alveolar spaces and walls was evident. The labeling index of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased in alveplar hyper- plasia (AH) in the lungs of rats which received CAM, <b>etodolac</b> and CAM plus etodolac; however, 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) generation studied by immunohistochemis- try did not differ between the lungs of rats {{with or without the}} administration of drugs. The results indicate that the suppression of chronic inflammation may inhibit the progression of lung carcinogenesis by BHP in rats and possibly provide a chemotherapeutic strategy for controlling advanced lung cancer...|$|E
