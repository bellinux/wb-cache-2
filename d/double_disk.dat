500|$|Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 was {{released}} on September 25, 2012. The songs [...] "Go to Sleep" [...] and [...] "Bitch Bad" [...] were also released as singles. The album received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 18 reviews. It was also nominated for Best Rap Album at the 55th Grammy Awards. Originally, the album was set to be released as a double-disc album, but Atlantic Records did not allow this arrangement, so the album was divided into two. It was confirmed that a Part 2 will be released in Spring 2013. Lupe has said the album showcases more of his dexterity and lyrical substance. S1 has confirmed to be producing on the album.

2500|$|Kravitz {{released}} his début album Let Love Rule on September 6, 1989, {{a combination of}} rock and funk with a 1960s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States, but became an instant hit outside of the US, especially in Europe. Lisa Bonet directed the debut music video for the title track, [...] "Let Love Rule". Stephen Smith signed Kravitz with talent booking agency CAA, who soon were fielding offers for Kravitz, first on a club tour, and then in opening slots for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. Having played essentially all of the instruments on the album, Kravitz had to quickly assemble a touring band to support the Let Love Rule release. They included a childhood friend, Zoro on drums (formerly of Bobby Brown's band), Adam Widoff (guitar), Lebron Scott (bass guitar, recruited from Curtis Mayfield's band after seeing them perform in a NYC club), Kenneth Crouch (keyboards) and Karl Denson on saxophone. In May 2009, a 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of [...] "Let Love Rule" [...] was released worldwide by Virgin. The <b>double</b> <b>disk</b> includes a booklet with rare photos, and 18 additional demos, bonus tracks and live recordings. Kravitz launched a LLR(20) tour of Europe and the United States {{in support of the}} re-release.|$|E
40|$|A tillage {{reference}} implement (TRI) {{concept to}} predict and compare draft requirements for tillage implements was developed. The reference implement concept {{was based on}} implement draft and soil and implement scale factors. The scale factors consist of a soil scale factor, implement scale factor and soil and implement scale factor. The TRI draft {{with the use of}} scale factors can predict the implement draft irrespective of soil types and field conditions. The TRI concept was tested using a tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator. The predicted implement draft values were in close agreement with the measured values. The TRI was used to determine the force differences in a tillage operation and to predict the tillage induced changes in soil properties. The TRI draft, after the implement operation, was found to be lower than that beside the operation. The relationship of implement draft to soil and implement geometric parameters need to be precisely developed to predict the tillage effect of soil properties. ^ The TRI, tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator drafts, vertical forces and torques were significantly affected by the tillage depths and travel speeds. The draft, vertical force and torque models for the implements and TRI were related as a quadratic of tillage depth. ^ A microprocessor based non-contact ultrasonic sensor was used to measure tillage depths. The sensor was tested on concrete, grass, wheat stubble, lightly disked wheat stubble and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces. It performed well on concrete and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces and the measured values gave coefficient of variation lower than 10 % on concrete and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces. The precise measurements of tillage depths in the <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces were used in developing the draft model. ^ To adjust the soil scale factors for variations in soil parameters within a given soil type, a soil cone index was used as a covariate in the draft models. The effects of soil moisture content and bulk density on the cone index values were normalized using covariate analysis technique. The technique allowed treatments comparison at same and across depths. Cone index models for wheat stubble and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces were developed based on soil depth, moisture content and bulk density. The model gave a fair estimate and the predicted values of the cone index were found within 8 % of the measured values. ...|$|R

Many parameters were measured to study {{their influence on}} the performance of single and <b>double</b> shaft <b>disk</b> filters at various rotation speeds. These parameters are pressure inside the housing, permeate flux, and electrical power consumption. The average velocity coefficient ˜k for single and <b>double</b> shaft <b>disk</b> separators was estimated and was found to be a good criterion of module performance as well. The comparison of measured and calculated filtration flow rate at various rotation speeds was in a good agreement.
