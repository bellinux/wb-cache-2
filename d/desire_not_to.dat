5|$|Rivett's body, {{which had}} been held for several weeks {{following}} the murder, was released to her family and cremated at Croydon crematorium on 18December 1974. A police spokesman cited Lady Lucan's <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> upset the family {{as a reason for}} her non-attendance at the cremation.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the opening}} of the IGC, the Polish {{government}} expressed a desire to renegotiate the June agreement, notably over the voting system, but relented under political pressure by most other Member States, due to a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be seen as the sole trouble maker over the negotiations.|$|E

25|$|The {{month of}} July was an {{otherwise}} quiet month for D.C. United, as the club only played two regular season fixtures, and a mid-season friendly match. The lack of matches during the span was primarily due the FIFA International Match Calendar and MLS's <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have conflicting dates with the match calendar.|$|E

Warner was considered to be a potential vice presidential candidate, until he took himself out of consideration after receiving the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 the new Egyptian President Anwar Sadat {{expelled}} the Soviet advisers from Egypt. This {{and frequent}} invasion exercises by Egypt and Syria led to Israeli complacency {{about the threat}} from these countries. In addition the <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be held responsible for}} initiating conflict and an election campaign highlighting security, led to an Israeli failure to mobilize, despite receiving warnings of an impending attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} {{lose sight of}} the fact that the outward event has not always been a {{fulfillment}} of the firmest faith," [...] said Deronda, in a tone that was made hesitating by the painfully conflicting <b>desires,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give any severe blow <b>to</b> Mordecai, and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give his confidence a sanction which might have the severest of blows in reserve.|$|R
60|$|The story relates {{that somewhere}} on the coast Captain Kidd had {{captured}} a young lady named Hannah, and <b>not</b> knowing what <b>to</b> do with her, and <b>desiring</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> commit an unnecessary extravagance by disposing of a useful sailor, he determined to kill Hannah, and bury her with the treasure, in order that she might keep away intruders until he came for it.|$|R

[...] "Let me, pray, call some one else." ...|$|R
25|$|Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet {{wrote the}} {{character}} Amélie for Watson to play (Amélie was originally named Emily) but she eventually turned the role down due to difficulties speaking French and a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be away from}} home. The role went on to make an international star of Audrey Tautou. She {{was also the first}} choice to play Elizabeth I in Shekhar Kapur's film Elizabeth, the role that won Cate Blanchett an Academy Award nomination.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the refugee crisis could not {{continue}} indefinitely was emphasized in January 1996 when Burundi closed the two camps within its borders and told the refugees that they should return to Rwanda. The refugees instead began to trickle across into Tanzania until Tanzania closed its Burundian border in April after its refugee burden reached 550,000. Burundi, then {{in the midst of}} a civil war, had been stressed by the demands of the refugees but was also influenced by a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> antagonize the new government of its neighbor to the north.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} accusations {{about how well}} autistic people of {{different}} functioning levels are represented in the movement. Critics of the movement argue that anyone on the autism spectrum {{who is able to}} express their <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be cured must be high functioning autistic or have Asperger syndrome, Lenny Schafer argues that if every use of autism were changed to read Asperger syndrome, then the movement might make sense, although the incorporation of Asperger syndrome into the autism diagnosis in the DSM-5 {{has been used as a}} counterargument by the autism rights movement.|$|E
50|$|The default {{start and}} {{increment}} values might reveal {{information about a}} table that it is <b>desired</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reveal to people viewing individual table rows. For example, using an AutoNumber field for a customer ID might reveal information that it is desirable <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reveal to, say, customer number 6. This {{is one example of}} occasion where the start value of an AutoNumber field is raised, so that customer number 6 has, say, AutoNumber field value 10006.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} verses of chapter 3, the Kaushitaki Upanishad asserts that {{to really know}} someone, one must know his soul.

25|$|All {{of these}} sources tell of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> dwell on the loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, Jones tried to {{convince}} Miles Davis to revive the music he had recorded on several classic albums of the 1960s, which had been arranged by Gil Evans. Davis had always refused, citing a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> revisit the past. But in 1991, Davis, then suffering from pneumonia whose complications would eventually kill him, relented and agreed to perform the music at a concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The resulting album from the recording, Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, was Davis's last released album; he died several months afterwards. It is considered an artistic triumph.|$|E
25|$|Different {{historians have}} cited {{other reasons for}} the INA's {{recruits}} volunteering to serve with the Japanese enemy. These included both the ideal of wanting to fight for India's independence, the inevitable <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be interned in the POW camp, as well as ambition. Some cite the destruction and devaluation of the Raj's prestige and authority in the Malayan debacle and the humiliating surrender at Singapore that first shook the Sepoys' loyalty to the Raj. In addition, a number of authors have cited the disparity in the service conditions (including scopes of progression in the army) and treatment of white and Indian troops within the army as another reason for ill-feelings within the Indian troops.|$|E

25|$|African-American athletes protested against LDS Church {{policies}} by boycotting several {{sporting events}} with Brigham Young University. In 1968, {{after the assassination}} of Martin Luther King, black members of the UTEP track team approached their coach and expressed their <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> compete against BYU in an upcoming meet. When the coach disregarded the athletes' complaint, the athletes boycotted the meet. In 1969, 14 members of the University of Wyoming football team {{were removed from the}} team for planning to protest the policies of the LDS church. In November 1969, Stanford University President Kenneth Pitzer suspended athletic relations with BYU. Athletes protested Mormon racial policies at Arizona State University, San Jose State University, the University of New Mexico, and others.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese leaders, such as Captain Inuzuka Koreshige (犬塚 惟重), Colonel Yasue Norihiro (安江 仙弘), and {{industrialist}} Aikawa Yoshisuke (鮎川 義介), came {{to believe}} that Jewish economic and political power could be harnessed by Japan through controlled immigration, and that such a policy would also ensure favor from the United States through the influence of American Jewry. Although efforts were made to attract Jewish investment and immigrants, the plan was limited by the government's <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> interfere with its alliance with Nazi Germany. Ultimately, it was left up to the world Jewish community to fund the settlements and to supply settlers and the plan failed to attract a significant long-term population or create the strategic benefits for Japan that had been expected by its originators.|$|E
25|$|According to Marvin Harris, another {{anthropologist}} {{and among}} the first proponents of cultural materialism, these killings of legitimate children occurred only among the Rajputs and other elite land-owning and warrior groups. The rationale was mainly economic, lying in a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> split land and wealth among too many heirs and in avoiding the payment of dowries. Sisters and daughters would marry men of similar standing and thus pose {{a challenge to the}} cohesion of wealth and power, whereas concubines and their children would not and thus could be allowed to live. He further argues that the need for warriors in the villages of a pre-industrial society meant female children were devalued, and the combination of war casualties and infanticide acted as a necessary form of population control.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2008 South Ossetia war, Russia {{recognized}} South Ossetia as independent. This unilateral {{recognition by}} Russia {{was met by}} condemnation from Western Blocs, such as NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the European Council due to the violation of Georgia's territorial integrity. The EU's diplomatic response to the news was delayed by disagreements between Eastern European states, the UK wanting a harsher response and Germany, France and other states' <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> isolate Russia. Former US envoy Richard Holbrooke said the conflict could encourage separatist movements in other former Soviet states along Russia's western border. Several days later, Nicaragua became the second country to recognize South Ossetia. Venezuela recognized South Ossetia on September 10, 2009, becoming the third UN member state to do so.|$|E
25|$|During the Panmunjeom Truce negotiations, {{the chief}} {{stumbling}} block to {{the arrangement of}} a final armistice {{during the winter of}} 1951–1952 revolved around the exchange of prisoners. At first glance, there appeared to be nothing to argue about, since the Geneva Conventions of 1949, by which both sides had pledged to abide, called for the immediate and complete exchange of all prisoners upon the conclusion of hostilities. This seemingly straightforward principle, however, disturbed many Americans. To begin with, UN prisoner-of-war camps held over 40,000 South Koreans, many of whom had been impressed into Communist service and who had no desire to be sent north upon the conclusion of the war. Moreover, a considerable number of North Korean and Chinese prisoners had also expressed a <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return to their homelands. This was particularly true of the Chinese POWs, some of whom were anti-Communists whom the Communists had forcibly inducted during the Chinese Civil War into the PLA unit that was later transferred into Korea.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{perceived}} {{success of the}} 13 August mobilisation in Lewisham, the SWP launched the Anti Nazi League in the Autumn of 1977 {{with a series of}} celebrity-endorsed adverts published in the press. Although it was portrayed as a broad initiative supported by the SWP along with wide swathes of the Labour Left and figures from popular culture (singers, musicians, actors etc.), the ANL was seen by many on the left as a self-serving unilateral SWP initiative to seize the leadership of the anti-racist movement and was regarded with suspicion by many anti-racist/anti-fascist activists. This was particularly true of many in the existing broad-based Anti-Fascist Committees (often with close connections to the local labour and trade union movement). The fact that local ANL groups were often launched as an SWP-led alternative to existing broad-based Anti-Fascist Committees increased the suspicions of non-SWP activists but a widespread <b>desire</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> display public divisions (and a fear of alienating the ANL's celebrity sponsors) meant that these divisions were kept fairly quiet. The ANL also received support from other Trotskyist groups and the Communist Party of Great Britain (who restrained their members and supporters from openly criticising the ANL).|$|E

One layer of asphalt shingles, roof felt, and a plywood roof deck is considered to attenuate the signal to about half.|$|R
