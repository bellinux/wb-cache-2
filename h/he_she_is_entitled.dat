Life, he conceived, was to Bailey a stately march. Sybil Wilbur evidently looked on it as a mad gallop.|$|R

40|$|Social {{assistance}} to the poor is increasingly subject to compulsory work requirements in Germany. Municipalities have started to offer temporary employment in their job-creation companies to claimants {{who are able to}} work.

Further savings to local funds arise from the fact that when a worker’s temporary employment ends, <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>entitled</b> to federal unemployment benefits which involve no costs for the municipality. The paper analyses this vertical fiscal externality and shows that in the long run, municipalities tend to employ a suboptimal number of welfare recipients in their companies.
