[...] Also {{reviewing}} the twelfth season, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson was less positive, commenting: [...] "I’d love to report that 'Menace' disrupts the string of mediocre episodes , but I can’t. Like its predecessors, it offers a moderately enjoyable experience, but that’s the best it can <b>do.</b> <b>Expect</b> a few chuckles and little else." ...|$|E

She collaborated with director Gina Vecchione and producer Michelle Price {{to create a}} short silent film called YARNANA, through Kickstarter-based fundraising. [...] "Inspired by the silent film genre, it relies solely on powerful music, sound design and physical expression. The characters speak through modern dance, physical comedy, capoeira, martial arts, poi, belly dancing, breakdance, acrobatics, gymnastics and the instincts of soul searchers." [...] The project's funding was ultimately canceled on Kickstarter, but the film was still created, and it won a film festival award. Her first {{solo exhibition}} in the United Kingdom, called [...] "I {{do not expect to}} be a mother but I <b>do</b> <b>expect</b> to die alone", was influenced by her experiences while she lived there.|$|E

I {{do not expect}} the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I <b>do</b> <b>expect</b> it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." [...] The speech created an evocative image {{of the danger of}} disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated [...] " [...] is the strong man of the party...and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won." ...|$|E

500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really <b>do</b> <b>expect</b> me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|An Essay {{begins with}} a series of letters in which Makin {{establishes}} her audience with her original appeal to “all Ingenious and Virtuous Ladies, more especially to her Highness the Lady Mary, eldest Daughter to his Royal Highness the Duke of York" [...] (Makin 1673). In the introductory epistle, Makin admits that to challenge customs, to imply that women are reasonable creatures who will benefit from learning, is a bold attempt and she expects to meet opposition {{while at the same time}} claiming that the patronage of the Royal Highness will be a form of protection. Here, in Makin's exordium, through the use of kairos, she appeals to her audience's interest and sympathy. While her audience is both male and female, her emotional appeal, the pathos of her treatise, is directed at women, for she writes: “I expect to meet with many scoffs and taunts from inconsiderate and illiterate men, that prize their own lusts and pleasure more than your profit and content” (Makin 1673). She goes on to state: “I shall be the less concerned at these, so long as I am in your favor; and this discourse may be a weapon in your hands to defend yourselves, whilst you endeavor to polish your souls, that you may glorify God" [...] (Makin 1673). She further emphasises [...] "ladies" [...] as her target audience: “I hope I shall not need to beg the patience of ladies to peruse this pamphlet: I have bespoken and <b>do</b> <b>expect</b> your patronage, because it is your cause I plead against an ill custom, prejudicial to you, which men will not willingly suffer to be broken” (Makin 1673).|$|E
