25|$|SARA {{is present}} in an <b>early</b> <b>endosome</b> which, by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, internalizes the {{receptor}} complex. SARA recruits an R-SMAD. SARA permits the binding of the R-SMAD to the L45 region of the Type I receptor. SARA orients the R-SMAD such that serine residue on its C-terminus faces the catalytic region of the Type I receptor. The Type I receptor phosphorylates the serine residue of the R-SMAD. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the MH2 domain of the R-SMAD and its subsequent dissociation from the receptor complex and SARA.|$|E
2500|$|In most eukaryotes, the Golgi {{apparatus}} {{is made up}} of {{a series}} of compartments consisting of two main networks: the cis Golgi network (CGN) and the trans Golgi network (TGN). The CGN is a collection of fused, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as cisternae (singular: cisterna, also called [...] "dictyosomes"), originating from vesicular clusters that bud off the endoplasmic reticulum. A mammalian cell typically contains 40 to 100 stacks. Between four and eight cisternae are usually present in a stack; however, in some protists as many as sixty cisternae have been observed. This collection of cisternae is broken down into cis, medial, and trans compartments. The TGN is the final cisternal structure, from which proteins are packaged into vesicles destined to lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the cell surface. The TGN is usually positioned adjacent to the stacks of the Golgi apparatus, but can also be separate from the stacks. The TGN may act as an <b>early</b> <b>endosome</b> in yeast and plants.|$|E

In spite of its significance, the molecular mechanism underlying this machinery remains largely unknown. Actin filaments are implicated in intracellular trafficking, including membrane fission at endocytosis, membrane stretching at the Golgi complex, and maturation of endosomes. We have recently found that actin is required for receptor sorting in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and identified cortactin as a candidate for actin regulation in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> Inhibition of actin dynamics leads to enlargement of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and impairment of the sorting; the latter is also observed in cortactin-depleted cells. The endosomal localization of cortactin was enhanced by dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that effectively inhibits endosomal sorting, indicating that cortactin is involved in the sorting machinery in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> Here we discuss the role of actin filaments in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and other molecules implicated in endosomal trafficking...|$|R

The viruses progressed from Rab 5 -positive <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> to {{a population of}} <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> (about 10 % of total) that contained both Rab 5 and Rab 7.

The process was independent of Arf 1 and the acidic pH in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> Nocodazole treatment showed that the release of transport carriers was assisted by microtubules. Expression of constitutively inactive Rab 7 T 22 N resulted in accumulation of SFV in <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> We concluded that Rab 7 is recruited to <b>early</b> <b>endosomes,</b> where it forms distinct domains that mediate cargo sorting {{as well as the}} formation of late-endosome-targeted transport vesicles...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDifferent {{classes of}} endosomes exhibit a {{characteristic}} intracellular steady-state distribution governed by {{interactions with the}} cytoskeleton. We found a kinesin- 3, KIF 16 B, that transports <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> to the plus end of microtubules in a process regulated by the small GTPase Rab 5 and its effector, the phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinase hVPS 34. In vivo, KIF 16 B overexpression relocated <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> to the cell periphery and inhibited transport to the degradative pathway. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative mutants or ablation of KIF 16 B by RNAi caused the clustering of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> to the perinuclear region, delayed receptor recycling to the plasma membrane, and accelerated degradation. These results suggest that KIF 16 B, by regulating the plus end motility of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes,</b> modulates the intracellular localization of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and the balance between receptor recycling and degradation.

40|$|The {{retrograde}} transport route links <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and the TGN. Several endogenous and exogenous cargo proteins use this pathway, {{one of which}} is the well-explored bacterial Shiga toxin. ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are ~ 20 kDa GTP-binding proteins that are required for protein traffic {{at the level of the}} Golgi complex and <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> In this study, we expressed mutants and protein fragments that bind to Arf-GTP to show that Arf 1, but not Arf 6 is required for transport of Shiga toxin from <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> to the TGN. We depleted six Arf 1 -specific ARF-GTPase-activating proteins and identified AGAP 2 as a crucial regulator of {{retrograde transport}} for Shiga toxin, cholera toxin and the endogenous proteins TGN 46 and mannose 6 -phosphate receptor. In AGAP 2 -depleted cells, Shiga toxin accumulates in transferrin-receptor-positive <b>early</b> <b>endosomes,</b> suggesting that AGAP 2 functions in the very early steps of retrograde sorting.

An antibody to human rab 4 p was found to detect a doublet of approximately 24 -kDa proteins on immunoblots from various cell types. Seventy-five percent of these proteins were tightly membrane bound and could be released only by detergent treatment. Upon isolation of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes,</b> late endosomes, and lysosomes, by free-flow electrophoresis and Percoll density-gradient centrifugation, most (70 %) of the rab 4 p was found to cofractionate with <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and endocytic vesicles containing 125 I-labeled transferrin. The rab proteins previously localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus were not found in these fractions. We also localized rab 4 p to transferrin-receptor-containing <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> by immunofluorescence after expression of rab 4 cDNA.

50|$|Pinocytosis, {{also known}} as cell drinking, is the {{absorption}} of small aqueous particles along with the membrane receptors that recognize them. It {{is an example of}} fluid phase endocytosis and is usually a continuous process within the cell. The particles are absorbed through the use of clathrin coated pits. These clathrin coated pits are short lived and serve only to form a vesicle for transfer of particles to the lysosome. The clathrin coated pit invaginates into the cytosol and forms a clathrin coated vesicle. The clathrin proteins will then dissociate. What is left is known as an <b>early</b> <b>endosome.</b> The <b>early</b> <b>endosome</b> merges with a late endosome. This is the vesicle that allows the particles that were endocytosed to be transported into the lysosome. Here there are hydrolytic enzymes that will degrade the contents of the late endosome.

Other receptors can nucleate a clathrin-coated pit allowing formation around the receptor. A mature pit will pinch off from the plasma membrane forming a clathrin-coated vesicle that then uncoats and typically fuses to an <b>early</b> <b>endosome.</b> Once fused the endocytosed cargo (receptor and/or ligand) can then be sorted to lysosomal, recycling, or other trafficking pathways.|$|E

40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein in {{filamentous}} fungi accumulates at microtubule plus-ends {{near the}} hyphal tip, {{which is important}} for minus-end-directed transport of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> It was hypothesized that dynein is switched on at the plus-end by cargo association. Here, we show in Aspergillus nidulans that kinesin- 1 -dependent plus-end localization is not a prerequisite for dynein ATPase activation. First, the Walker A and Walker B mutations in the dynein heavy chain AAA 1 domain implicated in blocking different steps of the ATPase cycle cause different effects on dynein localization to microtubules, arguing against the suggestion that ATPase is inactive before arriving at the plus-end. Second, dynein from kinA (kinesin 1) mutant cells has normal ATPase activity {{despite the absence of}} dynein plus-end accumulation. In kinA hyphae, dynein localizes along microtubules and does not colocalize with abnormally accumulated <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> at the hyphal tip. This is in contrast to the colocalization of dynein and <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> in the absence of NUDF/LIS 1. However, the Walker B mutation allows dynein to colocalize with the hyphal-tip-accumulated <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> in the kinA background.

40|$|The {{tyrosine}} kinase substrate annexin II {{is a member}} of a multigene family of Ca 2 + and lipid-binding proteins which have been implicated in a number of membrane-related events. We have analyzed the subcellular distribution of annexin II in relation to other cellular components in normal and specifically manipulated MDCK cells. In a polarized monolayer of MDCK cells annexin II and its cellular ligand p 11 are restricted almost exclusively to the cortical regions of the cells which also contain peripheral <b>early</b> <b>endosomes.</b> Treatment of the polarized cells with low Ca 2 + medium leads to a disintegration of the cortical cytoskeleton and a translocation of both, the annexin II 2 p 11 (2) complex and <b>early</b> <b>endosomes,</b> to the cytoplasm. A similar translocation which is however specific for the annexin II 2 p 11 (2) complex and <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> and does not affect other elements of the cell cortex is observed in cells expressing a trans-dominant annexin II- p 11 mutant. This chimeric mutant protein causes the aggregation of endogenous annexin II and p 11 and the simultaneous detachment of <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> from the cell periphery resulting in the binding of the <b>early</b> <b>endosomes</b> but no other components of the endocytotic or biosynthetic pathways to the annexin II/p 11 aggregates.

The LDL remains in the endosome and is delivered to lysosomes for processing. LDL dissociates because of the slightly acidified environment of the <b>early</b> <b>endosome,</b> generated by a vacuolar membrane proton pump V-ATPase. On the other hand, EGF and the EGF receptor have a pH-resistant bond that persists until it is delivered to lysosomes for their degradation.

In contrast, homotypic fusion of <b>early</b> or late <b>endosomes</b> is microtubule-independent. Finally, this stimulation by microtubules depends on microtubule-associated proteins and requires the presence of the minus-end directed motor cytoplasmic dynein, but not the plus-end directed motor kinesin, in agreement with the microtubule organization in vivo.
