Archeological evidence indicates a continuous occupation of the site from the Bronze Age to the Roman period and the site is well-known, thanks to the existence of a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Artemis. Based on the study of four boreholes, a paleogeographic reconstruction of the coastal landscape is proposed. Facies were determined based on mollusc identification, and sedimentology based on grain-size measurements (<b>hand</b> <b>sieving</b> for the fraction above 2 [*]mm and LASER technique for particles below 2 [*]mm) and loss-on-ignition.

40|$|The {{particle}} size of ground grain per-forms {{a critical role}} in determining feed digestibility, mixing performance, and pelleting. Therefore, periodic {{particle size}} evaluation is a neces-sary component of a feed manufacturing quality assurance pro-gram. The purpose of this bulletin is to de-scribe the equipment, procedure, costs, and interpretation of particle size analysis. Equipment The equipment required for particle size analysis includes a scale, shaker, sieves, sieve cleaners, and brushes. A scale that is accurate to ± 0. 1 grams is required (ASAE, 1993). There are two types of scales avail-able: electronic and triple-beam balance. A triple-beam balance costs approximately $ 600 less than an electronic top-loading balance. The recommended sieve shaker is a Tyler RoTap (Mentor, OH). The RoTap mechanically reproduces the circular motion that occurs during <b>hand</b> <b>sieving,</b> {{while at the same time}} tapping the sieve stack to help the particles fall through the mesh screens. It is de-signed to hold a maximum of six full-height (13 half-height), 8 -inch diameter sieves and a pan (Tyler, 1976). A less expensive portable sieve shaker also is manufactured by the Tyler company. It is similar to the RoTap, but it does not have the tapping mecha-nism. It has the same capacity as the RoTap. When using a portable sieve shaker, sufficient action is pro-duced if the wing nuts are tightened approximately 1 / 16 inch above the sieve stack. A stack of sieves (each sieve possessing a differ-ent diameter opening) separates feed particles accord-ing to size.

40|$|Due to the {{combined}} effect {{of wind and}} rain, the importance of storm movement to surface flow has long been recognized, at scales ranging from headwater scales to large basins. This study {{presents the results of}} laboratory experiments designed to investigate the influence of moving rainfall storms on the dynamics of sediment transport by surface runoff. Experiments were carried out, using a rain simulator and a soil flume. The movement of rainfall was generated by moving the rain simulator at a constant speed in the upstream and downstream directions along the flume. The main objective {{of the study was to}} characterize, in laboratory conditions, the distribution of sediment grain-size transported by rainfall-induced overland flow and its temporal evolution. Grain-size distribution of the eroded material is governed by the capacity of flow that transports sediments. Granulometric curves were constructed using conventional <b>hand</b> <b>sieving</b> and a laser diffraction particle size analyser (material below 0. 250 mm) for overland flow and sediment deliveries collected at the flume outlet. Surface slope was set at 2 %, 7 % and 14 %. Rainstorms were moved with a constant speed, upslope and downslope, along the flume or were kept static. The results of laboratory experiments show that storm movement, affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, has a marked influence on the grain-size characteristics of sediments transported by overland flow. The downstream-moving rainfall storms have higher stream power than do other storm types.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{influences}} {{and land use}} practices in eastern Australia over the past 200 years have resulted in vastly altered channel and catchment conditions. This has not only reduced geomorphic diversity but also vegetation diversity and ecological functioning. As such, identifying the impact of various land use regimes is highly important when developing future riparian zone management strategies. To investigate the influence land use (specifically grazing) has on the riparian zone and river system, 12 in-channel river deposits were studied on the Hunter River between Muswellbrook and Aberdeen. Three land use types were selected — i) never grazed, ii) crash grazed and iii) perennially grazed — and samples were taken at three study reaches (Aberdeen, Downstream Aberdeen and Dart Brook Mine). One hundred and eleven (111) soil samples were collected from bars and benches {{in order to determine}} organic carbon content and fine sediment retention. The soil samples were analysed using loss-on-ignition (LOI) testing to determine the percentage (%) of organic carbon (OC). The Malvern Mastersizer was used to analyse average grain size and to determine the dominant sediment fraction within each soil sample. <b>Hand</b> <b>sieves</b> (- 4 phi and - 1 phi) were used to determine the main sediment fractions as a measure of bar variability. Spatial and hydrologic analyses were undertaken to determine historical and recent changes in both vegetation and river geomorphology. Results from the sample analysis showed that sites that had never been grazed had an average increased OC concentration of 6. 43 % and were also comprised of the finest sediment (FS), at 108. 7 m. Study locations that had been subjected to controlled grazing (3. 02 % OC and FS 324. 4 m) fell on average between permanently grazed (2. 68 % OC and FS 376. 4 m) and never-grazed locations across most variables analysed. Riparian zone management is a prevalent and important topic and these results provide guidance for developing management strategies. It has been found that stock may be useful in removing exotic vegetation {{as part of a larger}} weed management program, however in doing so they may decrease the amount of carbon sequestered and fine sediment retained. Decreased organic carbon can affect the nutrient cycling and the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from water prior to entering the stream. In addition, decreased fine sediment retention may result in increased turbidity and therefore decreased light availability throughout the water column. These results may also have implications on global carbon storage through the riparian zone and its associated role in mitigating climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of variables in a flotation technique for the recovery of Toxocara canis eggs from soil. The trials were done under standardized conditions on one gram of previously sterilized soil samples contaminated with 200 eggs of T. canis. The following variables were evaluated in serial steps: sieving; type of wash; time of stirring; resuspension of sediment; solution flotation. Centrifuge-flotation in sodium nitrate (d = 1. 20 g/cm 3) was adopted as an initial technique, using Tween 80 (0. 2 %) and decinormal sodium hydroxide as solutions for washing the samples. Ten tests were done to compare the variables, using counting in triplicate. The sieving of the material reduced significantly the recovery of eggs (p < 0. 001) and the number of eggs recovered was higher when the sediment was resuspended (p < 0. 05). After standardization, flotation solutions sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, sodium dichromate, magnesium sulfate, and sodium nitrate (d = 1. 20 g/cm 3) were compared. The best results were obtained by using zinc sulfate solution. In conclusion, the chances of recovering T. canis eggs from samples using flotation solutions can be increased by washing of soil twice using distilled water, and resuspension of sediment. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>sieving</b> procedure can drastically reduce the number of eggs...|$|R

The new data have resulted in an emended diagnosis. The megaspore is partly covered by filosum and the wall lacks excrescences. The exoperine is highly variable with nodular, to clavate, baculate and tabulate elements, which fuse to form a foveolate to reticulate megaspore surface, which is complex and contorted. Glochidia on the microspore massulae are sometimes septate and the flukes on their anchor-shaped tips are variable, some being long, narrow and wavy, others shorter and broad and a few are recurved. Hairs are lacking on the massula surface and glochidia. The organization of the float zone of the megaspore apparatus has always been controversial with 0, 1, 3 or 9 floats proposed. The new results show {{that there are no}} pseudovacuolate floats. By contrast, the ‘float’ zone consists of bundles of modified granular and filamentous endoperine elements surrounded by bundles of broader suprafilosum hairs. The absence of pseudovacuolate floats in A. primaeva is suggested to be an important character for phylogenetic analyses. The high variability in glochidia tips, glochidia septa and exoperine organisation is unusual within the genus Azolla.

40|$|Since it is {{difficult}} to conduct railway ballast testing in-situ, it is important to simulate the conditions experienced in the real track environment and study their influences on ballast in a controlled experimental manner. In this research, extensive laboratory tests were performed on three types of ballast, namely granites A and B and limestone. The grading of the tested ballast conforms to the grading specification in The Railway Specification RT/CE/S/ 006 Issue 3 (2000). The major laboratory tests in this research were used to simulate the traffic loading and tamping maintenance undertaken by the newly developed Railway Test Facility (RTF) and large-scale triaxial test facility. The Railway Test Facility is a railway research facility that is housed in a 2. 1 m (width) x 4. 1 m (length) x 1. 9 m (depth) concrete pit and comprises subgrade material, ballast, and three sleepers. The sleepers are loaded with out of phase sinusoidal loading to simulate traffic loading. The ballast in the facility can also be tamped by a tamping bank which is a modified real Plasser tamping machine. Ballast breakage in the RTF was quantified by placing columns of painted ballast beneath a pair of the tamping tines, in the location where the other pair of tamping tines squeeze, and under the rail seating. The painted ballast was collected by <b>hand</b> and <b>sieved</b> after each test. It was found from the RTF tests that the amount of breakage generated from the tests was not comparable to the fouling in the real track environment. This is because the external input (such as wagon spillage and airborne dirt) which is the major source of fouling material {{was not included in the}} tests. Furthermore, plunging of the tamping tines caused more damage to the ballast than squeezing. The tested ballast was also subjected to Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA) and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) tests. It was found that the LAA and MDA values correlated well with the ballast damage from tamping and could indicate the durability of ballast. The large-scale triaxial test machine was specially manufactured for testing a cylindrical ballast sample with 300 -mm diameter and 450 -mm height and can perform both cyclic and monotonic tests with constant confining stress. Instead of using on-sample instrumentations to measure the radial movement of the sample, it measures sample volume change by measuring a head difference between the level of water that surrounds the sample and a fixed reference water level with a differential pressure transducer. The test results from cyclic tests were related to the simulated traffic loading test in the RTF by an elastic computer model. Even with some deficiencies, the model could relate the stress condition in the RTF to cyclic triaxial test with different confining stresses and q/p' stress ratios.

40|$|Silo or Bin is used very {{widely in}} Mining, Processing, Pharmaceutical, Cement, Ceramics and Packaging industries. The {{purpose of the}} silo is to hold {{material}} until it is ready to use in subsequent processes such as processing, chemical, physical or transport. According to the Oxford Dictionary (DK illustrated), a Silo is a pit or airtight structure in which green crops are kept for fodder {{or it can be}} a pit or a tower for the storage of grains,cement etc, or it is an underground storage chamber for guided missiles. The capacity of a silo may vary from Kgs. to Tons. In this research, a silo is used as a conical shaped container with an orifice through which mineral sands of varying sizes were allowed to pass and their flow behavior were examined with respect to their material physical properties and silo parameters. In the first stage of the project, the flow behavior was studied using beach mineral sands with glass funnels with orifice diameters 3. 5, 4. 8 and 8. 0 mm and heights 8, 10 and 24 cm respectively to simulate silos of varying orifice. The capillary part of the funnels were cut uniformly at the neck regions to prepare them for the tests. It was decided to use naturally occurring geo-materials of different mineralogical, chemical, and physical characteristics for the investigation. For this purpose, samples of beach sand from several locations along the western coast of Sri Lanka were collected and sampled using the sampler riffler, thereafter sieved through 2 mm sieve to remove sea shells and other extraneous impurities followed by spiral separation and tabling. Subsequently, magnetic separation and high tension separation were carried out to separate magnetic and non magnetic fractions according to the standard procedure. The fractions separated consisted of ilmenite, rutile, garnet and zircon. A sample of silica was also obtained from the glass sand deposit at Naththandiya. Each sand sample was sifted using the standard test sieves. Before conducting the flow properties of these minerals they were dried at 110 °C for 2 hours and the test was conducted 3 times and the average flow rate obtained thus was plotted against the particle size and the diD ratio for each material. Where, d = average particle size diameter and, D = funnel orifice diameter. Interpretation of flow rate measurements and analysis of data indicate that all beach mineral sands used in the study had the same flow rate pattern. The mass flow rate vs diD curves consisted of three significant zones representing bridging effect, constant gradient zone with a negative gradient and the no-flow zone, which spilled over to the fine particle fractions. The effects of charge particle nature, moisture contained, repose angle, surface morphology of mineral and the orifice diameter of the funnel on the flow properties were also investigated. As the particles studied were naturally occurring, they were sub-angular having rounded edges. Another series of experiments were conducted using spherically shaped silica gel particles having diameters 1. 2, 2. 2, and 3. 3 mm respectively. In the second stage, a pilot plant {{in the form of a}} conical silo was fabricated in the workshop and the experiments were conducted using mineral samples each sample weighed approximately 3 to 6 kg. The samples for the second stage was obtained from two sources, Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd and the river sand pits at lngiriya. After a tedious process of size separation mostly involving sorting of particles of different size fractions by <b>hand</b> picking and <b>sieving.</b> The results obtained agree very closely with those obtained using the glass funnels. It is evident that there are three zones in the performance curve -flow rate vs particle size with the bridging effect region corresponding to diD ratios of 1 / 4 to 115 for relatively larger size particles and the region exhibiting the 'floc effect' resulting from residual charges in the fine sizes and air trapped within the floes. The mineral particles used were pre-dried (dried at 110 °C for two hours). However, the presence of moisture in the powder seems to have a significant contribution on the flow rate. - The importance of the performance curve and its characteristic features have been discussed and also the relevance of the performance curve in designing silos...|$|R
