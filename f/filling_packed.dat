A coolant temperature control system has been designed for the control of cavity pressure during the cooling phase. Alternative variables have been defined to describe changes in cavity pressure during the cooling phase. The concept of controlled pressure cooling time (CPCT) has been defined and selected as the most appropriate controlled variable. The dynamics of CPCT have been studied in relation to coolant temperature. A control system for CPCT has been designed and implemented. Finally, the paper shows that the control of CPCT is an effective approach for the control of cavity pressure during cooling...|$|R

50|$|The 1991 {{study was}} {{followed}} by a more detailed BART Seismic Vulnerability Study, published in 2002, which concluded the <b>fill</b> <b>packed</b> around the tube might be prone to soil liquefaction during an intense earthquake, which could allow the buoyant hollow tube to break loose from its anchorages or cause movement that would exceed the capacity of the sliding seismic joints. Retrofitting work required the fill to be compacted, to make it denser and less prone to liquefaction. Compaction started in Summer 2006 at the east end of the Tube, on property belonging to the Port of Oakland. A 2010 paper concluded the distance the Tube would rise due to liquefaction was limited based on model testing of potential liquefaction mechanisms, and questioned the justification for the compaction effort.|$|R

The dynamics of cavity pressure during filling were investigated and found to be both nonlinear and time-varying in relation to the hydraulic servo-valve opening, which is the manipulated variable. A self-tuning control system was designed and tested for a wide range of conditions. The transition from <b>filling</b> to <b>packing</b> was best detected by the change in the derivative of cavity pressure.

40|$|Cooling {{accounts}} for {{a large amount of}} the global primary energy consumption in buildings and industrial processes. A substantial part of this cooling demand is produced by mechanical cooling towers. Simulations benefit the sizing and integration of cooling towers in overall cooling networks.

In this paper, a new model is developed for a mechanical draught cooling tower with both a cooling coil and a <b>fill</b> <b>pack.</b> The model needs manufacturers' performance data at only three operational states (at varying air and water flow rates) to be parametrized. The model predicts the cooled, outgoing water temperature. These predictions were compared with experimental data {{for a wide range of}} operational states.

Two engraving tool steel inserts were tested during the production of standard test specimens, each under the same processing conditions. By closely comparing the captured AE signals on both engraving inserts during the <b>filling</b> and <b>packing</b> stages, {{we were able to}} detect the presence of macro-cracks on one engraving insert.

40|$|Continuous {{improvements}} in product quality and production cost savings {{are crucial to}} maintaining a competitive edge in the injection molding industry. To reduce high-run production costs, automation can be employed to reduce the cycle time of molding, part inspection and verification, and machine setup. A fundamental step in the automation and optimization of any plastic injection process is to precisely design, measure and monitor the injection molding process such that key process variables are observable and controllable. This research paper investigated the measurement of two key process variables during the production process: in-mold/cavity pressure and temperature. Results of the in-mold pressure and temperature profiles demonstrated excellent affinity and high repeatability with the typical trends for their class of polymers. The in-cavity pressure profiles corresponded well with the <b>filling,</b> <b>packing,</b> and holding points of the machine pressure profile.

40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} history {{experienced by}} plastics melts and solids during processing {{leads to the}} development of microstructure, which directly influences the ultimate properties of the plastic articles. Therefore, besides the predictions of thermomechanical history, the prediction of microstructure represents an important aspect of the modeling of plastics processing. A comprehensive model has been developed to describe the behaviour of thermoplastic polymer melts during the injection molding process. The model, which deals with the three stages of the process (<b>filling,</b> <b>packing</b> and cooling), employs a viscoelastic constitutive equation and incorporates crystallization kinetics. All the properties of the material employed are based on experimental data. The model predicts fill times, velocity, temperature and pressure distributions, the distribution of shear and normal stresses, and stress relaxation.

The biggest influence on the refraction index (n) and the difference of the refraction index (Δn) among part areas characterizing its optical heterogeneity is made by the runner system design whilst the principal factor influenced on birefringence is melt temperature.

40|$|Abstract:  Plastic {{injection}} moulding is vastly used in today’s manufacturing industry. It is a preferred method {{compared to other}} types of manufacturing processes because less surface finishing is needed for the parts produced by {{injection moulding}}. In manufacturing field, finishing processes such as surface treatment, metallization and heat treatments are carried out {{in order to improve}} the surface quality. The additional processes contribute to higher manufacturing costs and can be avoided by employing an automated process such as plastic injection moulding. The mould can be repeatedly used, making plastic injection moulding appropriate for mass production. The whole cycle time starts from <b>filling,</b> <b>packing,</b> cooling and part ejection (mould opening). Cooling phase takes more than 2 / 3 of the whole cycle time making it the most dominant factor among the other components of the cycle. The influence of cooling channels will be discussed by comparing straight drilling cooling channels (SDCC) with conformal cooling channels (CCC). A multi-cavity rectangular plate was analysed by employing 4 different cooling systems. Through-out the analyses, chilled water and thermoplastics which represent at least 90 % of all plastic were considered and set as constants...|$|R
