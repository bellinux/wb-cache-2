2500|$|English {{was not the}} {{dominant}} language of the world at that time, {{and the ability to}} read and speak more than one language was considered important for those who would excel. Therefore, the learning of Latin (considered to be the mother of Romance languages) was also a priority, as it was with grammar schools in England. [...] Seventeenth-century schoolboys throughout Europe, Catholic or Protestant, learned Latin, and which explains the [...] "Latin" [...] in [...] "Boston Latin." [...] The ability to read at least Cicero and Virgil was a requirement of all colonial colleges, and to write and speak such Latin in verse and prose {{was the first of the}} Harvard laws of 1642 (followed by Christian conversion). [...] Boston Latin prepared many students for admission to Harvard, with a total of seven years (on long wooden benches) being devoted to the classics, and providing almost one seventh (29) of Harvard members during just one period (1771 through 1774). [...] However, [...] most graduates of Boston Latin did not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> since business and professions did not require collegiate training, which more basic learning provided for.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} time period, Lewis Terman and others began to promote the use of tests such as Alfred Binet's in American schools. Terman in {{particular}} thought that such tests could identify an innate [...] "intelligence quotient" [...] (IQ) in a person. The results of an IQ test could then be used to find an elite group of students who would be {{given the chance to}} finish high school and <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> By the mid-1920s, the increasing use of IQ tests, such as the Army Alpha test administered to recruits in World War I, led the College Board to commission the development of the SAT. The commission, headed by Carl Brigham, argued that the test predicted success in higher education by identifying candidates primarily on the basis of intellectual promise rather than on specific accomplishment in high school subjects. In 1934, James Conant and Henry Chauncey used the SAT as a means to identify recipients for scholarships to Harvard University. Specifically, Conant wanted to find students, other than those from the traditional northeastern private schools, that could do well at Harvard. The success of the scholarship program and the advent of World War II led {{to the end of the}} College Board essay exams and to the SAT being used as the only admissions test for College Board member colleges.|$|E
