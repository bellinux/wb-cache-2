40|$|An {{evaluation}} method that can express the local leakage of leachate from <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in steel pipe sheet pile (SPSP) cutoff walls {{is discussed in}} this study. In particular, the evaluation of environmental feasibility (containment of leachates containing toxic substances) considering a three-dimensional arrangement and hydraulic conductivity distribution of the <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in the SPSP cutoff wall is compared with an evaluation that uses the equivalent hydraulic conductivity. This equivalent hydraulic conductivity assumes that the <b>joint</b> <b>section</b> and the steel pipe are integrated; therefore, the hydraulic conductivity is substituted with a uniform permeable layer. However, in an evaluation that employs the equivalent hydraulic conductivity, {{it is difficult to}} consider the local leakage of leachate containing toxic substances from the <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in the SPSP cutoff wall. It was established that evaluations of the environmental feasibility of SPSP cutoff walls with <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> must take into account the local leakage of leachates containing toxic substances from the <b>joint</b> <b>sections.</b> Also, it was clarified that technologies that lower the hydraulic conductivities of <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in SPSP cutoff walls and also facilitate the use of sparser joint arrangements contribute significantly to increasing the environmental feasibility of SPSP cutoff walls at landfill sites...|$|R

40|$|Assessing the shear {{strength}} of a joined ceramic or CMC is an essential task in components design. Indeed, what is needed for design purposes, is the true {{shear strength}}, while several standard tests only give conventional values, disregarding multiaxiality and non-uniformity of the actual stress distribution. If used under proper conditions, torsion test {{has the advantage of}} producing a state of pure shear stress with a known distribution in the <b>joint</b> <b>section.</b> A distinction must be done whether the joining material is brittle or ductile. In case of brittle behavior, the stress concentration factor due to the specimen geometry must be taken into account; moreover, since the stress state is intrinsically biaxial, failure may occur out of the <b>joint</b> <b>section.</b> In case of ductile behavior, the non-linear effect of plasticity must be included.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a single intravenous treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) encapsulated in long-circulating PEG-liposomes on both joint inflammation and cartilage destruction and to {{investigate the}} phenomenon of selective homing of these liposomes in the inflamed synovium. METHODS: Mice with collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA) were intravenously treated with liposomal and free prednisolone phosphate (PLP) {{a few days after the}} first signs of the disease. Joint inflammation was scored during 1 week after treatment, after which sections of the knee joints were prepared for assessment of cartilage damage. In addition, arthritic mice were treated with liposomes containing colloidal gold. 24 hours after injection, knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> were prepared in which the location of liposomes was visualised. RESULTS: Treatment of CIA with 10 mg/kg liposomal PLP resulted in a strong and lasting resolution of joint inflammation. 10 mg/kg free PLP only became slightly effective after repeated daily injections. Although joint inflammation recurred 1 week after treatment with liposomal PLP, knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> prepared at this time indicated that the cartilage damage was still reduced. Localisation of gold labelled liposomes in the inflamed joints was seen in the proximity of blood vessels, in the cellular infiltrate, but mainly in the synovial lining. Unaffected joints did not take up liposomes. CONCLUSIONS: By using the property of long-circulating liposomes to target the synovial lining selectively in inflamed joints, the anti-inflammatory activity of GC can be greatly increased, showing also the beneficial effect of reduced cartilage destruction...|$|R

40|$|Wim B. van den Berg* Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory joint disease, leading to cartilage and bone destruction. In this study, we investigated {{the effects of}} local IL- 4 application, introduced by a recombinant human type 5 adenovirus vector, in the knee joint of mice with collagen-induced arthritis. One intraarticular injection with an IL- 4 -expressing virus caused overexpression of IL- 4 in the mouse knee joint. Enhanced onset and aggravation of the synovial inflammation {{were found in the}} IL- 4 group. However, despite ongoing inflammation, histologic analysis showed impressive prevention of chondrocyte death and cartilage erosion. In line with this, chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis was enhanced in the articular cartilage. This was quantified with ex vivo 35 S-sulfate incorporation in patellar cartilage and confirmed by autoradiography on whole knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections.</b> Reduction of cartilage erosion was further substantiated by lack of expression of the stromelysin-dependent cartilage proteoglycan breakdown neoepitope VDIPEN in the Ad 5 E 1 mIL- 4 -treated knee joint. Reduced metalloproteinase activity was also supported by markedly diminished mRNA expression of stromelysin- 3 in the synovial tissue. Histologic analysis revealed marked reduction of polymorphonuclear cells in the synovial joint space in the IL- 4 -treated joints. This was confirmed by immunolocalization studies on knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> using NIMP-R 14 staining and diminished mRNA expression of macrophage-inflammatory protein- 2 in the synovium tissue. mRNA levels of TNF- � and IL- 1 � were suppressed as well, and IL- 1 � and nitric oxide production by arthritic synovial tissue were strongly reduced.
