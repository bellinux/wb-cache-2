5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E

After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E

5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 who had lived in the colony for at least six months. The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942. Part-time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55, with a small number of exceptions <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> reserved occupations. On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), {{in a manner similar to}} the Article XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E
