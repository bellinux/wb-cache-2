5|$|The larvae of many <b>hoverfly</b> species principally {{feed upon}} aphids, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their {{effectiveness}} in commercial crops {{has not been}} studied.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of <b>hoverfly</b> are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless <b>hoverfly</b> mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
50|$|Pipiza is a genus <b>Hoverflies,</b> {{from the}} family Syrphidae, in the order Diptera. Most are dark <b>hoverflies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mimicry of bees or wasps in shape, and {{colouration}} {{is shown}} by other <b>hoverflies,</b> and this is thought to protect against falling prey to birds and other insectivores which avoid eating true wasps because of their stings. However, the difference between <b>hoverflies</b> and wasps or bees is <b>hoverflies</b> have two wings, and the Hymenoptera species have four.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hoverflies</b> are {{important}} pollinators of flowering plants worldwide. Often <b>hoverflies</b> {{are considered to}} be the second most important pollinators after wild bees. Although <b>hoverflies</b> as a whole are generally considered to be nonselective pollinators, some species have more specialized relationships. The orchid species Epipactis veratrifolia mimics alarm pheromones of aphids to attract hover flies for pollination. Another plant, the slipper orchid in southwest China, also achieves pollination by deceit by exploiting the innate yellow colour preference of syrphide.|$|R
5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for {{many species of}} mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian mimicry, where the mimic is also distasteful, and the mimicry can be considered mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include many species of <b>hoverfly</b> and the wasp beetle. Many species of wasp are involved in Müllerian mimicry, as are many species of bee.|$|E
5|$|This motion {{camouflage}} {{strategy was}} discovered and modelled as algorithms in 1995 by M. V. Srinivasan and M. Davey {{while they were}} studying mating behaviour in hoverflies. The male <b>hoverfly</b> appeared to be using the tracking technique to approach prospective mates. Motion camouflage has been observed in high-speed territorial battles between dragonflies, where males of the Australian emperor dragonfly, Hemianax papuensis were seen to choose their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals in 6 of 15 encounters. They made use of both real-point and infinity-point strategies.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are {{parasitised}} by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume {{them as part of}} a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies. Many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of <b>hoverfly</b> are myrmecophilous, their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee flies such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E
50|$|Mimicry: Many {{species have}} the trait known as mimicry which allows {{normally}} harmless creatures to appear dangerous. Harmless <b>hoverflies</b> are {{an example of}} a species that exhibits mimicry. <b>Hoverflies</b> mimic the look and sound of wasps. Though most of them resemble the wasps very closely, others barely pass as looking like the wasps. In order to solve this Darwinian puzzle of why certain <b>hoverflies</b> do not resemble the wasps closely, Canadian researchers conducted a study. In this study the researchers determined that larger <b>hoverflies</b> will closely resemble the wasps where the smaller species barely mimic them. This was determined to be due to the larger species having a greater threat of being attacked by birds. The smaller species do {{not have to worry about}} closely impersonating the wasps as much because the birds will not even bother to try to attack them due to their size. Since the larger <b>hoverflies</b> impersonate the wasps, they will have a greater chance of surviving and will therefore increase their fitness.|$|R
5000|$|The adult <b>hoverflies</b> can {{be found}} from April to November. [...] The larvae feed on aphids, while adult <b>hoverflies</b> feed on nectar and pollen of various species of Asteraceae, {{as well as on}} Heracleum sphondylium, Galeopsis tetrahit, Malva moschata and Parnassia palustris.|$|R
5000|$|The Pipizini is a {{tribe of}} small to {{medium-sized}} generally black <b>hoverflies</b> though some species have orange {{spots on the}} abdomen. [...] This nondescript colouring can lead to some species being confused with other dark <b>hoverflies</b> from other tribes. The lack of a facial knob is a good defining feature which separates them from most of these other <b>hoverflies.</b> As with the Syrphinae the larvae feed on aphids though {{there seems to be}} a preference for wax-secreting aphids e.g. Pemphigidae.|$|R
25|$|Post-war, RAF Andover {{continued}} {{to be used for}} helicopter flying training and operational research, C Flight of 657 Squadron, Army Air Corps, being renamed 1901 Flight in February 1947. The Flight used six Sikorsky R-6A <b>Hoverfly</b> 2 (an improved version of the <b>Hoverfly</b> I) helicopters, and Auster AOP.6 aircraft to train British Army and Royal Air Force pilots and carry out operational trials. The <b>Hoverfly</b> 2s had little effective operational capability, but gave the Army valuable experience in the helicopter's potential use. In addition to artillery direction, the Flight's experimental activities included photography, radar trials, air/ground communications, and fighter evasion. In January 1948, the Flight moved to Middle Wallop. It still exists today as 1 Flight, Army Air Corps.|$|E
25|$|Natural enemies include predatory ladybugs, <b>hoverfly</b> larvae, {{parasitic}} wasps, aphid midge larvae, crab spiders, lacewings, and entomopathogenic fungi such as Lecanicillium lecanii and the Entomophthorales.|$|E
25|$|Bumblebees form Mullerian {{rings of}} species, {{and they do}} often exhibit polymorphism. The <b>hoverfly</b> species {{mimicking}} bumblebees are generally accurate mimics, {{and many of their}} species are polymorphic. Many of the polymorphisms are different between the sexes, for example by the mimicry being limited to one sex only.|$|E

25|$|Badgers (Meles meles) destroy Vespula rufa nests, {{consuming}} the occupants, combs, and envelope. The wasps stings don't threaten badgers {{as thick}} skin and body hair {{protect them from}} stings. Great tits (Parus major) are also predators of V. rufa, digging their nests out of cavities. The larvae of Volucella pellucens (a <b>hoverfly)</b> act as scavengers.|$|E
25|$|Agents of {{biological}} control include {{a number of}} parasitoid wasps that attack the nymphs, including Leptomastidea abnormis, Leptomastix dactylopii, Chrysoplatycerus splendens, and Anagyrus pseudococci. Predators include the brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi, the green lacewing Chrysopa lateralis, <b>hoverfly</b> larvae, and the scale-feeding snout-moth larva. The mealybug destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), a ladybird beetle, readily attacks the citrus mealybug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hoverfly</b> mimics {{can be seen}} {{in almost}} any garden in the {{temperate}} zone. The Syrphidae are a large (5600+ species) family of flies; their imagoes feed on nectar and pollen, and are well known for their mimicry of social hymenoptera. The mimicry is Batesian in nature: hoverflies are palatable but hymenoptera are generally unpalatable and may also be protected by stingers and/or armour.|$|E
50|$|About 6,000 {{species in}} 200 genera have been described. <b>Hoverflies</b> are common {{throughout}} the world {{and can be found}} on all continents except Antarctica. <b>Hoverflies</b> are harmless to most other animals, despite their mimicry of more dangerous wasps and bees, which wards off predators.|$|R

25|$|In May 1947, 705 Squadron was re-commissioned at RNAS Gosport {{with the}} Sikorsky <b>Hoverfly</b> element from 771 NAS. At first the {{squadron}} operated as a fleet requirements unit, and {{was responsible for}} the evaluation of the helicopter for use at sea. On 1 February 1947 Lieutenant K Reed carried out the first helicopter deck landing on a Royal Navy ship when he landed on HMS Vanguard off Portland.|$|E
25|$|Vespula vulgaris {{are subject}} to {{predation}} by the honey buzzard, which excavates the nests to obtain the larvae. The <b>hoverfly</b> Volucella pellucens {{and some of its}} relatives lay their eggs in a wasp nest, and their larvae feed on the wasps’ young and dead adults. Spiders are yet another predator of this and many other species. A species of parasitic mite, Varroa destructor jacobsoni, was found on larvae of this species in Poland in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The RAF Museum {{preserves}} {{a number}} of individual aircraft which were based at RAF Andover during their service lives: a Sikorsky R-4B <b>Hoverfly</b> I; an Avro Anson C. 19; a De Havilland Dove C. 1; a Percival Pembroke C. 2; and, unusually, two Luftwaffe aircraft captured in 1944, a Junkers Ju 87 G-2 dive bomber and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 G-4 night fighter. The National Museum of Flight in Scotland preserves RAF Andover's former gate guardian, a Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. XVIE.|$|E

25|$|Bates' work on Amazonian {{butterflies}} led him {{to develop}} the first scientific account of mimicry, especially the kind of mimicry which bears his name: Batesian mimicry. This is the mimicry by a palatable species of an unpalatable or noxious species. A common example seen in temperate gardens is the <b>hoverfly,</b> many of which—though bearing no sting—mimic the warning colouration of hymenoptera (wasps and bees). Such mimicry {{does not need to}} be perfect to improve the survival of the palatable species.|$|E
25|$|Observers in {{a garden}} can see for {{themselves}} that <b>hoverfly</b> mimics are quite common, usually many times more common than the models, and are (to our sight) relatively poor mimics, often easy to distinguish from real wasps. However, it {{has been established in}} other cases that imperfect mimicry can confer significant advantage to the mimic, especially if the model is really noxious. Also, not only is polymorphism absent from these mimics, it is absent in the wasps also: these facts are presumably connected.|$|E
25|$|RAF Andover has {{a unique}} place in British history, as the first British {{military}} unit to be equipped with helicopters, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 at RAF Andover {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader B.H. Arkell. This was also the first European helicopter flying-training school, however the first European military unit formed solely with helicopters was the Luftwaffe's Transportstaffel 40 in 1944. The Helicopter Training School was equipped with nine Sikorsky R-4B <b>Hoverfly</b> I helicopters, and trained 100 British Army pilots for Air Observation Post duties, as well as pilots for the first RAF squadron to be equipped with helicopters, 529 Squadron, which carried our radar calibration duties. Radar calibration duties were later carried out by the Hawker Siddeley Andover and Air Observation Post duties are today carried out by the Army Air Corps.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{a number}} of {{fascinating}} interactions occur between orchids and <b>hoverflies.</b> The orchid species Epipactis veratrifolia mimics alarm pheromones of aphids to attract <b>hoverflies</b> for pollination.

40|$|Interesting new {{records of}} <b>hoverflies</b> in TheNetherlands (Diptera: Syrphidae) The {{preliminary}} distribution atlas of the Dutch <b>hoverflies</b> (NJN 1998) marked {{the start of}} the Syrphidae recording scheme (1998 - 2002). This publication {{has proven to be a}} major stimulus for the study of this interesting group of flies. Many interesting new data from field and collection work have become known since 1998. In this paper a selection of published and unpublished records is summarized. At the end of the project all available knowledge on Dutch <b>hoverflies</b> will be compiled in the Dutch Syrphidae atlas...|$|R
