5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by two characters in the 1782 French epistolary novel Les Liaisons dangereuses, written by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos: the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. In the song, the voice heard on the chorus of the song which repeats [...] "It's beyond my control" [...] {{is in fact a}} sample of <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich's</b> voice from the film [...] "Dangerous Liaisons" [...] by Stephen Frears.|$|R
5000|$|Stephanie Savage, {{one of the}} {{television}} series' creators, described him as [...] "entertaining and observationally smart, he's the friend who says {{all the things you}} want to say but can't, and he tempts you in ways, at that age, you want to be tempted." [...] She compared his relationship with Blair to Glenn Close and <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich's</b> in Dangerous Liaisons. She found Westwick's portrayal of Chuck was similar to James Spader of Pretty in Pink and Robert Downey, Jr..|$|R

5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Eragon {{was released in}} the United States on December 15, 2006. Plans to create the film were first announced in February 2004, when 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to Eragon. The film was directed by first-timer Stefen Fangmeier, and written by Peter Buchman. Edward Speleers was selected {{for the role of}} Eragon. Over the following months, Jeremy Irons, <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich,</b> Chris Egan and Djimon Hounsou were all confirmed as joining the cast. Principal photography for the film took place in Hungary and Slovakia.|$|E

He received his substantial role in the 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask, where he played Raoul, the ill-fated son of <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich's</b> dueling Musketeer, Athos. The film uses characters from Alexandre Dumas' d'Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. The film received ambivalent reviews, but was a success at the box office, earning $182million worldwide.|$|R

5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich's</b> production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|R
5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich,</b> and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, the British {{historical}} drama The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, {{in which}} she portrayed Mother Elsa Hoess, was released worldwide. Farmiga won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for her performance. That same year she starred in the British-Russian war drama In Transit alongside <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich,</b> and portrayed Central Intelligence Agency operative Erica Van Doren in the political thriller Nothing But the Truth. The role earned Farmiga a nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
5|$|Several actors {{campaigned for}} the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich,</b> Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. While some {{characters}} are composites, most {{are based on}} actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded {{a few weeks later}} in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In post-production, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Travers, in {{his review}} for Rolling Stone said of <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich's</b> performance: [...] "Of course, no one could guess {{the extent to which}} Malkovich is now capable of chewing scenery. He surpasses even his eyeballrolling as Cyrus the Virus in Con Air. Munching Oreo cookies, {{splashing}} the pot with chips (a poker no-no) and speaking with a Russian accent that defies deciphering ("Ho-kay, Meester sum of a beech"), Malkovich soars so far over the top, he's passing Pluto." [...] In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle said of Damon's performance: [...] "Mike should supply the drive the film otherwise lacks, and Damon doesn't. We might believe he can play cards, but we don't believe he needs to do it, in the way, say, that the 12-year-old Mozart needed to write symphonies. He's not consumed with genius. He's a nice guy with a skill." [...] In his review for the Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote: [...] "The main problem with Rounders is that the movie never quite knows what it is about: What is the moral ante?" ...|$|R
5|$|In 1980 Waterston's {{portrayal}} of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer {{in the television}} miniseries Oppenheimer saw him earn another Golden Globe nomination. Two years later, Waterston played American journalist Sydney Schanberg in the 1984 British drama The Killing Fields, opposite Haing S. Ngor and <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> – for his performance Waterston received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. His other biographical roles include Heaven's Gate as Old West figure Frank Canton (1980) and as President Abraham Lincoln in the miniseries Lincoln (1988), the 1990 documentary miniseries The Civil War, and the play Abe Lincoln in Illinois. His performance {{in the last of}} these garnered him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), {{directed}} by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by {{his failure to}} save John F. Kennedy's life. The film was among the top10 box office performers in that year, earning $102million in the United States alone. Later in 1993, he directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in A Perfect World. Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits the road with a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood's directing career, and the film has since been cited {{as one of his}} most underrated directorial achievements.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Spider-Man 3, Sony Pictures Entertainment had {{announced}} a May 5, 2011, release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series. By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had all written rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who wrote {{the second and third}} films, was working on yet another attempt. Raimi wanted <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> to play his next villain. However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew. Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich,</b> where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role, later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio. It was reported in December 2009 that <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. However, several years later, in 2013, Raimi stated that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made. Concept art revealed in June 2016 showed the inclusion of an opening montage of Spider-Man going up against C and D-list villains, such as Mysterio, the Shocker, the Prowler, and the Rhino, with the Vulture serving as the main antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{is widely}} {{referenced}} in popular culture, and the TV series The Simpsons {{is said to}} contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. Pop singer Lady Gaga's concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from A Clockwork Orange. Several films have been made related to Kubrick's life, including the mockumentary film Dark Side of the Moon (2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had {{been involved with the}} faked footage of the NASA moon landings during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Colour Me Kubrick (2005), starring <b>John</b> <b>Malkovich</b> as Alan Conway, a con artist who had assumed Kubrick's identity in the 1990s. Both films were authorized by Kubrick's family. In the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Kubrick was portrayed by Stanley Tucci, and documents their filming of Dr. Strangelove, rather than Lolita.|$|E
