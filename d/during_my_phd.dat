5000|$|While {{working with}} Kosterlitz at Aberdeen, Hughes helped {{discover}} the enkephalin peptides. Kosterlitz had developed assays for responses to opiate drugs, using pieces of guinea pig intestine and mouse vas deferens. Hughes {{sought to determine}} whether molecules present in brains could mimic {{the effects of the}} drugs. Reflecting in 1995 about that time, Hughes said: [...] "From my personal point of view, I think that the reason I got interested in searching for an endogenous opioid-like substance is that I had been previously involved <b>during</b> <b>my</b> <b>PhD</b> student work in looking at non-adrenergic, noncholinergic innervation of various blood vessels and that's what my PhD thesis waseventually written on." [...] He would bicycle daily to a slaughterhouse, where he would trade bottles of whiskey to the butchers in exchange for pig heads, and he subsequently prepared brain extracts using acetone. After testing many samples in Kosterlitz's assays, the two scientists were able to isolate and identify two peptides, met- and leu-enkephalin, as naturally occurring molecules from the brain, that have activity resembling opioids. Hughes and Kosterlitz first announced their findings at a scientific conference in May 1974, and published the structures of the two enkephalins in 1975. In 1978, they shared the Lasker award with Solomon H. Snyder, and Hughes in particular was credited with predicting the existence of endogenous opioids.|$|E
5000|$|FML was {{designed}} and developed by Giovanni Acampora during his Ph.D. course in Computer Science, at University of Salerno, Italy, in 2004. The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented {{one of the first}} concrete examples of Ambient Intelligence. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract fuzzy rules which could then be read directly into a fuzzy inference engine or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like XSLT, it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience <b>during</b> <b>my</b> <b>PhD,</b> I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and fuzzy inference engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work." ...|$|E
