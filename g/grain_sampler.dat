40|$|During {{the last}} decade much effort has been made on {{estimating}} the spatial variation of the grain quality in full-scale field trials exploring the potentials of real-time grain quality measuring systems. This has often been made by hand harvesting within a grid setup. However, when performing full-scale field trials it is preferable to collect the grain sample directly from the grain flow passing the yield meter of the combine. By doing {{so it will be}} possible to relate the yield registration directly from the yield monitor with the specific grain sample. A simple and inexpensive <b>grain</b> <b>sampler</b> was developed which required a minimal alteration of the combine itself. The paper describes the developed grain sampling system and how to calculated the positing of a collected grain sample taking combine delay time and the D-GPS receiver offsets into account enabling comparable sampling and yield registrations...|$|E

An outbreak of ergotism in Ethiopia in 1978 resulted from exposure to ergot alkaloids from C. puruprea sclerotia. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate consumption of cereal grains grown locally as the most likely cause of the outbreak of gangrenous ergotism so that control measures could be applied. Methods: During June to August, 2001, there were reports of a large number of cases of gangrene in Arsi Zone, Ethiopia. A multi-disciplinary team assessed the outbreak of the decease.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{determining}} {{the area of the}} exposed damage surface of grain endosperm by means of the amperometric measurement of iodine adsorption has been presented. According to the amperometric method, iodine is liberated by titrating standard potassium iodate into an acid solution containing potassium iodide and starch.

The elaborated method is based on a strict separation of a total adsorption of iodine by <b>grain</b> <b>sample</b> on its following parts: the grain coat adsorption and the exposed damage surface adsorption considering the coefficient of iodine adsorption by unit surface of damage endosperm. The separation of the total adsorption was possible owing the use of a test damage surface with measured area and a different soaking time of <b>grain</b> <b>sample.</b> Basing on this method three kinds of barley grain originating from various growth regions were evaluated. It was found that the total adsorption of iodine by tested grain is determined in a different degree by both features of coat and endosperm in relation to the origin of the grain. This fact indicates that only the surface area of the exposed damage can constitute an objective and accurate measure for this kind of mechanical damage of cereal grain...|$|R

The use of triangular and circular shaped seed crystals, however, modifies significantly the growth habit geometry of the grain.

This cereal is mainly used through traditional processing in family-based food systems in many regions of the world. We investigated in this study how pericarp thickness could be predicted by Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS), a fast and non-destructive measurement method that is commonly used to measure physico-chemical parameters of sorghum grains, and how this trait also influences the prediction of those parameters. We showed that, using a classification approach, {{it was possible to}} discriminate thick from thin pericarp whole <b>grain</b> <b>samples</b> with a good accuracy and that the proportion of thin and thick <b>grains</b> in mixed <b>samples</b> could also be predicted. In addition, pericarp thickness had a significant effect on the calibration performance for other grain parameters indicating that the pericarp can distort spectral information of whole <b>grain</b> <b>samples.</b> As a practical consequence, we suggest to develop separate whole grain calibration models for thin and thick pericarp samples, combined with a two-steps prediction approach to improve the accuracy of whole grain NIRS calibrations for grain quality parameters in sorghum.

In this study, we prepared samples of DON conjugated at the 10 - and 13 -positions with GSH, Cys, CysGly, γ-GluCys and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The mixtures of conjugates were used as standards for LC-HRMS analysis of one of the DON-treated wheat spikelet samples, as well as 19 Norwegian <b>grain</b> <b>samples</b> of spring wheat and 16 <b>grain</b> <b>samples</b> of oats that were naturally-contaminated with DON at concentrations higher than 1 mg/kg.

The identities of the conjugates were confirmed by LC-HRMS comparison with authentic standards, oxidation to the sulfoxides with hydrogen peroxide, and examination of product-ion spectra from LC-HRMS/MS analysis. No γ-GluCys adducts of DON were detected in any of the samples. The presence of 15 -O-acetyl-DON was demonstrated {{for the first time in}} Norwegian grain.
