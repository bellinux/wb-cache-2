40|$|The Drosophila Toll {{receptor}} {{is crucial}} for dorsoventral patterning in embryos, and for innate immunity. Toll also functions during central nervous system development, promoting neuronal survival and targeting. There are nine Toll paralogues in Drosophila, and it is unknown whether any of these also function in the CNS. Toll’s ligand, Spz, has an NGF domain. NGF is a vertebrate neurotrophin - a growth factor that regulates the development and function of the nervous system. Drosophila Neurotrophin 1 (DNT 1), identified by homology to the vertebrate neurotrophin BDNF, and DNT 2 are paralogues of spz. The three DNTs – DNT 1, DNT 2 and spz – are structural and functional homologues of vertebrate neurotrophins, and they promote neuronal survival, targeting and synaptogenesis in Drosophila.

The molecular mechanisms underlying differences in PA activities between normal and pathological synovial tissues have been further examined. METHODS: Synovial membranes from seven normal (N) subjects, 14 osteoarthritis (OA), and 10 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were analysed for plasminogen activator activity by conventional zymography and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> zymography on tissue sections. The tissue distribution of uPA, tPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1) was studied by immunohistochemistry. uPA, tPA, uPAR, and PAI- 1 mRNA values and mRNA distribution were assessed by northern blot and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridisations</b> respectively.

To address the molecular basis of Lhx 2 function, we generated HSC-like cell lines where Lhx 2 expression is regulated by a tet-on system and hence dependent {{on the presence of}} doxycyclin (dox). These cell lines efficiently down-regulate Lhx 2 expression upon dox withdrawal leading to a rapid differentiation into various myeloid cell types. Results Global gene expression of these cell lines cultured in dox was compared to different time points after dox withdrawal using microarray technology. We identified 267 differentially expressed genes. The majority of the genes overlapping with HSC-specific databases were those down-regulated after turning off Lhx 2 expression and a majority of the genes overlapping with those defined as late progenitor-specific genes were the up-regulated genes, suggesting that these cell lines represent a relevant model system for normal HSCs also at the level of global gene expression. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridisations</b> of several genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal showed overlapping expression patterns with Lhx 2 in various tissues during embryonic development.

40|$|Background: Cnidarians are a {{group of}} early {{branching}} animals including corals, jellyfish and hydroids that are renowned for their high regenerative ability, growth plasticity and longevity. Because cnidarian genomes are conventional in terms of protein-coding genes, their remarkable features are likely a consequence of epigenetic regulation. To facilitate epigenetics research in cnidarians, we analysed the histone complement of the cnidarian model organism Hydractinia echinata using phylogenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and mRNA <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridisations.</b> Results: We find that the Hydractinia genome encodes 19 histones and analyse their spatial expression patterns, genomic loci and replication-dependency. Alongside core and other replication-independent histone variants, we find several histone replication-dependent variants, including a rare replication-dependent H 3. 3, a female germ cell-specific H 2 A. X and an unusual set of five H 2 B variants, four of which are male germ cell-specific. We further confirm the absence of protamines in Hydractinia. Conclusions: Since no protamines are found in hydroids, we suggest that the novel H 2 B variants are pivotal for sperm DNA packaging in this class of Cnidaria. This study adds to {{the limited number of}} full histone gene complements available in animals and sets a comprehensive framework for future studies on the role of histones and their post-translational modifications in cnidarian epigenetics.

The tissue distribution of uPA, tPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1) was studied by immunohistochemistry. uPA, tPA, uPAR, and PAI- 1 mRNA values and mRNA distribution were assessed by northern blot and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridisations</b> respectively.  RESULTS—All normal and most OA synovial tissues expressed predominantly tPA catalysed proteolytic activity mainly associated to the synovial vasculature.

In this study, we investigated the expression of RyR mRNAs (ryr 1 - 3) during human pregnancy by examining myometrial samples (n= 18) taken, with informed consent and ethical approval, from non-pregnant patients undergoing hysterectomy, and patients undergoing elective caesarean section (at term, prior to or following the onset of labour). Ca 2 + release channel expression was determined both qualitatively and quantitatively, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, RNase protection assays, and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> mRNA <b>hybridisation.</b> RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that all three ryr genes, as well as the gene encoding the type I inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (InsP 3 RI), are expressed in human myometrium.

Several gliomas contained c/L-myc mRNAs at levels higher than those in fetal brain, L-myc predominantly in grade II/III and c-myc in grade III gliomas. High-level N-myc expression was detected.
