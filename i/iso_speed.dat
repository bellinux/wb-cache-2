For example, if a 35mm camera required 11, a 4×5 camera would require 45 to give the same DOF. For the same <b>ISO</b> <b>speed,</b> the exposure time on the 4×5 would be sixteen times as long; if the 35camera required 1/250 second, the 4×5 camera would require 1/15 second. The longer exposure time with the larger camera might result in motion blur, especially with windy conditions, a moving subject, or an unsteady camera.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, the {{proprietary}} formats {{used by many}} manufacturers break if the MakerNote tag is moved, i.e. {{by inserting}} or editing a tag that precedes it.

An example for this is Nikon's <b>ISO</b> <b>speed</b> settings tag.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} the use of f-numbers in {{photography}} is the sunny 16 rule: an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day by using an aperture of 16 and the shutter speed closest to the reciprocal of the <b>ISO</b> <b>speed</b> of the film; for example, using ISO 200 film, an aperture of 16 and a shutter speed of 1/200 second. The f-number may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light. Selecting a lower f-number is [...] "opening up" [...] the lens. Selecting a higher f-number is [...] "closing" [...] or [...] "stopping down" [...] the lens.|$|E

50|$|For a given <b>ISO</b> <b>speed</b> and meter {{calibration}} constant, {{there is}} a direct relationship between exposure value and luminance (or illuminance). Strictly, EV is not a measure of luminance or illuminance; rather, an EV corresponds to a luminance (or illuminance) for which a camera with a given <b>ISO</b> <b>speed</b> would use the indicated EV to obtain the nominally correct exposure. Nonetheless, it is common practice among photographic equipment manufacturers to express luminance in EV for ISO 100 speed, as when specifying metering range (Ray 2000, 318) or autofocus sensitivity. And the practice is long established; (Ray 2002, 592) cites Ulffers (1968) as an early example. Properly, the meter calibration constant as well as the <b>ISO</b> <b>speed</b> should be stated, but this seldom is done.|$|E
