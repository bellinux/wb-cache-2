5|$|The Native Americans' victory {{celebrations}} were short-lived. Public {{shock and}} outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's {{knowledge about the}} remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band {{across the border into}} the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E

25|$|This new strain {{appeared}} to be {{closely related to the}} strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: A/Victoria/75 (H3N2), which spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March. Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic, and urged President Gerald Ford that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. be vaccinated for the disease.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, {{computers}} {{became more}} popular. This was largely attributed to Microsoft {{and the release}} of Windows 95, which made using an IBM PC compatible computer much easier for home users. Windows 95 became so popular that in developed countries nearly every middle-class household had at least one computer. Similar to televisions and telephones, computers became a necessity to <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> information age.

The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round {{for a chance to}} win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.|$|E

25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before {{she would be able to}} give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

500|$|Ford {{was confronted}} with a {{potential}} swine flu pandemic. In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that [...] "swine flu" [...] was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States be vaccinated. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% {{of the population was}} vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976. The vaccine was blamed for twenty-five deaths; more people died from the shots than from the swine flu.|$|E
500|$|Chung {{developed}} Thirty Flights of Loving {{environment as}} a way to present the criminal nature of the group. He intentionally avoided the use of voice-overs, and instead modeled the environment to bridge [...] "the disconnect between the player's knowledge and the player's character's knowledge." [...] Characters Anita and Borges were to be introduced using dialogue, but this was removed. However, montages were later added after Idle Thumbs' crew expressed concerns that the characters' relationships were unclear. Chung included a system to automate the generation of non-playable characters to replace the process of manually scripting <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. He explained that although it allows characters to [...] "randomly wander near waypoints," [...] the software is [...] "occasionally glitchy and behaves badly around staircases." [...] This automation code was originally developed for a surveillance game prototype [...] "that never panned out." ...|$|E

500|$|Suppose one accepts, as I do, {{this line}} of {{reasoning}} as justifying governmental action to alleviate poverty; to set, as it were, a floor under the standard of life of <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community. [...] arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax.... The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual, namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure.|$|E
500|$|Betty, however {{difficult}} to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is [...] "dreck" [...] and [...] "hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress's commitment", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.|$|E

While singing [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", Cyrus wore a cropped blonde wig, a leotard with red, white, and blue sequins, a white cowboy hat, star spangled boots, {{and a set of}} fake teeth during the performance. The backup dancers were dressed as American monuments. Her performance received positive reviews from critics. Théoden Janes of The Charlotte Observer wrote, [...] "She turned a verse of Party in the U.S.A. into a cool, cocky rap" [...] and John J. Moser of The Morning Call said that the performance resonated with the audience, even though Cyrus was lifted atop a huge pedestal. Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun wrote, [...] "She went for a big ending, with fireworks, confetti, an elevating stage and dancers dressed as Abe Lincoln, Mount Rushmore, the Liberty Bell and The Statue of Liberty for the final older song Party in the U.S.A." [...] A critic from Nashville Scene wrote, [...] "Party in the U.S.A. was sung by Miley and screamed back by <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Cue red-white-and-blue confetti.
