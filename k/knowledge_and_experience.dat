5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{evaluation}} of progress with participatory approaches {{for improvement of}} health <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> health <b>experiences</b> of disadvantaged people in eight Districts of Eastern Nepal has been undertaken. Methods: A random selection of Village Development Committees and households, within the eight Districts where participation and a Rights-based Approach had been promoted specifically by local NGOs were compared with similar villages and households in eight Districts where this approach had not been promoted. Information was sought by structured interview <b>and</b> observation by <b>experienced</b> enumerators from both groups of householders. Health <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> were compared between {{the two sets of}} households. Adjustments were made for demographic confounders. Results: Complete data sets were available for 628 of the 640 households. Health <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> were low for both sets of households. However, health <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> were greater in the participatory households compared with the non-participatory households. These differences remained after adjustment for confounders. Conclusions: The study was designed to evaluate progress with participatory processes delivered by non-governmental organisations over a five year period. Improvements in health <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> of disadvantaged people were demonstrated in a consistent and robust manner where interventions had taken place. </p...|$|R

5|$|Marco knew four languages, and {{the family}} had {{accumulated}} {{a great deal of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> that was useful to Kublai. It is possible that he became a government official; he wrote about many imperial visits to China's southern and eastern provinces, the far south and Burma. They were highly respected and sought after in the Mongolian court, and so Kublai Khan decided to decline the Polos' requests to leave China. They became worried about returning home safely, believing that if Kublai died, his enemies might turn against them because of their close involvement with the ruler. In 1292, Kublai's great-nephew, then ruler of Persia, sent representatives to China in search of a potential wife, and they asked the Polos to accompany them, so they were permitted to return to Persia with the wedding party—which left that same year from Zaitun in southern China on a fleet of 14 junks. The party sailed to the port of Singapore, travelled north to Sumatra, and sailed west to the Point Pedro port of Jaffna under Savakanmaindan and to Pandyan of Tamilakkam. Eventually Polo crossed the Arabian Sea to Hormuz. The two-year voyage was a perilous one—of the six hundred people (not including the crew) in the convoy only eighteen had survived (including all three Polos). The Polos left the wedding party after reaching Hormuz and travelled overland to the port of Trebizond on the Black Sea, the present day Trabzon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study examines}} {{the experiences of}} four Latina/o pre-service teachers (PSTs) as they learn about teaching mathematics for understanding (TM 4 U) and integrating a child's out-of-school mathematical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> during instruction. Studying the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> of Latina/o PSTs is necessary because PSTs from minoritized backgrounds have particular insights about teaching diverse students that can inform the learning experiences of other PSTs. This study investigates the prior <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> beliefs about mathematics instruction the Latina/o PSTs (and those from minoritized backgrounds) bring as they begin their mathematics methods semester and how they leverage their experiences as they learn to teach mathematics to diverse students. Teaching mathematics for understanding is one way that teachers can support children's understanding of mathematics (Kilpatrick et al 2001). Teachers who integrate children's out-of-school mathematical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> in their practice draws upon multiple existing frameworks [...] the basic premise being that children come to school with mathematical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> that helps them learn mathematics in school (Gonzalez, Andrade, Civil, & Moll, 2001; Greer, Mukhopadhyay, Powell, & Nelson-Barber, 2009). My study looks at the experiences of Latina/o PSTs as they learn to help children leverage their out-of-school <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> to understand mathematics. Data sources included four individual interviews, relevant methods assignments and audio transcripts from methods course discussions, and observational notes from the PSTs' field experience classrooms. The study found that PSTs leveraged their prior experiences as English Language Learners to support linguistically diverse children learn mathematics. Based on their prior experiences, some of the PSTs were {{more sensitive to the}} needs of marginalized children learning mathematics. The study found that the PSTs leveraged their experiences as diverse learners to think about the ways teachers could connect in-school mathematics to children's out-of-school mathematical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences.</b> Yet the findings suggest that PSTs still need more experience articulating how exactly children's out-of-school experiences can help children understand mathematics. Implications of this study speak to how the beliefs <b>and</b> prior <b>experiences</b> of PSTs from minoritized backgrounds can inform how future teachers are prepared to teach mathematics to diverse students...|$|R

Age appropriate sexual interest, limited sexual <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiences,</b> <b>and</b> social deficits, may place adults with ASD at increased risk. Ninety-five adults with ASD and 117 adults without ASD completed question-naires regarding sexual knowledge sources, actual knowl-edge, perceived <b>knowledge,</b> <b>and</b> sexual victimization. Individuals with ASD obtained less of their sexual knowledge from social sources, more sexual knowledge from non-social sources, had less perceived <b>and</b> actual <b>knowledge,</b> <b>and</b> <b>experienced</b> more sexual victimization than controls. The increased risk of victimization by indi-viduals with ASD was partially mediated by their actual knowledge.
