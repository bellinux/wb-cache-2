2500|$|This area {{is related}} to {{corporate}} finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to business and market risk {{is a direct result}} of previous capital financial investments. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. [...] There is a fundamental debate [...] relating to [...] "Risk Management" [...] and shareholder value. Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about <b>firm-specific</b> risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure to pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost of bankruptcy in that market.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] {{represents}} {{the movement of}} the market modified by the stock's beta, while [...] {{represents the}} unsystematic risk of the security due to <b>firm-specific</b> factors.Macroeconomic events, such as changes in interest rates or the cost of labor, causes the systematic risk that affects the returns of all stocks, and the <b>firm-specific</b> events are the unexpected microeconomic events that affect the returns of specific firms, such as the death of key people or the lowering of the firm's credit rating, that would affect the firm, but would have a negligible effect on the economy. In a portfolio, the unsystematic risk due to <b>firm-specific</b> factors can be reduced to zero by diversification.|$|E

5000|$|The basic Japanese {{employment}} structure {{is known as}} [...] "Simultaneous recruiting of new graduates" [...] and [...] "ranking hierarchy", which includes seniority wages and lifetime employment. It allows employees to learn broad skills to achieve in long-term perspective through job rotation and on-the-job training {{which is likely to}} be <b>firm-specific.</b> Since Japanese firms develop <b>firm-specific</b> skills throughout long-term employment, it is difficult to enter the internal labor market which is only open to new graduates from high school or university, or those who can be competitive in the market with their special qualification or knowledge. This internal market worked well in Japanese firms.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some firms}} are more {{sensitive}} to these factors than others, and this <b>firm-specific</b> variance is typically denoted by its beta (β), which measures its variance compared to the market for one or more economic factors.|$|E
50|$|In macro-economics {{the term}} {{infrastructure}} usually refers to public infrastructure. That is, that which provides or supports state services. There is also <b>firm-specific</b> infrastructure such as factories, private roads, capital equipment, and other infrastructural capital assets under private ownership.|$|E
50|$|Recently much of Caballero's {{work has}} focused on {{international}} financial crises. He has also studied the aggregate behavior of economies with heterogeneous agents, the macroeconomic effects of irreversible investment in <b>firm-specific</b> assets, and Schumpeterian theories of technological progress through creative destruction.|$|E
5000|$|... the NYCEDC {{had a role}} {{in setting}} rates of {{business}} taxation, an alternative to the passing of tax legislation. Specifically, the Corporation was charged with negotiating <b>firm-specific</b> tax incentives with businesses as encouragement to either relocate to, or remain in, New York City.|$|E
50|$|<b>Firm-specific</b> advantages: Once {{domestic}} {{investment was}} exhausted, a firm could exploit its advantages linked to market imperfections, which {{could provide the}} firm with market power and competitive advantage. Further studies attempted to explain how firms could monetize these advantages {{in the form of}} licenses.|$|E
5000|$|So-called {{critical}} infrastructure includes some public and some <b>firm-specific</b> assets, for example, a private electric power utility would include assets such as transmission towers and transformers. For purposes of determining {{if they are}} [...] "critical", it is their function, not their ownership, that matters.|$|E
50|$|A {{financial}} system (within {{the scope of}} finance) {{is a system that}} allows the exchange of funds between lenders, investors, and borrowers. Financial systems operate at national, global, and <b>firm-specific</b> levels. They consist of complex, closely related services, markets, and institutions intended to provide an efficient and regular linkage between investors and depositors.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasing}} interest in how some businesses {{in an industry}} perform better than others {{led to the emergence}} of the ‘resource based view’ (RBV) of strategy (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991), which seeks to discover the <b>firm-specific</b> sources of superior performance - an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.|$|E
50|$|These {{equations}} {{show that}} the stock return {{is influenced by the}} market (beta), has a firm specific expected value (alpha) and <b>firm-specific</b> unexpected component (residual). Each stock's performance is in relation to the performance of a market index (such as the All Ordinaries). Security analysts often use the SIM for such functions as computing stock betas, evaluating stock selection skills, and conducting event studies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{insiders}} {{are those}} incumbent workers who enjoy more favorable employment opportunities than the outsiders. The {{reason for this}} disparity is that firms incur labor turnover costs when they replace insiders with outsiders. Examples of labor turnover costs are the costs of hiring, firing and providing <b>firm-specific</b> training. Insiders may resist competition with outsiders by refusing to cooperate with or harassing outsiders who try to underbid the wages of incumbent workers.|$|E

50|$|Peter Doeringer and Michael Piore 1971 {{established}} the dual labor market model. In this model, primary jobs {{are the ones}} with high <b>firm-specific</b> skills, high wages, good promotion opportunities and long-term attachment. On the contrary, secondary jobs are the ones with less skill requirement, lower wages, less promotion opportunities and higher labor turnover. The dual labor market model combined with the gender discrimination suggests that men dominate the primary jobs and that women are over-represented in the secondary jobs.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with the}} dynamic {{capability}} perspective, the composition process {{itself is a}} distinctive, <b>firm-specific,</b> and dynamic capability, that is, “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competence to address rapidly changing environments”. While the dynamic capability perspective assumes that executives need to engage in resource adaptation or renewal because the value of existing resources depreciates {{in the light of}} external changes, the CBV focuses on the competitive advantage that can be gained from combining existing resources in novel ways.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{internalization}} theory, {{the study}} of international business was largely focused on the environment, {{and in particular the}} economic, financial, political and cultural dimensions of doing business abroad. Internalization theory provided a theory of the international firm and thus augmented the international business field by demonstrating the interaction between the external environmental and the internal knowledge flows between MNE parent firm and subsidiaries. This interaction between external country-specific advantages (CSAs) and internal MNE <b>firm-specific</b> advantages (FSAs) is the nexus for strategic managerial international business decisions.|$|E
5000|$|Fusions of {{terminology}} are common. Sociological analysts {{refer to}} [...] "individual-level elements of social capital" [...] or [...] "an individual's social capital" [...] or just [...] "individual social capital" [...] while economic analysts often {{use the phrase}} <b>firm-specific</b> human capital. In either case the clearly includes individual capital but also some [...] "activity-", [...] "community-" [...] or [...] "firm-specific" [...] social capital (community trust) and instructional capital (shareable knowledge or skills). This is easy to measure: its yield is your salary in your current job.|$|E
5000|$|Marxist {{economics}} refers {{instead to}} [...] "an individual's social capital—individuals are sources neither {{of creativity and}} innovation, nor management skill. A problem with that analysis is that it simply cannot explain the substitution problem and lack of demand that occurs when, for instance, an understudy takes on a leading role, or a second author takes over writing a popular book series. At the very least {{there must be some}} conditional, if not <b>firm-specific</b> then [...] "class specific", special ability to command premiums for outstanding personal performance.|$|E
50|$|Routines {{are also}} the basis for change in that {{innovation}} refers to the new combinations of existing routines. In other words, the notion of routines is expanded beyond the simple procedures and programs. Added to this, it drew work from the capabilities perspective by introducing a <b>firm-specific,</b> path-dependent concept of routines that stresses on their complexity and underlies their influence on the differences in performance. Despite {{the fact that it}} is grounded in evolutionary economics and hence paying minimal focus on individual agency in routines, significant number of ideas remains aligned with the practice perspective.|$|E
50|$|To simplify analysis, the {{single-index model}} assumes {{that there is}} only 1 {{macroeconomic}} factor that causes the systematic risk affecting all stock returns and this factor can be represented by the rate of return on a market index, such as the S&P 500. According to this model, the return of any stock can be decomposed into the expected excess return of the individual stock due to <b>firm-specific</b> factors, commonly denoted by its alpha coefficient (α), the return due to macroeconomic events that affect the market, and the unexpected microeconomic events that affect only the firm.|$|E
5000|$|Knowledge {{services}} clusters - Like low-cost manufacturing clusters, these clusters {{have emerged}} typically in developing countries. They have {{been characterized by}} the availability of lower-cost skills and expertise serving a growing global demand for increasingly commoditized (i.e. standardized, less <b>firm-specific)</b> knowledge services, e.g. software development, engineering support, analytical services. Examples include Bangalore, India; Recife, Brazil; Shanghai, China. Multinational corporations have {{played an important role}} in [...] "customizing" [...] business conditions in these clusters. One example for this is the establishment of collaborative linkages with local universities to secure the supply of qualified, yet lower-cost engineers.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary sector}} and {{secondary}} sector both possess different wages, and each sector has different employment characteristics. The two markets are, however, connected with movement between them at specified ports of entry and exit. The {{jobs in the}} primary internal segment are those typical of the core of stable employees in a firm, need long on-the-job training in <b>firm-specific</b> skills, have security and good promotion prospects, a high span of discretion, and high material rewards.4 Professional and skilled craft work requiring occupation-specific rather than <b>firm-specific</b> skills, and often supplied on a contract or self-employed basis. The secondary external segment provides jobs that are low skilled, offer little autonomy and responsibility, low and unstable earnings, and poor working conditions, including casual and seasonal work. The secondary internal sector offers jobs that are generally low grade but with some on-the-job training, security, and promotion prospects. The concepts of primary and secondary labor-markets have now passed into conventional thought, with the primary labor-market commonly understood to mean people with secure jobs and good conditions of work in public-sector employment, the large corporations and highly unionized industries; while the secondary labor-market is understood to cover small employers, non-unionized sectors of the economy, competitive industries such as retailing, where jobs are less secure and conditions of work and pay generally poorest.|$|E
50|$|Blau et al. 2010 {{point out}} the harmful {{consequences}} of discrimination via feedback effects regardless of the initial cause of discrimination. The non-neoclassical insight that {{is not part of}} the statistical discrimination sheds light onto uncertainty. If a woman is given less <b>firm-specific</b> training and is assigned to lower-paid jobs where the cost of her resigning is low based on the general view of women, then this woman is more likely to quit her job, fulfilling the expectations, thus to reinforce group averages held by employers. However, if the employer invests a lot on her, the chance that she will stay is higher.|$|E
5000|$|With her {{co-author}} economist Margaret Blair, Stout {{has proposed}} a “team production” theory of the corporation that posits that corporate boards enjoy {{a broad range of}} discretion in setting corporate policy and allocating corporate surplus because they are {{in the best position to}} preserve and protect important <b>firm-specific</b> investments of not only shareholders, but also creditors, employees, and the larger community. Stout’s and Blair’s team production model was cited by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stevens in his dissenting opinion in Citizens United v. FEC. [...] This article is also among the most cited Corporate and Securities Law law review articles of all time.|$|E
