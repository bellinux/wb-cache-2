5000|$|Womack told The Mirror, [...] "This is {{the kind}} of stuff I grew up {{listening}} to. How true is this song? Even if you haven't been in that situation, we all know somebody who has. It's just honest." [...] In an interview with The Mirror Womack said, [...] "I was kind of languishing, not really sure what I wanted to do or what I needed to do. But then I heard I May Hate Myself in the Morning, and that was my answer. To put it in visual terms, it was like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> question mark over my head, and then all of the sudden, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> light bulb over my head. That song made me want {{to get back in the}} studio and make music again. I knew from the beginning that I wanted Hate Myself to be the first single.

Where shall I get--where shall I--? Don't tell her where I be!' And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman's mother busted into the milk-house. 'The villain--where is he?' says she. 'I'll claw his face for'n, let me only catch him!' Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a'most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid--or young woman rather--standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget it, never! 'Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn't find him nowhere at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the race, Johnson {{said that}} he [...] "just kept {{pressure}} on him (Keselowski). I {{could see that he}} was really tight and that was the first <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him that vulnerable all day. I just kept the pressure on him, kept searching for line. He saw me coming on the top and protected it. I just kept trying to put pressure on him hoping for a mistake.
