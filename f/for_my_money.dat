500|$|St Paul's {{became the}} place to go to hear the latest news of current affairs, war, religion, {{parliament}} and the court. In his play Englishmen <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>Money,</b> William Haughton (d. 1605) described Paul's walk as a kind of [...] "open house" [...] filled with a [...] "great store of company that do nothing but go up and down, and go up and down, and make a grumbling together".|$|E
500|$|When {{the episode}} was finally {{finished}} and aired, it was highly enjoyed by The X-Files cast and crew. Carter called the entry [...] "tight, funny, touching, and quirky." [...] Series writer Vince Gilligan {{was impressed with}} the episode, and noted that the episode represented the seventh season of the show as whole. He explained: [...] "The seventh season, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> was one of our best because we took more storytelling risks than in previous years." ...|$|E

You are right. Go in <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> <b>my</b> love. <b>Money's</b> the article. You'll make money of your good looks, and of the money Mrs Boffin and me will have the {{pleasure}} of settling upon you, and you'll live and die rich. That's the state to live and die in!' said Mr Boffin, in an unctuous manner. R--r--rich!' ...|$|R

500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{scientists}} have expressed similar sentiments. [...] Richard Dawkins, {{in a review}} of this book, said regarding the discussion of Lacan: [...] "We do not need the mathematical expertise of Sokal and Bricmont to assure us that the author of this stuff is a fake. Perhaps he is genuine when he speaks of non-scientific subjects? But a philosopher who is caught equating the erectile organ to the square root of minus one has, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> blown his credentials when it comes to things that I don't know anything about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrasting}} reviews, Film Threats Chris Gore {{said of the}} film, [...] " [...] delivers everything great foreign films should—action, sex, compelling characters, clever filmmaking, it's unpretentious (a {{requirement for}} me) {{and it has a}} story you can follow without having to read those annoying subtitles. I can't rave about this film enough—this is passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the best foreign films, heck, one of the best films I have seen", while Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader stated, [...] "About as entertaining as a no-brainer can be—a lot more fun, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> than a cornball theme-park ride like Speed, and every bit as fast moving. But don't expect much of an aftertaste." ...|$|E

One day I went to him, and told him what stock I had in London, desiring his assistance in getting it remitted; to which the good gentleman readily consented, but would only have me send <b>for</b> half <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> lest it should miscarry; which, if it did, I might still have the remainder to support me: and so taking letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble myself no farther about it.|$|R
2500|$|Cricket {{historian}} J Neville Turner said: [...] "Miller’s Luck is {{up there}} with the great cricket biographies. The sensitive areas are handled with integrity and discretion." [...] Ron Reed, leading Australian sports writer, in a syndicated piece for all News Corporation tabloids including the Melbourne Herald Sun wrote: ‘Miller’s Luck is an excellent biography. It’s an honest portrayal of the imperfect human being behind the heroic legend.’ AAP’s Jim Morton wrote: ‘Keith Miller is an enlightening biography of the test all-rounder, who was a cool and carefree match-winner on the field and a playboy philanderer off it.’ Jim Rosenthal in the UK Daily Mail ranked the book as the number one sports book of 2006. The UK Cricket Society named it as the cricket biography of the year and it was short-listed for the Cricket Writers’ book of the Year. Archie Mac on Cricket Web’s book review wrote: ‘This is Roland Perry’s eighth book on cricket, and <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> his best…the result is not just a great cricketing book, but also a complete portrait of a fascinating life.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes. But sorry for my misbehavior guys I reacted so fast because the fact I gave him a past [...] many times and every single time there was excuses.

6000|$|The light tone {{which he}} persisted in {{adopting}} stung Midwinter {{to the last}} pitch of exasperation. He came out again into the light, and stamped his foot angrily on the deck. [...] "Listen to me!" [...] he said. [...] "You don't know half the low things I have done in my lifetime. I have been a tradesman's drudge; I have swept out the shop and put up the shutters; I have carried parcels through the street, and waited <b>for</b> <b>my</b> master's <b>money</b> at his customers' doors." ...|$|R

5000|$|But {{what about}} those innumerable {{cases in which the}} possessive can hardly be said to {{correspond}} either to the subject or to the object of a verb? What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says eku paanga <b>for</b> [...] <b>my</b> <b>money</b> but hoku fale <b>for</b> <b>my</b> house?It may be stated as follows: the use of eku <b>for</b> <b>my</b> implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of hoku <b>for</b> <b>my</b> implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &c., towards me. Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word impress, we may say, perhaps, that eku is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while hoku is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} I had had {{now with}} {{a great many people}} for receiving such large sums and selling jewels of such considerable value gave me opportunity to know and converse with several of the best merchants of the place, so that I wanted no direction now how to get <b>my</b> <b>money</b> remitted to England. Applying, therefore, to several merchants, that I might neither risk it all on the credit of one merchant, nor suffer any single man to know the quantity of money I had; I say, applying myself to several merchants, I got bills of exchange payable in London <b>for</b> all <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> The first bills I took with me; the second bills I left in trust (in case of any disaster at sea) {{in the hands of the}} first merchant, him to whom I was recommended by my friend from Paris.|$|R

Faith, I was fool enough to put my name to a bit of paper for him, and as they could not catch him in Mayo, they laid hold of me at Kingstown here. And there was a pretty to do. Didn't Mrs. Gam say I was ruining her family, that's all?
