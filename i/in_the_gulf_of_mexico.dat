The depression soon made landfall on the peninsula and weakened before reemerging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> on July4.

5|$|Hurricane Cindy was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> since 1960. The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> on 16September. The disturbance swiftly intensified to hurricane strength, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. Despite favorable conditions, with high sea surface temperatures, the storm only intensified into a Category1 hurricane. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), it made landfall at High Island {{on the morning of}} 17September as a slightly weaker system with an atmospheric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20September.|$|E

This is confirmed by results from the first comprehensive surveys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire area carried out during 1994 - 1996.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea is {{a region}} of {{strategic}} importance and {{a major source of}} essential commodities for both domestic and industrial use, while its sea lanes connect trade from multiple continents. The maritime profile of the region also presents enormous opportunities for enhancing socio-economic development of member States and for delivering positive human development index across the region. However, there are increasing maritime security threats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea that affect the peaceful uses of sea, impair the exploitation of coastal resources and also undermine regional and global security. Effective responses to these threats require a comprehensive approach, one which is based on regional and international cooperation. This thesis examines the prospects and challenges of maritime security cooperation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea. It analyses the concept of maritime security cooperation and develops a framework for explaining maritime security threats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea. <b>The</b> thesis examines the responses to maritime security threats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea by assessing the effectiveness of regional and international cooperative initiatives. The conclusion of the thesis is that current processes of maritime security cooperation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea are inadequate and suffers multiple limitations. Appropriate responses must therefore be put in place to address the gaps. The thesis provides several suggestions for enhancing maritime security cooperation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea...|$|R

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{carrying}} capacity of two Mediterranean areas, the Incze et al. model and its modification were applied. Our measures were carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta (Central MED), where mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) are intensively cultivated (production of approximately 200 t per year) and <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Castellammare (Southern MED), where bivalve culture is not widely practised. Velocities of water current and in field filtration rates were measured in each area. Total suspended matter (TSM), suspended chlorophyll-a (CHLa), lipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> particulate were measured seasonally and used as tools to evaluate the trophic status of the two areas. The two areas differed strongly in current velocities (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Castellammare were higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta); vice versa, cholorophyll-a concentration was higher in Gaeta and calculated average clearance rates were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta (2. 2 ± 1. 2 l h− 1; and in Castellammare, 3. 2 ± 1. 2 l h− 1). With these values measured <b>in</b> field, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta, <b>the</b> average potential mollusc biomass that can be cultivated using the original Incze et al. model was 403 t, while the same value using the modified model was 160 t in Castellammare average potential mollusc biomass; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original model, it was 2034 t and about 200 t calculated with the modified model. Our results lead us to hypothesise that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Castellammare both <b>the</b> hydrodynamics and the total gross available food may not represent limiting factors {{for the expansion of}} bivalve culture. Although the quantity of available food is lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta, <b>the</b> higher current velocities compensate for the lower quantity of TSM and the overall outcome is that in Castellammare it would potentially be possible to obtain greater biomass than <b>in</b> Gaeta. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta, if TSM does not represent a limiting factor, the low current velocities measured seasonally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area may represent the real limiting factor for bivalve culture. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Gaeta, we believe that the existing trophic and hydrodynamic conditions do not permit further development of bivalve cultivation and that the maximum carrying capacity of this area may already have been achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{importance}} of pre- and post-settlement processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temperate reef fish Tautogolabrus adspersus at multiple spatial scales and in 2 distinct regions, Newfoundland, Canada, and <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine, USA. We examined a total of 20 sites (separated by 100 to 1000 m) nested within 10 locations (separated by ca 10 km). Greater numbers of adult fish were observed in Newfoundland than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine; however, higher abundances of newly recruited fish occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine. An experiment in which we provided standardized habitats in both regions also revealed that recruitment was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine than Newfoundland. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine, variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> densities of adults and newly recruited fish was most pronounced among sites, but in Newfoundland we detected pronounced variability at both the site and location scales. Algal height was not associated with among-site variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abundances of recruits or adults. Algal coverage, however, was an important predictor of variability <b>of</b> fish abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine but not <b>in</b> Newfoundland. <b>The</b> age structure of Newfoundland populations suggests that strong recruitment years are rare, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine <b>the</b> age structure is consistent with the expectation of declining abundance with age. Our data suggest that pre-settlement processes are not of primary importance to cunner populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine. Rather, we hypothesize that habitat-related differences in post-settlement processes are the most significant factors affecting these populations. However, <b>in</b> Newfoundland <b>the</b> evidence gathered thus far supports the hypothesis that episodic settlement is responsible for much of <b>the</b> variation <b>in</b> population size in this region...|$|R
