If a body of water is labelled as a sea, then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the granting of access permits to foreign vessels.

The products of isothermal reaction were scales of a-Al 2 O 3 plus {{small amounts of}} Cr 2 O 3. These grew according to parabolic kinetics, interrupted by episodic weight losses caused by partial spallation. No nitridation occurred during the isothermal exposures. Reaction during thermal cycling for up to 260 one hour cycles was much more severe. Repeated scale spallation led to subsurface alloy depletion in aluminium and, to a lesser extent, chromium. This caused transformation of the prior alloy three-phase structures (a-Cr+b-NiAl+g-Ni) to single-phase g-nickel solution. Destruction of the external scale allowed <b>gas</b> <b>access</b> to this metal which was able to dissolve both oxygen and nitrogen. Inward diffusion of the two oxidants led to development of a complex internal precipitation zone: Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 beneath the surface, then Al 2 O 3 then AIN, then AIN + Cr 2 N and finally AIN alone in the deepest region.

Ex situ Raman mapping of the surfaces showed clear variations in the rate of carbon formation across the surface of polarized anodes. Computational simulations describing the geometry of the cell showed that this is due to variations in <b>gas</b> <b>access.</b> These results demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy in combination with traditional characterization tools, to provide detailed understanding of critical processes occurring within functional SOFCs.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the field study of the subsidence following the implementation of one of the road building methods. The field study was performed in the area alongside oil and <b>gas</b> field <b>access</b> roads built in the loose marshy ground (peat). The paper provides a description of the geosynthetics installation technology. Outdated road building technologies designated for weak road base conditions feature high consumption of materials and energy and substantial anthropogenic impact on the environment. These technologies comprise complete or partial replacement of the ground by sand, road metal, or macrofragmental material combined with timber as the reinforcing element of the base (a plank road). The objective of the field study was to develop an ecologically safe technology capable of reducing the anthropogenic impact on the environment and improving the strength and the operating safety of the road structure. The field study has proven that the aforementioned objective may be attained through the application of geosynthetic materials designated for the improvement of the bearing capacity of the weak road base. Geosynthetic materials and structures of the road subgrade ensure high speed of construction, high quality and reliability of the road structure, reduction in the consumption of materials and energy to assure the ecological safety of construction of oil and <b>gas</b> field <b>access</b> roads.

Furthermore we have demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of O 2 arises due to interaction of O 2 with the active site. Using protein film infrared electrochemistry (PFIRE) under H 2 oxidation conditions, in conjunction with solution infrared measurements, we have identified previously unreported oxidized inactive and catalytically active reduced states of the RH active site.

Based {{on the number}} and identity of metal atoms in their active sites, hydrogenases fall into three main classes, [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-. All contain the unusual ligand CO (and in most cases CN- as well) making them intriguing examples of 'organometallic' cofactors. These ligands render the active sites superbly 'visible' using infrared spectroscopy, which complements the use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in studying mechanisms and identifying intermediates. Hydrogenases are becoming a focus of attention for research into future energy technologies, not only H 2 production but also H 2 oxidation in fuel cells. Hydrogenases immobilized on electrodes exhibit high electrocatalytic activity, providing not only an important new technique for their investigation, but also a basis for novel fuel cells either using the enzyme itself, or inspired synthetic catalysts. Favourable comparisons have been made with platinum electrocatalysts, an advantage of enzymes being their specificity for H 2 and tolerance of CO.

40|$|International audienceThermal {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} tool to determine the solid-gas reactions kinetics. Several methods have been proposed to interpret experimental data. Nevertheless these methods must be used with low sample quantity (typically few milligrams of solid) to interpret for example thermogravimetric data. However some powders are structured in aggregates which involve that, even with low sample quantity, the <b>gas</b> <b>access</b> to the solid phase may be limited due to the gas diffusion inside the intra-aggregates porosity. Several models {{have been developed to}} account for this complexity based on the grain model or the pore model approaches. However most of these models are based on the Sohn's law of additive reaction times which is submitted to restrictive conditions: kinetic order with respect to the reaction gas equal to one, and shrinking-core type kinetic models. We propose here another approach offering more diversity in the applications. In the case of CaO carbonation by CO 2, thermogravimetric data present some particularities showing a complex behaviour. Indeed a strong slowing down of the reaction is observed on thermogravimetric curves. Moreover these curves exhibit a sigmoid shape and an induction period which can be as long as 20 minutes. In order to explain the kinetic slowing down, changes in texture and microstructure during processing were regarded as essential. Reaction at the grain scale induces a volume increase from CaO to CaCO 3 which modifies the porosity characteristics, thus limiting the <b>gas</b> <b>access</b> inside the aggregates. So carbonation reaction must be described by coupling the kinetics of the solid-gas reaction at the grains scale ("micro-scale") and the heat and mass transfers at the aggregate scale ("meso-scale"). The kinetic modeling was realized thanks to CIN 4 software which is able to couple both micro- and meso-scales. Induction period is linked to the nuclei formation mechanism. The presence of large induction periods indicates that the nucleation process can be sluggish depending on experimental conditions. This observation can be correlated with an ab initio study of the calcite nucleation at the CaO surface which has shown that some surfaces appear unfavorable for nucleation due to strong structural instabilities related with CO 2 insertion. So at the micro-scale, the kinetic model was based on the assumption of one nucleus by dense grain with isotropic growth. At meso-scale, we considered spherical aggregates with pores of the same size which depends on the fractionnal conversion. Exchanges of heat and mass are governed by diffusion equations of heat and the gaseous species. By finite difference it was possible to calculate the reaction rate for given T and P CO 2. This rate allows to evaluate heat and mass sources produced by the reaction. Microscopic reaction thus influences the spatial and temporal evolution of the thermodynamic processes at the aggregate scales. Inversely since it modifies the kinetic constants, thermodynamic influences fractional conversion and reaction rate of the microscopic reaction. Using this approach, it was thus possible to reproduce the experimental data from the induction period up to the kinetic slowing down...|$|E

The HupUV protein exhibits typical features of [NiFe] hydrogenases but, interestingly, is resistant to inactivation by O 2. Understanding the O 2 resistance of HupUV will help {{in the design of}} hydrogenases with high potential for biotechnological applications. To test whether this property results from O 2 inaccessibility to the active site, we introduced two mutations in order to enlarge the <b>gas</b> <b>access</b> channel in the HupUV protein.

Also, in contrast with the wild-type protein, the mutated protein exhibited an increase in hydrogenase activity after reductive activation in the presence of reduced methyl viologen (up to 30 % of the activity of the wild-type). The H 2 -sensing HupUV protein is the first component of the H 2 -transduction cascade, which, together with the two-component system HupT/HupR, regulates HupSL synthesis in response to H 2 availability. In vitro, the purified mutant HupUV protein was able to interact with the histidine kinase HupT.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{increase}} the performance of the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at 1, 000 C by decreasing the polarization resistance from 0. 2 {Omega}-cm{sup 2 } at 300 mA/cm{sup 2 }. Decreased polarization resistance will allow operation at higher current densities. This work is in support of the Westinghouse tubular SOFC technology using YSZ electrolyte and strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode. As a result of work performed last year at Argonne National Laboratory and information derived from the literature, the limitations at the cathode/electrolyte interface can be classified into two main areas. First, the ionic conductivity of the LSM cathode material is low which limits the reaction zone to an area very close to the interface, {{while the rest of the}} cathode thickness acts essentially as current collector with channels for <b>gas</b> <b>access.</b> Second, the electronic conductivity in YSZ is very low which limits the reaction zone to areas that are the boundaries between LSM and YSZ rather than the YSZ surface away from LSM at the interface.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of two stage serial turbochargers {{in combination with}} internal combustion engines can improve the overall efficiency of powertrain systems. In conjunction {{with the increase of}} engine volumetric efficiency, two stage boosting technologies are capable of increasing torque and pedal response of small displacement engines. In two stage serial turbocharges, a high pressure (HP) and a low pressure (LP) turbocharger are connected by a series of ducts. The former can increase charge pressure for low air mass flow typical of low engine speed. The latter has a bigger size and can cooperate with higher mass flows. In serial configuration, turbochargers are packaged {{in a way that the}} exhaust <b>gases</b> <b>access</b> the LP turbine after exiting the HP turbine. On the induction side, fresh air is compressed sequentially by LP and HP compressors. By-pass valves and waste-gated turbines are often included in two stage boosting systems in order to regulate turbochargers operations. One-dimensional modelling approaches are considered for investigating the integration of boosting systems with internal combustion engines. In this scenario, turbocharger behaviour are input in the powertrain models through previously measured compressor and turbine maps in turbocharger gas stands. However, this procedure does not capture all the effects that occur on engine application such as heat transfer, friction and flow motion that influence the turbochargers operations. This is of particular importance for two stage serial turbochargers where the LP compressor may induce a swirling motion to the flow at the entry of the HP compressor. In addition, flow non-uniformities caused by bends between the two compressors can make the HP compressor perform differently. In this paper, a review of the available literature containing approaches to quantify the effects of heat transfer on turbocharger efficiency and the flow influence in the prediction of two stage serial turbochargers performance is explored...|$|R

Most of the microbial hydrogenase enzymes {{are very sensitive}} to oxygen (O 2) and are irreversibly inhibited by it. A subclass of enzyme however, is O 2 -tolerant and retains its activity in the presence of oxygen. For some time it was thought that a particular narrow <b>gas</b> <b>access</b> channel to the active site was the reason for this tolerance or that modifications of the active site itself made the enzyme O 2 -tolerant. EXAFS investigations showed that the active site structures were identical between O 2 -sensitive and tolerant hydrogenases [1]. From a bioinformatics analysis, alterations {{in the vicinity of the}} proximal FeS cluster were suggested [2]. The FeS-cluster displayed coordination by two additional cysteine amino acid residues. By mutational experiments these additional cysteines were shown to alter the redox behaviour of the proximal FeS cluster and be responsible for the O 2 -tolerance [2]. Later, the crystal structure of the hydrogenase revealed a new type of FeS-cluster, a [4 Fe- 3 S](6 Cys) cluster with an unusual coordination geometry [3]. The electronic structure of this proximal FeS-cluster allowed an additional redox transition and protects the active site at 11 Å distance from oxidative damage. References 1 J. Fritsch, S.

The most widespread gaseous fuel – natural gas – has the low production cost. It is 2 - 3 times cheaper than liquid fuel production and 6 - 12 times cheaper than coal production. When natural gas is transported to distances from 1. 5 to 2. 5 thousand km by the pipeline, its cost with account of transportation is 1. 5 - 2 times less than the cost of coal and the fuel storage facilities are not needed. Plants powered by natural gas have the higher efficiency as compared to the plants operating on other types of fuel. They are easier and cheaper to maintain and are relatively simple in automation, thus enhancing safety and improving the production process flow, do not require complicated fuel feeding or ash handling systems.

Among the most promising ones, the freeze-casting also called Ice-Templating allows the fabrication of ceramic parts exhibiting high porosity (> 50 %) and vertically aligned and hierarchically organized pores. Such structures were firstly conceived for biomedical applications like bone substitute and tissue engineering, but the distinctive features of freeze-cast structures have attracted the attention of diverse scientific fields, especially in high temperature ceramic-based energy production systems. Indeed, technologies like (a) Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Electrolyser Cell (SOEC), (b) gas separation (O 2, H 2) by asymmetric supported membranes based on mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIEC) or hydrogen-permeable metals, and (c) Catalytic Membrane Reactor (CMR) systems present a porous component in their physical structure.

Finally, a review of the state of the art freeze-cast based energy applications developed up to now and expected to be promising is given to illustrate the large perspectives opened by the implementation of the freeze-casting of ceramics for energy fields. Here we suggest discussing about the feasibility of incorporate freeze-cast porous support in high temperature ceramic-based energy applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{streaking}} measurement of water-window attosecond pulses generated via high harmonic generation, driven by sub- 2 -cycle, CEP-stable, 1850 nm laser pulses. Both the central photon energy and the energy bandwidth far exceed what has been demonstrated thus far, warranting {{the investigation of the}} attosecond streaking technique for the soft X-ray regime and the limits of the FROGCRAB retrieval algorithm under such conditions. We also discuss the problem of attochirp compensation and issues regarding much lower photo-ionization cross sections compared with the XUV in addition to the fact that several shells of target <b>gases</b> are <b>accessed</b> simultaneously. Based on our investigation, we caution that the vastly different conditions in the soft X-ray regime warrant a diligent examination of the fidelity of the measurement and the retrieval procedure.

50|$|A L Thomas {{established}} his Dour Iron Foundry, which {{over the years}} grew to become Dover Engineering Works, then Elkington Gatic and finally, Gatic. The company continues to produce iron <b>gas</b> and airtight <b>access</b> covers to this day, supplying across Britain and to international markets from a reduced premises in Holmestone Road. If one looks carefully there are still drain covers around marked by the manufacturer, A L Thomas and Sons, and many more that now bare the current and recent names Elkington Gatic, and Gatic.|$|R
50|$|The Pakistani {{portion of}} the {{pipeline}} is to be constructed by the state-owned China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau. It will be 42 inches in diameter, and {{have the capacity to}} transport 1 billion cubic feet of liquified natural gas every day, with an additional 500 million cubic feet of additional capacity when the planned off-shore LNG terminal is also completed The project will not only provide <b>gas</b> exporters with <b>access</b> to the Pakistani market, but will also allow China to secure a route for its own imports.|$|R
