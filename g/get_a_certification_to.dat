A learner’s behavior such as if a learner will drop out from the course can be predicted. How to provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests such as surrogate exam-taker is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a grade predicting method that uses student activity features to predict whether <b>a</b> learner may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>certification</b> if he/she takes a test. The method consists of two-step classifications: motivation classification (MC) and grade classification (GC). The MC divides all learners into three groups including certification earning, video watching, and course sampling. The GC then predicts <b>a</b> <b>certification</b> earning learner {{may or may not}} obtain <b>a</b> <b>certification.</b> Our experiment shows that the proposed method can fit the classification model at a fine scale and it is possible to find a surrogate exam-taker...|$|R
