40|$|Gouge {{dehorning}} {{was evaluated}} as {{a mode of}} transmitting bovine leukemia virus in Holstein calves at a commercial dairy. Significantly (p less than 0. 05) more calves dehorned by the gouge method developed antibodies to bovine leukemia virus, as measured by agar-gel immunodiffusion, three months after dehorning, than calves not dehorned. The field use of a blood-contaminated <b>dehorning</b> <b>device</b> resulted in transmission of bovine leukemia virus...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} if ketoprofen, {{in addition to}} local anaesthesia, reduces pain following dehorning, we experimentally dehorned dairy calves, less than 2 weeks of age, with (20 calves) or without (20 calves) intramuscular injections of ketoprofen. All calves received a local anesthetic (lidocaine) prior to dehorning and were dehorned with heat cauterization. Cortisol concentration was measured via jugular blood samples taken immediately before dehorning and at 3 and 6 hours following dehorning. Calf behavior was recorded between 0 and 2, 3 and 5, and 6 and 8 hours following dehorning. There was no significant (P > 0. 10) effect on creep feed consumption, cortisol concentration, {{or any of the}} behavioral measures during the time periods studied. However, the difference in cortisol concentrations from the time of dehorning until 3 hours later was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the ketoprofen-treated group. These results suggest that ketoprofen, in addition to local anesthesia, may alleviate short-term pain following dehorning with a butane <b>dehorning</b> <b>device</b> in dairy calves less than 2 weeks of age...|$|E
