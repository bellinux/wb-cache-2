5|$|At nearly 87 years old, Wheelwright died of {{apoplexy}} on 15 November 1679 and {{was buried}} at the East Village Graveyard, where no marker <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> {{for the next}} 200 years. The graveyard became the Colonial Burying Ground of Salisbury, and memorials have since been installed recognizing Wheelwright's historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In June 8, 1989, two plaques {{commemorating the}} 150th {{anniversary of the}} laying of the {{cornerstone}} at Kawaiahaʻo Church were erected underneath an 1889 slab that honored the life of missionary Hiram Bingham I on the centennial of his birth. The plaque on the left briefly gives credit to Kapeau's copper plate which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> under the cornerstone in 1839.|$|E

5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} {{was within}} the village of Ardekul in South Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan. The village is isolated between mountains and hills. Although the Iranian government had distributed more than 800 seismographs throughout the country, few <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> in the Qayen region due to its desert climate and the remoteness of the area.|$|E
5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and visor buried together some 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} ban that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> on Wagner in Germany {{after he}} had fled Dresden was fully lifted in 1862. The composer settled in Biebrich, on the Rhine near Wiesbaden in Hesse. Here Minna visited him for the last time: they parted irrevocably, though Wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in Dresden until her death in 1866.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center.

5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} you one thing, he can hit a fastball; {{and if he}} sits on a breaking ball, he can hit that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> on the bereavement list {{following the death of}} his father-in-law.

5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many lunar {{orbiting}} satellites, scientists came to discover that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable.

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing it back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> in reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.|$|E
5|$|Search {{teams were}} sent {{from the lower}} floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor {{and ran out of}} air in their {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> on the roof by a helicopter. Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1822 as Peziza fulgens, {{and has been}} grouped in several different genera since its original description. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data shows that within the Pezizales order, Caloscypha fulgens belongs in an evolutionary lineage with the families Helvellaceae, Morchellaceae, and Tuberaceae. Since 1968, Caloscypha <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> in the Pyronemataceae family, a small grouping of fungi distinguished from other Pezizales by their relatively undeveloped peridium. In 2002, the new family Caloscyphaceae was described to contain the monotypic genus Caloscypha.|$|E
5|$|To {{solve these}} {{problems}} Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had the younger co-emperor John IV blinded, which resulted in much resentment. To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus III, ordering him to lift an excommunication that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> against him by the former Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos and {{to submit to the}} authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
