The characteristic property of these matrices with ideal entries involves a generalization of idempotency and tran-sitivity. As a consequence, the order {{structure of the}} segment of the subring lattice of the full matrix ring Mn(R) which is above the ring Dn(R) of diagonal matrices, depends only on the ordered monoid structure of all ideals of R.

Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements.

50|$|The {{quenching}} process {{produces a}} high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface {{layer of the}} bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using {{the heat from the}} bar's core. Steel billets 130mm² ("pencil ingots") are heated to approximately 1200°C to 1250°C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last rolling stand, the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the cooling bed.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the design}} stage, in 1929, the navy {{requested}} an alteration to the fins. It was considered desirable {{for the bottom}} of the lower fin to be visible from the control car. Charles E. Rosendahl had witnessed the Graf Zeppelin almost snagging her fin on power lines during her heavy take off from Lakehurst to start her round-the-world flight earlier that year. The design change would also allow direct vision between the main control car and the emergency control position in the lower fin. The control car was moved 8 ft aft and all the fins were shortened and deepened. The leading edge root of the fins no longer coincided with a main (deep) ring and instead the foremost attachment was now to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ring</b> at frame 28.75. This achieved the required visibility, improved low-speed controllability, due to the increased span of the control surfaces, and simplified stress calculations, by reducing the number of fin attachment points. The designers and the navys inspectors, led by the very experienced Charles P Burgess, were entirely satisfied with the revised stress calculations.

The main roads of Bangalore coming into the city include Bellary Road in the north, Tumkur Road and Mysore Road in the west, Kanakpura Road, Bannerghatta Road and Hosur Road {{in the south and}} Airport Road and Old Madras Road in the east. Many of Bangalore's erstwhile colonial and town streets were developed into commercial and entertainment areas after independence. The B.V.K Iyengar Road became the retail hub of Bangalore, while MG Road, Commercial Street and Brigade Road became important shopping, recreation and corporate areas. Consequently, traffic increased exponentially, especially on MG Road, which forms the main artery for the city's east-west traffic. But for MG Road, other roads in and around the erstwhile Parade Ground remain narrow, winding roads. Bangalore's vehicular traffic has increased manifold, with 1.6 million registered vehicles in the city - the second highest for an Indian city, after New Delhi. [...] The maintenance and construction of roads to address the growing traffic in the city has been a challenge to the BDA and the BMP. Development of the city road infrastructure has revolved around imposing one-way traffic in certain areas, improving traffic flow in junctions, constructing ring roads, bridges, floyers and other grade separators. Six high volume junctions were identified for improvements, through a public-private partnership involving corporate sponsors and various state government agencies, such as the Siddapur Road and Hosur Road junction, sponsored by Infosys and the Airport Road and <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Ring</b> Road junction sponsored by the TATAs.
