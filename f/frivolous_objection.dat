2500|$|However, {{any attempt}} to recuse a judge from hearing a case on the ground of a {{conflict}} of interest must be based on credible grounds, and must not be motivated by any extraneous purpose.

2500|$|Imputed bias {{was also}} {{referred}} to in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), which involved {{the issue of whether}} the President exercises the power of clemency in his personal discretion or whether he is required to act upon the Cabinet's advice. The appellant argued that Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, {{who was a member of}} the Court of Appeal hearing the matter, ought to be automatically disqualified. According to the appellant, this was because the Chief Justice had previously been the Attorney-General, and as such, must have advised the President on the scope of his discretion. The implication of the appellant's submission was that the Chief Justice would have to decide the case against the appellant to cover up any negligence in his advice to the President. The Court endorsed the principle of judicial disqualification in the case of a personal interest, stating that [...] "where a judge is personally interested in the outcome of the case before him, he will not be able to give an impartial and objective judgment on the case. If he were to be allowed to adjudicate on the case notwithstanding this risk, that would, without more, undermine public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice." [...] It went on to reject the applicant's argument based on the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Locabail that a judge [...] "would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or <b>frivolous</b> <b>objection</b> as he would to ignore an objection of substance". In the Court's view, the disqualification application was frivolous and appeared to be motivated to diminish the judicial process such that a fresh hearing had to be convened. In addition, the central premise of the application– that the President could have acted in his own discretion in exercising the clemency power– was implausible.|$|E

5000|$|Trivial {{objections}} (also {{referred to}} as hair-splitting, nothing but objections, barrage of objections and banal objections) is an informal logical fallacy where irrelevant and sometimes <b>frivolous</b> <b>objections</b> are made to divert the {{attention away from the}} topic that is being discussed. This type of argument is called a [...] "quibble" [...] or [...] "quillet". Trivial objections are a special case of red herring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's {{talking of}} taking it off me, {{as you call}} it?" [...] stormed Sally. [...] "Can't you forget your burglarious career for a second? This isn't {{the same thing as}} going about {{stealing}} defenceless girls' photographs. This is business. I think you would make an enormous success of a dog-place, and you admit you're good, so why make <b>frivolous</b> <b>objections?</b> Why shouldn't I put money into a good thing? Don't you want me to get rich, or what is it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The final {{was fixed}} for the {{following}} Thursday morning. Gossett, who was a broker, had made some <b>frivolous</b> <b>objection</b> about the difficulty of absenting himself from Wall Street, but had been overruled. When Sigsbee pointed out that he could easily defeat Archibald {{and get to the}} city by lunch-time if he wished, and that in any case his partner would be looking after things, he allowed himself to be persuaded, though reluctantly. It was a well-known fact that Gossett {{was in the midst of}} some rather sizeable deals at that time.|$|E
60|$|She liked at {{any rate}} this idea of his being by {{character}} and in fact a mover of men--liked it much better than some other points in his nature and aspect. She cared nothing for his cotton-mill--the Goodwood patent left her imagination absolutely cold. She wished him no ounce less of his manhood, but she sometimes {{thought he would be}} rather nicer if he looked, for instance, a little differently. His jaw was too square and set and his figure too straight and stiff: these things suggested a want of easy consonance with the deeper rhythms of life. Then she viewed with reserve a habit he had of dressing always in the same manner; it was not apparently that he wore the same clothes continually, for, on the contrary, his garments had a way of looking rather too new. But they all seemed of the same piece; the figure, the stuff, was so drearily usual. She had reminded herself more than once that this was a <b>frivolous</b> <b>objection</b> to a person of his importance; and then she had amended the rebuke by saying {{that it would be a}} <b>frivolous</b> <b>objection</b> only if she were in love with him. She was not in love with him and therefore might criticise his small defects as well as his great--which latter consisted in the collective reproach of his being too serious, or, rather, not of his being so, since one could never be, but certainly of his seeming so. He showed his appetites and designs too simply and artlessly; when one was alone with him he talked too much about the same subject, and when other people were present he talked too little about anything. And yet he was of supremely strong, clean make--which was so much she saw the different fitted parts of him as she had seen, in museums and portraits, the different fitted parts of armoured warriors--in plates of steel handsomely inlaid with gold. It was very strange: where, ever, was any tangible link between her impression and her act? Caspar Goodwood had never corresponded to her idea of a delightful person, and she supposed that this was why he left her so harshly critical. When, however, Lord Warburton, who not only did correspond with it, but gave an extension to the term, appealed to her approval, she found herself still unsatisfied. It was certainly strange.|$|E

40|$|For many years, {{courts and}} {{commentators}} {{have been concerned}} about a phenomenon in class action litigation referred to as objector "blackmail. " The term "blackmail" is used figuratively rather than literally; so-called objector "blackmail" is simply a specific application of the general concern with legal regimes that permit one or more individuals to "hold out" and disrupt collective action. The holdout problem in class action litigation stems from the following series of events: When a class action is settled, class members who {{do not like the}} proposed settlement are permitted to file objections with the federal district court that must approve it. If the district court nonetheless approves the settlement, the class members who filed objections have the right to appeal the district court's approval. If objectors appeal the settlement, however, the final resolution of the settlement will be delayed during the time it takes the court of appeals to decide the appeal, which can be years. Not only does the appeal delay final resolution of the settlement, but, more importantly for the blackmail problem, it also delays the point at which class counsel can receive their fee awards, which are contingent upon the settlement. As class counsel are eager to receive these fees, they are willing to pay objectors out of their own pockets to drop the appeals. This, it is thought, has led class members to file wholly <b>frivolous</b> <b>objections</b> and appeals {{for no other reason than}} to induce these side payments from class counsel. These appeals are what courts and commentators refer to as objector "blackmail. ...|$|R
2500|$|The objectors {{asked the}} Presbytery [...] "to find that Mr Meek was unworthy of the {{character}} of a minister, therefore to depose or lay him aside from preaching; at least, to find that he cannot be settled in Cambuslang, etc., etc." [...] Many of the ministers in the Presbytery knew Meek and his work, so it dismissed these objections, and even threatened the objectors. They declared some of the <b>objections</b> <b>frivolous</b> and unworthy of notice, others absurd and unintelligible; and all of them irrelevant, and that not a single habile (that is, competent) witness was offered for the proof of them.|$|R
5000|$|Contesting a will can be expensive. According to a Boston-area estate {{planning}} attorney quoted in Consumer Reports (March, 2012), [...] "A typical will contest will cost $10,000 to $50,000, and that's a conservative estimate". Costs can increase even more if a will contest actually goes to trial, {{and the overall}} value of an estate can determine if a will contest is worth the expense. In some cases, {{the threat of a}} will contest is intended to both pressure the estate into avoiding the expense of a trial and forcing an out-of-court settlement more favorable to disgruntled heirs. However, those who make <b>frivolous</b> or groundless <b>objections</b> to a will may be forced to pay the costs for both sides in the court battle.|$|R
