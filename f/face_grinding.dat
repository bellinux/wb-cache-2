5000|$|The {{specially}} designed new starter areas met a mixed reception from critics. On the one hand, they were felt {{to give a}} strong new perspective to existing players or a solid introduction to the game to new players. The arrangement of quests and content in these areas was felt to be more finely tuned than for existing races, with players unlikely to <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> in order to progress and an interesting backstory being gradually revealed. It was felt that Blizzard had learned from {{the release of the}} original game, with the new content being varied without becoming overwhelming to new players, and new concepts being gradually introduced. On the other hand, reviewers felt that the new starter areas were poorly integrated with the existing world, leaving them feeling [...] "tacked on." [...] They were also disappointed that the new areas had a definite finish, beyond which a player would have to switch back to older content in order to progress their character. This progression didn't feel as smooth to reviewers when compared to the movement between zones for new characters from the older starting areas. The experience was also felt to be short-lived, with players being able to progress through these new areas with a couple of days' play without any new introductory dungeons to explore. It was also felt that these changes didn't address existing problems, such as the travel time between quest locations.|$|E

To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the sliding face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height.

It guarantees that on the machined surface there will be no areas unaffected by the wheel. In case of through grinding the obtained theoretical dependences help to determine the processing conditions, taking into account the allowable values of form deviation of flat surface.

This paper proposes innovative face-grinding kinematics in order to improve the surface properties for {{tool grinding}}.

In this paper a new patterning method will be introduced by using a fly-cutting kinematic for the structuring process. In <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> experiments the patterned grinding wheels showed great potential to enhance the overall grinding performance by significantly decreasing process forces and grinding burn.
