40|$|Transition of the {{precision}} engineering and instrumentation to {{the widespread use}} of nanoscale structures and thin layers requires improved localization methods for measuring the depth of the material. Unified standards and the generally accepted methods for measuring the wear resistance and friction coefficient are not currently available. The aim of this work was the development of a universal friction machine with the simplified requirements for the preparation and the geometric shape of the sample and the opposing disc. An important requirement for the equipment and the method of measurement is the ability to measure the friction coefficient and the determination of the wear resistance of coatings and hardened layers of micron and submicron thicknesses. Another important requirement is modeling in the experiment of acyclic friction process, {{as close as possible to}} the real operating conditions of components and parts. Both of these conditions are successfully realized by using the method of «disc on plate». Implementation of «disk on plate» method was used to simplify and improve the rapid measurement, and to minimize load on the <b>friction</b> <b>assembly,</b> reduce friction pair temperature, increase the sensitivity and improve the resistive bridge thermal stabilization. The complex for the study of friction and wear processes of various materials pairs in conditions close to operational was manufactured and tested.

This paper shows a method of modeling the transition process during gear shifting in planetary gear trains. The simulation model is developed with in order to provide virtual research of planetary gear trains, which would positively decrease the number of real prototypes, thus considerably saving time and contributing to the quality improvement of the final product (planetary gear train) and vehicles in general. Introduction Modeling of gear shift processes has been carried out on the planetary gear type Ravigneaux used in planetary gear trains of motor vehicles. The model was developed modularly, so that more simulation models can be added to the whole. At the same time each subsystem is a model for itself and can be used independently from the main model. Simplified engine model Bearing in mind that, for the simulation of the planetary gear which {{is the subject of this}} paper, the necessary input parameters are in the form of engine torque Mm, angular velocity and motor ωm moment of inertia of rotating engine components reduced to the input shaft gear, a simplified model of an internal combustion engine has been formed. Model of external load External load resistance is in the form of the torque Mt occurring on the drive wheel of the vehicle. On the other hand, this load is defined by the moment of inertia of rotating elements from the planetary gear to the drive wheel, reduced to the output shaft. Model of friction transmission simulation Transmission power control in planetary gears is achieved through friction components. The output size of this subsystem is the moment of carrying the <b>friction</b> <b>assembly.</b> Simulation model of the planetary gear train The model simulation of the planetary gear type Ravigneaux was formed in accordance with the kinematic scheme of the gear train. The gears are presented as a solid body defined by mass, moment of inertia, position with respect to the system and the center of gravity. Subsystem for monitoring the simulation results Measuring and recording the simulation results are simulated with the simulation tracking subsystem. The simulation results are described through the torque and the angular velocity as a function of time. Analysis of the simulation model Forming a simulation model enables virtual testing of the planetary gear and the analysis of the impact of certain parameters on the behavior of the gear during gear changes. In other words, an opportunity has been created to examine the behavior of the model while simulating different conditions. Conclusion This paper presents the modeling of the gear change process in a planetary gear using computers in the Matlab / Simulink environment. Computer-aided modeling of the gear change process enables the generation of different versions of virtual gear models with relevant data about their characteristics thus helping designers in their decision making in the iterative process of design, i. e. in making appropriate decisions in the early stages of design...|$|E

40|$|This Final Technical Report {{discusses}} the {{progress was made}} on the experimental and numerical tasks over the duration of this project regarding a new technique for decreasing engine friction and wear via liner rotation. The experimental subtasks involved quantifying the reduction in engine friction for a prototype rotating liner engine relative to a comparable baseline engine. Both engine were single cylinder conversions of nominally identical production four-cylinder engines. Hot motoring tests were conducted initially and revealed that liner rotation decreased engine friction by 20 % under motoring conditions. A well-established model was used to estimate that liner rotation should decrease the friction of a four-cylinder engine by 40 % under hot motoring conditions. Hot motoring tear-down tests revealed that the crankshaft and valve train frictional losses were essentially {{the same for the}} two engines, as expected. However, the rotating liner engine had much lower (> 70 %) piston <b>assembly</b> <b>friction</b> compared to the conventional engine. Finally, we used the Instantaneous IMEP method to compare the crank-angle resolved piston <b>assembly</b> <b>friction</b> for the two engines. Under hot motoring conditions, these measurements revealed a significant reduction in piston <b>assembly</b> <b>friction,</b> especially in the vicinity of compression TDC when the lubrication regime transitions from hydrodynamic through mixed and into boundary friction. We have some remaining problems with these measurements that we expect to solve during the next few weeks. We will then perform these measurements under firing conditions. We also proposed to improve the state-of-the-art of numerical modeling of piston <b>assembly</b> <b>friction</b> for conventional engines and then to extend this model to rotating liner engines. Our research team first modeled a single ring in the Purdue ring-liner test rig. Our model showed good agreement with the test rig data for a range of speeds and loads. We then modeled a complete piston assembly in an engine. The model appears to produce the correct behavior, but we cannot quantify its strengths or weaknesses until our crank-angle-resolved measurements have been completed. Finally, we proposed and implemented a model for the effects of liner rotation on piston <b>assembly</b> <b>friction.</b> Here, we propose that the rotating liner design is analogous to the shaft-bushing mechanism. Therefore, we used the side-slip rolling friction model to simulate the effects of liner rotation.

KEYWORDS: discrete event control, force control, <b>assembly,</b> <b>friction</b> INTRODUCTION Position errors {{have been shown to}} be the primary cause of failure in robotic assembly [10]. Instead, force control is a natural paradigm for assembly tasks as it is fundamentally compliant, virtually eliminating any dependence on position. A discrete [...] ...|$|R

In the present work, the authors recalled some results on the riveting process and the strength of one kind of riveted joints obtained by simulation and experimental investigations in a previous paper. The numerical results were in very good agreement with the experimental results, allowing us to validate our simulation approach and its use for further studies. We selected several engineering parameters for the riveted joint: initial <b>assembly,</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient, rivet's geometry and sheets' geometry, in order to carry out a parametric study and determine their relative importance. These were conducted in FEA software. The results showed the impact on riveting process and the strength of the riveted joint by varying each parameter which was interesting for the industry...|$|R

Based on the above, we obtained solutions/findings for frictional torque/force, load which comparatively experiential & theoretical and lost dynamic characteristics of precision gear assemblies. Most of the research was carried out for damping, squeeze oil film thickness and sliding velocity so the present work is centered on the above said measurement techniques for analyzing the dynamic performance of gear pump...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDry {{friction}} between hair fibers {{plays a major}} role in the collective hair dynamic behavior as it accounts for typical nonsmooth features such as stick-slip instabilities. However, due the challenges posed by the modeling of nonsmooth friction, previous mechanical models for hair either neglect friction or use an approximate smooth friction model, thus losing important visual features. In this paper we present a new generic robust solver for capturing Coulomb <b>friction</b> in large <b>assemblies</b> of tightly packed fibers such as hair. Our method is based on an iterative algorithm where each single contact problem is efficiently and robustly solved by introducing a hybrid strategy that combines a new zero-finding formulation of (exact) Coulomb friction together with an analytical solver as a fail-safe. Our global solver turns out to be very robust and highly scalable as it can handle up to a few thousand densely packed fibers subject to tens of thousands frictional contacts at a reasonable computational cost. It can be conveniently combined to any fiber model with various rest shapes, from smooth to curly. Our results, visually validated against real hair motions, depict typical hair collective effects and greatly enhance the realism of standard hair simulators...|$|R
40|$|Granular chain {{packings}} {{exhibit a}} striking emergent strain-stiffening behavior despite the individual looseness of the constitutive chains. Using indentation experiments on such assemblies, we measure an exponential {{increase in the}} collective resistance force F with the indentation depth z, and with the square root of the number N of beads per chain. These two observations are respectively reminiscent of the self-amplification of friction in a capstan or in interleaved books, {{as well as the}} physics of polymers. The experimental data are well captured by a novel model based on these two ingredients. Specifically, the resistance force is found to vary according to the universal relation: F ∼μ√(N) Φ^ 11 / 8 z/ b, where μ is the friction coefficient between two elementary beads, b is their size, and Φ is the volume fraction of chain beads when semi-diluted in a surrounding medium of unconnected beads. Our study suggests that theories normally confined to the realm of polymer physics at a molecular level can be used to explain phenomena at a macroscopic level. This class of systems enables the study of <b>friction</b> in complex <b>assemblies,</b> with practical implications for the design of new materials, the textile industry, and biology...|$|R
