5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant</b> on new land.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} methods for determining the reliability of block schemes of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{at the design stage}} was carried out. The features of reliability evaluation of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> block schemes were considered in terms of functioning of the electricity market. Objective: to increase the operational reliability of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> block schemes and to reduce the probability of electricity undersupply. Technique of realization: the implementation of modern algorithms and programs for evaluation of the reliability of block schemes. Results: The main methods of analysis of the reliability of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> block schemes were analyzed, numerical values of integral reliability index were obtained according to the number of failures in the circuit. Conclusions: It was shown that the Markov processes method applied for the analysis of reliability of the block schemes of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> is advantageous both at the design stage and in operation or reconstruction. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ?????? ???????????????? ????? ????????????? ???????. ???? ????????????: ????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???????. ???????? ??????????: ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ????. ?????????? ????????????: ???????????????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ???????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????. ??????: ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ??? ?? ????? ??????????????, ??? ? ? ???????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????...|$|R

2500|$|Central station {{electricity}} {{can often}} be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine/generator. While the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly {{the same in the}} nominal regime, diesel motors decrease in efficiency in non-nominal regimes at low power [...] while if an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> needs to generate less power it will shut down its least efficient generators, thereby increasing efficiency. The electric train can save energy (as compared to diesel) by regenerative braking and by not needing to consume energy by idling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coasting. However, electric rolling stock may run cooling blowers when stopped or coasting, thus consuming energy.|$|E
2500|$|Method claim 1 of {{the patent}} {{application}} claims a three-step method for a broker to hedge risks for purchaser-users of an input {{of a product}} or service (termed a commodity). For example, an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> might be a purchaser and user of coal, which it purchases from coal-mining companies (producer-sellers) and uses to make electricity. The power plant might seek to insulate itself from upward changes {{in the price of}} coal by engaging in [...] "hedging" [...] transactions. The risk can be quantified in terms of dollars (termed a [...] "risk position"). Thus, if the purchaser-user uses 1000 tons of coal in a given period, and the potential price spike is $10 per ton, the purchaser-user's total risk position for that period is 1000 × $10, or $10,000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{community}} was originally known as [...] "Laurel Factory" [...] when Edward Snowden {{became the first}} postmaster in 1837 and was a true company town, with a school and shops, {{and many of the}} mill workers' homes owned until the 1860s by the company. [...] During the 1840s, three historic churches in the community—the Methodist Est. 1842, St. Mary of the Mills (Roman Catholic) Est. 1845, and St. Philip's (Episcopal) Est. 1839 —established what are still vigorous congregations. [...] During the Civil War, Laurel Factory, like much of Maryland, was a divided community, but with many Southern sympathizers. [...] Union soldiers patrolled the railroad, and for a time there was also a Union hospital. [...] During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, while it still operated its factories, manufacturing played a less important role in the community. [...] Laurel evolved into an early suburban town. [...] Many of its residents commuted by rail to jobs in Washington or Baltimore. The town was incorporated in 1870 and reincorporated in 1890 to coincide with a new <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> and paved streets and boarded sidewalks.

2500|$|Professor of History Stephen Rabe {{writes that}} [...] "scholars have understandably focused on…the Bay of Pigs invasion, the US {{campaign}} {{of terrorism and}} sabotage known as Operation Mongoose, the assassination plots against Fidel Castro, and, of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis. Less {{attention has been given}} to the state of US-Cuban relations {{in the aftermath of the}} missile crisis." [...] Rabe writes that reports from the Church Committee reveal that from June 1963 onward, the Kennedy administration intensified its war against Cuba while the CIA integrated propaganda, [...] "economic denial", and sabotage to attack the Cuban state as well as specific targets within. One example cited is an incident where CIA agents, seeking to assassinate Castro, provided a Cuban official, Rolando Cubela Secades, with a ballpoint pen rigged with a poisonous hypodermic needle. At this time, the CIA received authorization for 13 major operations in Cuba, including attacks on an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> an oil refinery, and a sugar mill. Rabe has argued that the [...] "Kennedy administration... showed no interest in Castro's repeated request that the United States cease its campaign of sabotage and terrorism against Cuba. Kennedy did not pursue a dual-track policy toward Cuba.... The United States would entertain only proposals of surrender." [...] Rabe further documents how [...] "Exile groups, such as Alpha 66 and the Second Front of Escambray, staged hit-and-run raids on the island... on ships transporting goods…purchased arms in the United States and launched...attacks from the Bahamas." ...|$|E
60|$|Arriving there, the {{visitors}} were astonished at {{the extent of}} the plant so recently established in this practically unknown district. The great mill, where the wood pulp was made, was a building constructed from pine slabs and cobblestones, material gathered from the clearing in which it stood, but it was quite substantial and roomy. Adjoining the mill was the factory building where the pulp was rolled into print paper. Surrounding these huge buildings were some sixty small dwellings of the bungalow type, {{for the use of the}} workmen, built of rough boards, but neat and uniform in appearance. Almost in the center of this group stood the extensive storehouse from which all necessary supplies were furnished the mill hands, the cost being deducted from their wages. The <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was a building at the edge of Royal Waterfall, the low and persistent roar of which was scarcely drowned by the rumble of machinery. Finally, at the edge of the clearing nearest the mills, stood the business office, and to this place Mr. Merrick and Arthur at once proceeded.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{there is}} nothing {{scientific}} about our currency and finance at all. It is a thing that has grown up and elaborated itself out of very simple beginnings {{in the course of}} a century or so. Three hundred years ago the edifice had hardly begun to rise from the ground, most property was real, most people lived directly on the land, most business was on a cash basis, oversea trade was a proportionately small affair, labour was locally fixed. Most of the world was at the level at which much of China remains to-day--able to get along without even coinage. It was a rudimentary world from the point of view of the modern financier and industrial organiser. Well, on that rude, secure basis there has now been piled the most chancy and insecurely experimental system of conventions and assumptions about money and credit it is possible to imagine. There has grown up a vast system of lending and borrowing, a world-wide extension of joint-stock enterprises that involve at last the most fantastic relationships. I find myself, for example, owning (partially, at least) a bank in New Zealand, a railway in Cuba, another in Canada, several in Brazil, an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in the City of Westminster, and so on, and I use these stocks and shares as a sort of interest-bearing money. If I want money to spend, I sell a railway share much as one might change a hundred-pound banknote; if I have more cash than I need immediately I buy a few shares. I perceive that the value of these shares oscillates, sometimes rather gravely, and that the value of the alleged money on the cheques I get also oscillates as compared with the things I want to buy; that, indeed, the whole system (which has only existed for a couple of centuries or so, and which keeps on getting higher and giddier) is perpetually swaying and quivering and bending and sagging; but it is only when such a great crisis occurs as that of 1907 that it enters my mind that possibly there is no limit to these oscillations, that possibly the whole vast accidental edifice will presently come smashing down.|$|E
