25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal for them to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>some</b> adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally {{are the ones who}} tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, Frank {{was once}} again pivotal to many {{explosive}} storylines including accidentally killing Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) with his car, his marriage to Peggy, and a battle {{to regain control of}} The Queen Vic from Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). However, in early 2000, Reid began to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>some</b> poor health. After suffering with nervous exhaustion, which he attributed to EastEnders grueling filming schedule, Reid was forced to take an unplanned break from the show. Penned scripts and plots had to be completely rewritten to account for his absence, including the departure of Sid Owen who played Reid's on-screen son Ricky. The storyline initially planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's absence Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode; resulting in a slightly less plausible plotline. Upon Reid's return further problems arose, allegedly regarding the producers decision not to allow him to attend a charity function that was being held in his honour. Reid allegedly quit in protest, although the BBC have since denied this. Reid was persuaded by producer John Yorke to remain in the role for a further six months in order to facilitate one further explosive storyline. Frank resumed his relationship with old flame Pat whilst still married to Peggy, but was famously caught out and shamed by his fuming wife in front of a packed pub on Guy Fawkes Night 2000, although Pat had decided against running away with Frank at the last minute. After receiving a hefty slap, Frank left once again, leaving his wife in serious debt, just as he had done to Pat years earlier.|$|E

500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{sessions and}} programming {{took place at}} Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio. Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes she’d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made right then and there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she had to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>some</b> personal things {{to come to the}} point where she'd let somebody write for her in the manner that we did. It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is so personal. That was a big thing." ...|$|E

He revealed that their relationship would not run smoothly, and observed that once couples start dating, [...] "Everything goes to hell." [...] Colfer suggested that Kurt returning to McKinley may cause difficulties in their relationship, but noted [...] "Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? That’s what they tell me. So {{even if they do}} <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>some</b> bumps in the road, it would be very realistic." [...] In a Q with Billboard on the day [...] "Born This Way" [...] ran with Kurt's McKinley return, Criss stated that Blaine and Kurt were [...] "in the honeymoon stages" [...] of their relationship, and would still be [...] "at the end of the [...] season".|$|E

Ritz likened Jackson's transformation to Marvin Gaye as he stated, [...] " [...] just as Gaye moved from What's Going On to Let's Get It On, from the austere to the ecstatic, Janet, every bit as serious-minded as Marvin, moved from Rhythm Nation to Janet, her statement of sexual liberation".|$|E

Otherwise you're just going to hope to pick up 10 or 11 votes." [...] Similarly, Nathan Moore agreed that the song was not strong enough, but said [...] "It was a great idea to get Bonnie involved, there's a lot of love for Bonnie out there." [...] Mick Dalley (of Yahoo!

British journalist Dave Goodman acknowledged that Tyler's entry was an improvement on the previous year, though argued that {{it was a combination of}} a poor position in the running order and the song that kept the UK from scoring higher.|$|E
