5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. <b>Elements</b> <b>that</b> can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|A {{band-pass filter}} can be {{constructed}} using any <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> can resonate. Filters using stubs can clearly be made band-pass; numerous other structures are possible and some are presented below.|$|E
5|$|Although both {{hydrogen}} and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves similarly to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.|$|E
50|$|Equivalently, one may define an atom {{to be an}} <b>element</b> <b>that</b> {{is minimal}} among the non-zero elements, or {{alternatively}} an <b>element</b> <b>that</b> covers the least element 0.|$|R

In one embodiment, a capacitor that incorporates a conductive <b>element</b> <b>that</b> conforms to the shape of an array of elongated bodies includes: a first conductive <b>element</b> <b>that</b> conforms to the shape of an array of elongated bodies; a second conductive <b>element</b> <b>that</b> conforms to the shape of an array of elongated bodies; and a dielectric material disposed in between the first conductive element and the second conductive element, and thereby physically separates them...|$|R

In romantic relationships, there is the intimacy <b>element</b> <b>that</b> is added. This is physical intimacy and a deeper emotional intimacy than a friendship would have. There are four relationship stages {{when it comes to}} romantic relationships: ...|$|R
5|$|Although most Final Fantasy {{installments}} are stand-alone {{stories with}} different settings and main characters, they feature identical <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> define the franchise. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names, and game mechanics. Plots center {{on a group}} of heroes battling a great evil while exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.|$|E
5|$|An mRNA {{may contain}} {{regulatory}} elements itself, such as riboswitches, in the 5' untranslated region or 3' untranslated region; these cis-regulatory elements regulate {{the activity of}} that mRNA. The untranslated regions can also contain <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> regulate other genes.|$|E
5|$|Deep Space Nine stands {{apart from}} earlier Trek series for its lengthy {{serialized}} storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themes—all <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade {{in the original}} series and The Next Generation. Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of DS9, making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry.|$|E

40|$|A {{time delay}} {{estimation}} based general framework {{for trajectory tracking}} control of robot manipulators is presented. The controller consists of three elements: a time&# 8208;delay&# 8208;estimation <b>element</b> <b>that</b> cancels continuous nonlinearities of robot dynamics, an injecting <b>element</b> <b>that</b> endows desired error dynamics, and a correcting <b>element</b> <b>that</b> suppresses residual time delay estimation error caused by discontinuous nonlinearities. Terminal sliding mode {{is used for the}} correcting element to pursue fast convergence of the time delay estimation error. Implementation of proposed control is easy because calculation of robot dynamics including friction is not required. Experimental results verify high&# 8208;accuracy trajectory tracking of industrial robot manipulators...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its time}} of development, Arena is {{in certain areas}} a {{relatively}} modern browser; because it functioned as a testbed, it saw the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream, e.g. CSS. Arena implemented many elements of the HTML3 and HTML3.2 specification including math <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> were deprecated in HTML4, HTML tables, and experimental style sheets.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on {{agriculture}} in his Nongzheng Quanshu, the agronomist Xu Guangqi (1562–1633) {{took an interest}} in irrigation, fertilizers, famine relief, economic and textile crops, and empirical observation of the <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> gave insight into early understandings of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} this style {{incorporates}} <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> are clearly {{from a different}} period. All {{but one of the}} Fatimid minarets were destroyed by an earthquake in 1303, and later rebuilt by the Mamluks, but replicas of these minarets are used in Neo-Fatimid mosques.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an allegorical mural was {{painted on the}} façade of her Warsaw birthplace. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> she would {{discover}} as an adult: polonium and radium. Also in 2011, a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula was named in her honor.|$|E
5|$|Promethium (formerly prometheum) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; {{it is one}} of only two such <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium. Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the work of}} Hergé {{can be traced back to}} the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Hergé Foundation and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The story {{contains}} {{a number of}} <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> Hergé had already utilized in earlier comics The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel out West (1931) and The Adventures of Tom and Millie (1933). He prevented its republication during the German occupation of Belgium, and it was colourised and republished in 1948 in Tintin magazine. Casterman first published it in a collected album in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Xenon is {{a member}} of the zero-valence <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> are called noble or inert gases. It is inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.|$|E
5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique <b>elements</b> <b>that</b> set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
