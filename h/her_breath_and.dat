25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water. Her body became light {{as if she had}} been floating. Lyra held <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> fell deeper into that strange dream. Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E
60|$|Virginia drew in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} the Colonel in amazement.|$|E
60|$|I {{gave her}} a look that made <b>her</b> catch <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> I was just {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} shudder into herself a moment. <b>Her</b> <b>breath</b> came <b>and</b> went quickly.|$|R

60|$|Rosamund caught <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{clutched}} Sakr-el-Bahr's arm, the {{arm that}} held the lantern.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Green caught <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{sitting down}} again took {{his arm in}} her {{trembling}} fingers.|$|E
60|$|She caught <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> set a hand {{upon her}} bosom {{as if to}} repress its sudden tumult.|$|E
60|$|She {{put herself}} before him {{with one hand}} pressed upon <b>her</b> bosom, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> weak <b>and</b> fluttering.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} hers were empty of any recognition. Then they lit up. She caught <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> quickly, <b>and</b> a faint flush {{came into her}} face.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kybird stopped and, with a half-turn, play-fully {{reached for}} {{him with her}} umbrella. The {{exertion}} and the joke combined took the remnant of <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> away, <b>and</b> she stood still, panting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you making}} fun, or {{is all this}} meant, Mr. Seymour?" [...] asked Benita, still {{speaking}} beneath <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> looking straight before her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] murmured Ursula, under <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> without {{attempting}} to move, for {{she felt as}} if her knees would give way under her.|$|E
60|$|Not so Juanita. Her {{black eyes}} snapped {{suddenly}} with suspicion, she drew in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> closed her little mouth firmly. Then she began a crescendo.|$|E
60|$|A great {{struggle}} {{must have}} been raging within her. Even through the gloom His Eminence could see her shoulders and breast working convulsively, whilst <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> came <b>and</b> went in quick, feverish gasps.|$|R
60|$|The man was Eliphalet Hopper. He {{got down}} from the sill with a motion at once sheepish <b>and</b> stealthy. <b>Her</b> <b>breath</b> caught, <b>and</b> instinctively she gave back toward the door, as if to open it again.|$|R
60|$|Noting {{that the}} {{scramble}} had tired her, {{he began to}} rub his ax with a sharpening stone, and Carrie mused while she got <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> By <b>and</b> by {{she looked up and}} saw his twinkling glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's his name?' said Cytherea flatly. <b>Her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{heart had}} begun their old tricks, and {{came and went}} hotly. Miss Hinton could not see her face.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped with}} a quick catch in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> the {{darkness}} round them seemed to become luminous with the light of hope that broke upon him within.|$|E
60|$|A {{light was}} burning there, {{and showed her}} Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty, fast asleep. Edith held <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> felt herself drawn on towards her.|$|E
60|$|The poet espied, pursued and overtook the infant. He {{observed}} that apparently she drew <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> lightly <b>and</b> felt <b>her</b> life in every limb, and that presumably her acquaintance with death {{was of the}} most superficial character.|$|R
6000|$|... "One o' the lightermen let go o' {{the skipper}} and went arter 'er, and, just as I was giving {{the other three}} a helping 'and, 'e came back with 'er. Mrs. Pratt caught <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> as for the skipper, 'e didn't know where to look, as the saying is. I just saw the lady give 'im one quick look, and then afore I could dream of wot was coming, she rushes {{up to me and}} flings 'er long, bony arms round my neck.|$|R
6000|$|She had no {{companion}} of mortal race, But <b>her</b> tremulous <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> flushing face Told, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes, [...] 15 That her dreams were less slumber than Paradise: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, only..." [...] Saxon caught <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{avoided the}} {{threatened}} outburst. [...] "Only I'm not hungry. It's been so hot all day. It was terrible in the laundry." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Old Woman of Berkeley {{laid her}} down [...] And her eyes grew deadly dim, [...] Short came <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> the {{struggle}} of death [...] Did loosen every limb.|$|E
60|$|She did not move, {{save the}} convulsive motion of <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> the nervous action of her fingers. She {{stared down at}} {{a spot in the}} carpet; she couldn't face him.|$|E
60|$|She {{attempted}} {{one last}} cry to him, but <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> failed <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> {{she dropped her}} pace to a panting walk.|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the narrow pathway along the perilous incline. Somehow, with this tall, {{beautiful}} creature beside him, it looked more perilous than before. She may have thought so too, for she drew in <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> sharply <b>and</b> sank down again.|$|R
6000|$|Polly {{held on to}} {{the back}} of Tom's chair, for a minute, for the news took <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> away, <b>and</b> she felt as if the world was coming to an end, [...] "failed" [...] was such a vaguely dreadful word to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "To edit it?" [...] His wife caught <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{she took}} {{a little time to}} realize the fact, while she stared hard at her husband {{to make sure he was}} not joking.|$|E
60|$|She bent towards him; {{her sweet}} lips touched his brow; the perfume from <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> hair beat upon him; {{the light of}} her wondrous eyes searched out his very soul, reading the answer that was written there.|$|E
60|$|He {{could hardly}} see Patsy at all, the Major wrapped her {{in such an}} ample embrace; but bye and bye she escaped to get <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> then her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles.|$|E
50|$|Adam: Tessa's {{boyfriend and}} {{neighbour}} who {{spends most of}} his time attending to his mother, who after the death of his father became depressed. Adam is there when Tessa takes <b>her</b> last <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> is the love of her short life.|$|R
60|$|Now {{she was a}} woman transformed. She seemed {{taller and}} stronger. Her girlishness, too, had vanished. Her cheeks burned, her eyes glowed, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> came <b>and</b> went rapidly through her quivering nostrils. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen looked down on her niece with naive admiration.|$|R
60|$|But {{the poor}} doctor did look troubled, and had cause to do so, for just then Rose tried {{to laugh at}} Dolly {{charging}} {{into the room with}} a warming-pan, but could not, for the sharp pain took <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> away <b>and</b> made <b>her</b> cry out.|$|R
