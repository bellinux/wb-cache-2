5|$|The Lives formed {{part of the}} Cabinet of Biography in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Within the set of ten, the three-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal (1835–37) and the two-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France (1838–39) {{consist of}} biographies of {{important}} writers and thinkers of the 14th to 18th centuries. Most of them were written by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Shelley's biographies reveal her as a professional woman of letters, contracted to produce several volumes of works and paid well to do so. Her extensive <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in these works.|$|E

25|$|If his {{teaching}} {{on the church}} was less widely followed, {{it was because of}} doubts as to the thoroughness of his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and as to his freedom from bias as a critic. Some hundreds of clergymen influenced by the Oxford Movement made submission to the Holy See; but a larger number, who also came under its influence, did not accept that belief in the church necessitated acceptance of the Pope.|$|E
25|$|Ľudovít Štúr {{was born}} on 29 October 1815 in Uhrovec, in the Austrian Empire (in the same house where Alexander Dubček was later born) as the second child of Samuel and Anna Štúr. He was baptized in the Evangelical Lutheran church in Uhrovec. He {{acquired}} his basic education, including the study of Latin, from his father Samuel, who was a teacher. From 1827–1829, he studied in Győr where he attended a lower grammar school. There, he improved his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> and the German Greek and Hungarian languages. These studies inspired his admiration of Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Ján Kollár and Jiří Dobrovsky. In 1829, he decided to change schools.|$|E
25|$|Admission to NaUKMA {{is open to}} both Ukrainian and {{international}} applicants. Admission is granted based on entrance examination scores. Entrance exams are administered as multiple choice tests covering several subjects including Ukrainian, English, law, mathematics, history of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, humanities (literature or history) and natural science, with the tests being machine scored. The admissions procedure was introduced in order to stem alleged corruption in the admission process. Admission tests are considered challenging and cover {{a broader range of}} subjects than the typical entrance examinations held at the majority of other universities in Ukraine. Testing the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy is exceptional among Ukrainian universities. It was introduced because {{of the role of the}} university in Ukrainian history. The university also has a Department of Preuniversity Training, which organizes test preparation courses for prospective students as well as trial testing sessions.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{approaches}} towards study of, and commentary on, the Tanakh. In the Jewish community, the classical approach is religious study of the Bible, where {{it is assumed that}} the Bible is divinely inspired. Another approach is to study the Bible as a human creation. In this approach, Biblical studies can be considered as a sub-field of religious studies. The later practice, when applied to the Torah, is considered heresy by the Orthodox Jewish community. As such, much modern day Bible commentary written by non-Orthodox authors is considered forbidden by rabbis teaching in Orthodox yeshivas. Some classical rabbinic commentators, such as Abraham Ibn Ezra, Gersonides, and Maimonides, used many elements of contemporary biblical criticism, including their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> science, and philology. Their use of historical and scientific analysis of the Bible was considered acceptable by historic Judaism due to the author's faith commitment to the idea that God revealed the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.|$|E

In particular, the novel argues that <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> is power, particularly as it is written in books. The title can refer {{to any of the}} major characters, including Dracula. As Nancy Baker explains in The Globe and Mail, the novel is [...] "about the love of books" [...] and the knowledge and comfort they offer the characters– even Dracula himself is a bibliophile. As one critic explains, the novel is specifically about the love of scholarship. At the heart of the novel is an exploration of [...] "the power and price of scholarly obsession".

Indeed, he {{has proven to}} be a very cultured man on many occasions, having a wide <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> literature, and art. He often offers quotes from a variety of literary sources, including Shakespeare and Keats. Later in this , he reveals himself to be a baseball fan. Sara notes that this is typical of Grissom, saying that he would like [...] "all those stats". However, Grissom is not too familiar with popular culture. In [...] "Two and a Half Deaths", Jim Brass was talking about a TV program which he thought had already [...] "jumped the shark," [...] but Grissom did not know the term. While trying to explain, Brass says, [...] "Remember the Fonz?", which Grissom did not know either.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months after}} the end of the war, Queen Mary's {{youngest}} son, John, died at the age of thirteen. She described her shock and sorrow in her diary and letters, extracts of which were published after her death: [...] "our poor darling little Johnnie had passed away suddenly... The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind & sympathetic & this has helped us [...] much." [...] Her staunch support of her husband continued during the latter half of his reign. She advised him on speeches and used her extensive <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and royalty to advise him on matters affecting his position. He appreciated her discretion, intelligence, and judgement. She maintained an air of self-assured calm throughout all her public engagements in the years after the war, a period marked by civil unrest over social conditions, Irish independence, and Indian nationalism.|$|E
500|$|After two years, Crane left Pennington for Claverack College, a quasi-military school. He later {{looked back}} on his time at Claverack as [...] "the happiest period of my life {{although}} I {{was not aware of}} it." [...] A classmate remembered him as a highly literate but erratic student, lucky to pass examinations in math and science, and yet [...] "far in advance of his fellow students in his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> and Literature", his favorite subjects. While he held an impressive record on the drill field and baseball diamond, Crane generally did not excel in the classroom. Not having a middle name, as was customary among other students, he took to signing his name [...] "Stephen T. Crane" [...] in order [...] "to win recognition as a regular fellow". Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious. He sometimes skipped class in order to play baseball, a game in which he starred as catcher. He was also greatly interested in the school's military training program. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion. One classmate described him as [...] "indeed physically attractive without being handsome", but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular at Claverack. [...] Although academically weak, Crane gained experience at Claverack that provided background (and likely some anecdotes from the Civil War veterans on the staff) that proved useful when he came to write The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

2500|$|Although showing {{talent for}} his studies, Gramsci had {{financial}} problems and poor health.

Although Gramsci later used this phrase to escape the prison censors, his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life.|$|E

Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, could be instructive on related measures in the present— how to do things better or worse.

Carr researched the science and literature of the time period and noted, [...] "The biggest challenge was to study the psychological literature of that day so that none of my characters would not know more than they could have known in terms of psychology.
