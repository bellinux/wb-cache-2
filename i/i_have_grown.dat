500|$|Unlike EastEnders, E20 uses {{incidental}} music, which Scott Matthewman of The Stage said {{makes it}} feel like an episode of Hollyoaks, a Channel 4 soap opera targeted at a teen audience. A remix of the EastEnders theme tune was created for the series, {{with members of the}} public submitting remixes in a competition held on the BBC website. The competition opened on 11 November 2009 and was officially launched on 13 November by Annie Mac on her BBC Radio 1 show. More than 250 entries were submitted. They were reduced to four and judged by Sathe, Santer, Keillor, original theme tune composer Simon May, and BBC Radio 1Xtra's DJ Ace. The winner, 21-year-old Carl Darling, was announced on 4 December 2009. He said [...] "I was very excited to hear that my track was chosen by such an eclectic judging panel. And to spend time in the BBC studios and walking around the Square was phenomenal. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up hearing Simon May's original theme tune and watching Albert Square and the iconic Queen Vic, so I feel very privileged {{to be a part of}} EastEnders: E20 history!" [...] Darling explained that he wanted to keep all the [...] "essential features" [...] of the original theme, but to make a grimy drum and bass version.|$|E
2500|$|Gates {{approved}} the address in advance. Alexander Hamilton also urged {{the army to}} take action against Congress. A second address appeared on the 12th that tried to co-opt Washington into the conspiracy. Washington moved quickly to quell the impending mutiny by calling an officers' meeting on 15 March. He also notified Congress that it needed to act soon on the army's grievances. At the officers' meeting Washington appealed to his audience not to carry out, [...] "any measures which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained." [...] At the end of his speech he took out a letter to read. Unable to read it, he took out his spectacles and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you must pardon me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> gray in your service and now find myself growing blind". Some of his officers were reduced to tears. In a unanimous vote, the officers expressed confidence in Congress and repudiated the Newburgh Addresses. On 22 March Congress voted to adopt the compensation plan which the officers then accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Gillian Chung was {{the first}} starlet to make a public appearance. After a New Year celebration with fans on 11 February, she {{delivered}} a brief statement to the press in which she apologised for the hurt caused to those around her.(English translation: [...] "...This incident has {{caused a lot of}} turmoil and harm to me and people around me. I admit that I was so naive and silly in the past, but now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up. I thank my company, my family and my friends for their blessing and support. This incident has caused a lot of [...] effects to the society which I deeply regret. In the future, I will continue to work hard, and face my life positively." [...] Emperor sought closure by stating that neither it nor any of its artists would be making any further statement about the incident. The press conference drew mixed response from the media and the public. An Apple Daily commentary was particularly scathing about the hypocrisy of Chung and of her management company for only obliquely hinting at her [...] "licentiousness". On 14 February, two new nude photographs surfaced [...] one featuring an unidentified woman fellating Chen, and another showed a woman lying on a bed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Keswick, [...] "my {{parents died}} when I {{was quite a}} little fellow, and my aunt had charge of me until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{greeted me}} warmly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> taller, and he, <b>I</b> thought, <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> shorter and smaller and rounder but {{otherwise}} he was unchanged. He {{struck me as}} being rather shabby, and the silk hat he produced and put on, when, after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me, was past its first youth; but he was as buoyant and confident as ever.|$|R
2500|$|However, Sadoveanu's {{stories of}} the period often {{returned}} to a naturalistic perspective, particularly {{in a series of}} sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In La noi, la Viișoara ("At Our Place in Viișoara"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, {{to the point where he}} makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, [...] "The Mud-hut Dwellers"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: [...] "What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up and with them that I get along." [...] Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie ("Roving Times", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.|$|E
60|$|But at {{last the}} morning comes, and I find that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> into myself.|$|E
60|$|ALEEL. No, but you must. Seeing it cannot {{help her}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> tired of it.|$|E
60|$|He turned {{towards me}} with a look upon his face which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to hate--a look calm and gentle enough, but full of {{resolution}} as unchanging as the mountains which towered above us.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} there was a {{discussion}} about the identity of the author of the Iliad. When at school <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been made to take down notes on the subject until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to loathe the very name of Homer.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was really}} grieved, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{to like the}} urbane old gentleman, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like the cantankerous old lady. In spite of his fussiness and his Stock Exchange views on the {{interpretation}} of Scripture, his genuine kindliness and his real liking for me had softened my heart to him; and my face must have shown my distress, for the pea-green young man added quickly with an afterthought: 'But you needn't be afraid, yah know. It's all right for Harold Tillington. You ought to know {{that as well as}} anyone--and bettah: for it was you who drew up his will for him at Florence.' ...|$|R
60|$|HE. Oh, I don't mind. I am past minding anything. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{too fast}} this evening.|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. How I {{should have}} hated her twenty minutes ago! But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{out of that}} now.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Floy,' said Paul, {{holding a}} ringlet of {{her dark hair}} in his hand. 'Tell me, dear, Do you think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> old-fashioned?' ...|$|E
60|$|This offer did not {{altogether}} please me; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{very fond of}} Crowder, but the confidences of friends are often very embarrassing. At this moment the study door was gently opened, and Mrs. Crowder came in.|$|R
60|$|This {{tangle of}} my {{personal}} life, however, had {{not in the least}} affected my loyalty and duty to Vaughn Steele. Day by day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> more attached to him, keener in the interest of our work.|$|R
5000|$|... "I am lost {{after hearing}} this. I only knew him {{for about five}} years, and in that short time, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> really fond of him. We are all poorer today, having lost such a lovely person who touched us so deeply".|$|R
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Oh no. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> out of that. I {{love her}} now because she loved you, {{and because you}} love her.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth paused; 'possibly,' said she, 'in eyes, nose, and mouth; but, Helen, I do {{not think}} there ever could be anyone really like our mother; I was much {{too young to know}} all that she was whilst she was alive, but as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> older, and {{compared}} what I have seen of other people with what I recollect of her, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> certain that she must have been the most excellent, sensible, clever, kind, charming person that ever lived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I hope <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> {{rather more}} sensible. David set {{me to do}} stories for his lads, and, as he is dreadfully critical, it was very improving.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{speaking}} of the sea, if I remember," [...] he continued, like a man that was suddenly awakened from a deep reverie. [...] "Ay, I know it was of the sea; for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> boastful in my panegyrics: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> told you that this ship was faster than"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Our new {{acquaintance}} {{looking from}} one to the other of us declared: [...] "Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> so desperate that I'd have gone boldly up to the devil himself on the mere hint that he had a second mate's job to give away." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "With the 1960s and 1970s Canadian {{documentary}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up with, {{there was}} a lot of stationary camera work, and as a Native person, I felt that the camera was peering in at us- that the films offered a space that allowed people to laugh at us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} along finely," [...] the Black Sheep would answer, [...] "for not one sheep {{in the pasture}} has so much wool as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> already." ...|$|E
6000|$|ARJILLAX. Do you? Unfortunately for you, I am {{not still}} a child. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> out of cuddling. I can only {{appreciate}} your figure. Does that satisfy you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> lazy," [...] said Margaret, [...] "for I don't mind {{those things}} now. I am never sorry {{for a quiet}} time to {{recollect}} and consider." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> accustomed, {{since my}} arrival at Sanstead House, {{to a certain}} {{quickening}} of the pace of life, but tonight events succeeded one another with a rapidity which surprised me. A whole cinematograph-drama was enacted during the space of {{time it takes for}} a wooden match to burn.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me a little doubtfully. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{into the habit of}} {{consulting}} her about my work, of reading most of it to her. Sometimes, too, she acted as my secretary. Perhaps she saw something of the trouble in my face, for she answered me very softly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! At Blakely we were {{on terms}} of the most {{intimate}} friendship. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like and respect him more than any man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever met. <b>I</b> don't know exactly why I should take you so far into my confidence, but I am inclined to do so. Our friendship seemed likely to develop into--other things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was most}} {{fortunate}} {{to get the}} house," [...] she answered. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to love it. Sometimes {{it seems as though}} I had always lived here." ...|$|E
6000|$|His merriness gladdened her. [...] "They {{are only}} little things," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> to love them. I {{know they are}} flaws; but I love them because----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I'm afraid <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> conceited. Like Jeshurun, you know. When he waxed fat, then he kicked. It's the {{having no}} worry on one's {{mind and the}} Hill air, I suppose.' ...|$|E
60|$|About {{the house}} {{there was the}} same air of enchanted quiet which pervaded the grounds. Perhaps the stillness indoors was even more insistent. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> so {{accustomed}} to the never-ending noise and bustle of the boys' quarters that, as I crossed the silent hall, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an almost guilty sense of intrusion. I felt like a burglar.|$|R
5000|$|Renouvier {{became an}} {{important}} influence upon the thought of American psychologist and philosopher William James. James wrote that [...] "but for the decisive impression made on me in the 1870s by his masterly advocacy of pluralism, <b>I</b> might never <b>have</b> got free from the monistic superstition under which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up." ...|$|R
60|$|We had no {{real need}} of a guide but I {{was glad to have}} Wolf Voice riding with me, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to like him and welcomed any {{opportunity}} for conversing with him. He {{was one of the few}} full-bloods who could speak English well enough to enjoy a joke.|$|R
