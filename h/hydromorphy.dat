40|$|Abstract—Kaolin {{samples from}} the Jari deposit (Amazon region) were studied using various {{techniques}} to characterize its structural and crystallochemical aspects, and to establish its origin and evolution. A profile 60 m thick was selected in a kaolin mine (Morro do Felipe) located at {{the banks of the}} Jari river. Despite the great thickness of the deposit and the variety of kaolin types, the mineralogical composition is rather homogeneous and is mainly kaolinite associated with gibbsite and small amounts of quartz, anatase, goethite and hematite. The field observations and the morphological analysis indicate the existence of sedimentary features throughout the whole profile except for the upper aluminous clayey layer (Belterra Clay). This is evidence that the Rio Jari kaolin deposit originated from sedimentary material, the Alter do Chão Formation. The presence of alternating clay and sandy layers is explained by sedimentation processes with great depositional energy variation. Thus, the accumulation of thick clay layers was related to a low-energy phase, and during the high-energy phases, the deposition process led to the accumulation of sandy materials, constituted essentially of quartz and showing strong textural and structural variation. Later on, periods of <b>hydromorphy</b> were responsible for iron removal and consequently for the bleaching of the sedimentary formation. The crystallinity data show an increase of the structural disorder toward the surface associated with an increase in the amount of structural Fe in the kaolinite. The Rio Jari kaolin deposit...|$|E

A much cheaper strategy to preserve natural areas could be to simply identify areas of ecological interest and let it be known. A survey was launched in France to identify such areas (called ZNIEFF) in the early 1980 s. Since then, municipalities have had to account for ZNIEFFs in their formal land planning schemes, though they are not under any obligation to protect them. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of ZNIEFFs as a conservation tool {{in an area of}} high growth near Paris.

Overall, there was less urbanization inside ZNIEFFs, but this varied depending on the context. Surprisingly, they were better preserved in areas of more intense urbanization. This effect was increased if farmland area was already reduced (< 30 % of the municipality area). In contrast, when farmland was still predominant and urbanization rates were lower, ZNIEFFs tended to be more urbanized than the areas outside.

Low values of Feo point to the low content of poorly crystalline Fe oxides in analysed terra rossa. Feo/Fed ratios in the analysed profiles vary. In {{the upper part of the}} Pomer, Porec and Novigrad profiles Feo/Fed ratios are higher than in the lower part of those profiles which may be explained as a result of different pedogenic environments and/or additions of external materials in the upper part of those profiles.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{examines}} the lateral distribution of <b>hydromorphy</b> in the fine-grained alluvial deposits of the Eocene Pondaung Formation, central Myanmar. Through detailed outcrop analysis {{and using a}} combined sedimentological and pedological approach, this study proposes a reconstruction of Pondaung overbank floodplain palaeoenvironments. The variations of hydromorphic features in the different overbank sub-environments are then discussed and used to build a model of hydromorphic variability in alluvial deposits. Two main architectural associations with distinctive lithofacies and pedogenic features were identified, corresponding to different sub-environments: heterolithic deposits and extensive mudstone successions. The heterolithic deposits display variegated fine-grained lithofacies and contain poorly developed palaeosols with gley and vertic features, which are interpreted to reflect a seasonal wetlands landscape, developed in actively aggrading avulsion belts. Extensive mudstone successions with Vertisols that locally exhibit mukkara-style pseudogley features are interpreted to represent a distal open-forested environment. The palaeosols of both sub-environments display dense local hydromorphic variations they are also characterized by a gradual shift from gley-dominated to pseudogley-dominated features with increasing distance from the avulsion belt. The clay-dominated lithology of the floodplain parent material, which forms numerous subsurface permeability barriers, is shown to have acted as a fundamental control in limiting water-table dynamics in coarse-grained parts of the succession, thereby favouring hydromorphic variability. Palaeosol sequences of the Pondaung Formation contrast with the soil-landscape associations described in other studies and provide an alternative model with which {{to account for the}} hydromorphic variability in poorly drained, alluvial soils.

En los perfiles bien drenados y moderadamente bien drenados, los Fe d y Mn d mostraron escasa movilidad con valores entre 0, 50 - 0, 80 % y 0, 03 - 0, 06 %, respectivamente, y rasgos redoximórficos de escaso desarrollo con un índice Mn/Fe d The {{profiles of}} four soils with different drainage types were {{selected in the}} alluvial plain of Tucumán in order to analyze {{the intensity of the}} <b>hydromorphy</b> and detect which of the soils conforms to an aquic conditions.

The soils show endosaturation conditions for six months of the year, with an increase in water level during summer-autumn and a decrease in winter-spring. The degree of reduction was assessed in terms of the distribution of iron and manganese associated with redoximorphic features analyzed on a micromorphological scale. In the well-drained and moderately well-drained profiles, Fe d and Mn d show little mobility, with the respective values ranging from 0. 50 - 0. 80 % and 0. 03 - 0. 06 %, Mn d / Fe d < 0. 08 % and underdeveloped redoximorphic features. In the profiles with imperfect drainage, the Fe d sometimes co-migrates with and sometimes separates from clay, with the segregation of Fe d outside the profile. Mn d has low values (0. 01 - 0. 06 %) with an increase of 0. 20 % in the BC of La Fronterita X, Mn/Fe d = 0. 33 and more developed redox features. The analysis suggests that the hydromorphic process increases from the moderately well-drained La Fronterita XI profile towards the imperfectly drained La Fronterita X and Famaillá profiles. The former two profiles are expressed in the Mn/Fe d ratio and in the increasing size and abundance of redox features as observed on a micromorphological scale; and the Famaillá profile in the low mean value of Fe d and Mn, and the presence of redoximorphic features.

40|$|In the past, {{the term}} “terra rossa” became quite a common {{indication}} for all limestone derived red soils in the Mediterranean region. Today, in some classification systems {{based on the}} Mediterranean climate as the major soil differentiating criterion, the term terra rossa {{is used as a}} name for the soil subclass “Modal Fersiallitic Red soil” when situated on limestones (Duchaufour, 1982). However, several national soil classifications (e. g. Croatian, Italian, Israeli) retained the term “terra rossa” for the hard limestone derived red soils. The nature and relationship of terra rossa to underlying carbonates is a long-standing problem which has resulted in different opinions with respect to the parent material and origin of terra rossa. Terra rossa is a reddish clayey to silty-clay material, which covers limestone and dolomite {{in the form of a}} discontinuous layer ranging in thickness from a few centimetres to several metres. It is also found along cracks and between bedding surfaces of limestones and dolomites. Thick accumulations of terra rossa like material are situated in karst depressions in the form of pedo-sedimentary complexes. A bright red colour is a diagnostic feature of terra rossa and is a result of the preferential formation of haematite over goethite, i. e. rubification. Terra rossa can be considered as soil, vetusol, relict soil (non-buried-paleosol), paleosol or pedo-sedimentary complex (soil-sediments) among different authors. Most authors today believe that terra rossa is polygenetic relict soil formed during the Tertiary and/or hot and humid periods of the Quaternary. However, some recent investigation in the Atlantic coastal region of Morocco (Bronger & Sedov, 2002) show that at least some terra rossa previously referred to as polygenetic relict soils should be regarded as Vetusols. In some isolated karst terrain, terra rossa may have formed exclusively from the insoluble residue of limestone and dolomite but much more often it comprises a span of parent materials including, for example, aaeolian dust, volcanic material or sedimentary clastic rocks which were derived on carbonate terrain via different transport mechanisms. Boero & Schwertmann (1989) concluded that it is of little relevance for the process of rubification whether the primary Fe sources are autochthonous or allochthonous as long as the general pedoenvironment remains essentially suitable for the formation of terra rossa. This pedoenvironment is characterised by an association of Mediterranean climate, high internal drainage due to the karstic nature of a hard limestone and neutral pH conditions. Terra rossa is formed as a result of: (1) decalcification, (2) rubification and (3) bisiallitization and/or monosiallitization. Since Fed/clay ratios are relatively uniform in most terra rossa, translocation of clay particles is responsible for the distribution of the red colour throughout the whole profile. However, since terra rossa soils have been exposed to various climatic fluctuations they can be affected by eluviation, yellowing and secondary <b>hydromorphy.</b> Erosion and deposition processes which were superimposed on karst terrains and induced by climatic changes, tectonic movements and/or deforestation might be responsible for both the patchy distribution of terra rossa and thick colluvial or alluvial terra rossa accumulations in uvala and dolina type of karst depressions (pedo-sedimentary complexes, soil-sediments) ...|$|E
40|$|The Strahler stream {{order is}} a well known {{indicator}} ranking rivers, stretches, catchments and sub-catchments. It is widely used in one hand for geomorphology and in a second hand for hydrobiological purposes. We attempt here to extent {{the use of the}} stream order as a relevant indicator for modelling the spatial distribution of the hydromorphic soils - or the valley bottom wetlands - and the buffering efficiency of these wetlands. This attempt was illustrated by 2 case studies: the Vilaine River, 10 000 km 2 and the Scorff River, 400 km 2. a) Many researches have been done for predicting the occurrence of hydromorphic soils in small catchments, based on a simple topographic index taking into account the local slope and the upslope drainage area, as defined for instance by Beven & Kirkby (1979). In our study, this simple topographic index modelling predicts an increase in <b>hydromorphy</b> in high-order channel settings (orders 6 - 7). By contrast, field mapping suggests that hydromorphic zone extent remains stable with increasing order and decreases significantly for high-order settings (orders 6 - 7). Therefore, topographic index modelling appears effective in upper catchment settings (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd order). On the contrary, modelling efficiency is limited in high-order settings where the indices prove to be inappropriate: in such contexts, interactions between adjacent hillslope and hydromorphic zone are of secondary importance. In high-order settings, the fine-scale valley bottomland topography and the spatial organisation of deposits control waterlogging duration and possibly {{play a major role in}} hydromorphic zone extent. Finally, the integration of stream order data should considerably improve the efficiency of modelling the spatial distribution of soils over large catchments. b) In the second case, our study aims to assess the role of wetland and river systems, in relation with the seasons and stream order, in buffering the fluxes and concentrations of nitrate in a 400 km agricultural catchment. A statistical analysis allows us to identify the relations between these characteristics and the nitrate fluxes and concentrations. The two main factors identified as controlling annual nitrate fluxes are on the one hand, the nitrogen surplus derived from agricultural activities and, on the other hand, the system comprising the wetland zone and adjoining watercourses. This latter factor exhibits a depletion of nitrate fluxes proportional to the surface-area of the riparian wetland and the flowpath distance of these fluxes in the stream network. The buffer role of riparian wetlands and rivers is more important during periods of low water level and for high stream orders. This dependence on stream order can be explained by the landscape structure, the increased mean length of in-stream watercourse in the drainage network, and the joint processes. In these 2 cases, we observed a change in the controlling factors: interactions between adjacent hillslope and hydromorphic zone become progressively weak when the stream order increases and, in reverse, the impact of local bottomland topography and the exchange with the stream increase. Finally, the integration of stream order data to understand and model the structure and the function of catchments in geomorphology, but also in soil science, geochemistry, and hydrology is a relevant tool to capture their heterogeneity at different scales...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceWithin the French {{national program}} Inventaire Gestion et Conservation des Sols (IGCS), a central {{purpose is to}} provide a DSM at regional scale (Référentiel Régional Pédologique). For the Brittany region, soils maps are rare, as the existing ones, not yet digitized, covers approximately 20 % of the area to the 1 / 100 000 and less than 15 % to the 1 / 25 ° 000. Facing this lack of spatial data on soils, the idea is to map soil-landscape units (Unités de Pédo Paysages : UPP) to the 1 / 250 000, and inform each UPP with a definition of local soils typology (Unités Typologiques de Sols : UTS). This concept of soil-landscape units results from the general idea, established in various disciplines, that there are functional links and reciprocal constraints between environmental factors (hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere). Specifics adaptations and the relative equilibrium of the system assumes a relation between natural vegetation and soils, either at regional scale and local scale. In Brittany, where about 80 % of the surface is devoted to agricultural land since ages, the variety of landscapes are strongly related to the variety of soils. As traditional agriculture (until 1970) was much more dependant on the land (so called “terroir”), we notice that the main agricultural landscape patterns, (size and geometry of parcels, crops rotations or grass land locations, density of hedgerow network, waste land [...] .), still remaining, are revealing soils attributes. Thus, according to the S. C. O. R. P. A. N. model, in region like Brittany O {{is an important factor in}} order to achieve DSM, but it's also important to note where the actual human activities forces soils evolution (urbanisation, protected woodland [...] .). Remote sensing is obviously the main source of data to map landscape units at regional scale, but one must look carefully how to analyse landscape units, including soils properties like surface <b>hydromorphy,</b> without simply focus on land use classification. We would like to présent two methodological aspects of our work on DSM : 1) The object-oriented image analysis present very interesting opportunities applied to landscapes mapping. Indeed, as landscape is a complex spatial organisation of various elements, pixel-based classifications are not sufficient. Taking account of the neighbourhood, with cover frequency vectors for exemple, gives information on diversity and heterogeneity, but is still limited concerning spatial informations. Using an object oriented approach for the segmentation and classification of Landsat TM images with eCognition software underline the role of patterns in landscape discrimination (linear woodland in a valley, large parcells of cereals in plains, small parcells of grass land on hills, mixed or homogenous spatial organisation [...] .). Beyong the accuracy of landscape classification, the object oriented image analysis has a great interest concerning DSM for at least two reasons : first because landscape patterns are more stable than the land use their contain, second because these patterns can have an influence on soils (erosion [...] .). Object oriented image analysis can also help to deal with scale issues in DSM using a hierarchical approach. 2) Choosing specific variables according to the scale of DSM can be a way of working with the SCORPAN model. Mappping soil-landscape units (UPP) at regional scale, and soils types at local scale, we have to analyse how the SCORPAN factors interfere according to the scale level, looking for the best variables at each level. Obviously scale issues are not just a question of spatial resolution of the digital data or techniques for down or upscaling. We would focus on SCORP variables that are discriminating for units caracteristics at regional scale but insufficient for local variability (agricultural morphology, elevations, spectral radiometrics, climatics indice based on temperature and précipitations [...] .). Then we also examine the consistency with local variables (slopes, distance to the rivers, parent material, aspect, land use, [...] .) witch could be confusing at regional scale. These are combine using different techniques (fuzzy logic) and both largely use remote sensing as the main -but not unique- source of data (Landsat TM, MODIS, AVHRR [...] .) ...|$|E
