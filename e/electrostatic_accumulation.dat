30|$|Energy {{security}} {{and global warming}} are facing serious challenges with increasing of the enormous depletion of traditional fossil fuel. The development of environment-friendly, green and sustainable energy storage devices with high energy and power output, and long life span are urgently needed [1]. Hence, in recent decades, supercapacitors have attracted considerable attention {{for a new generation}} energy storage devices due to its advantages of fast charge/discharge rate, high power density and excellent cycle stability [2 – 4]. Supercapacitors can be divided into electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors according to the charge storage mechanism. EDLCs, also known as carbon-based supercapacitors, have high power density and long cycle life arising from the reversible physical <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>accumulation</b> at the electrode/electrolyte interface [5]. However, the electrochemical capacitance and energy density of EDLCs are still low because of the limited specific surface area, which severely hindered their commercialization [6]. On the contrary, pseudocapacitors possess higher energy density than EDLCs owing to the surface faradic redox reaction, but sacrifice the power density and the cycle life. Therefore, the most important in the development of supercapacitors is to increase their energy density without destroying its high power capability and long cycle stability.|$|R

It has been observed that voltage waveforms generated by power frequency converters may affect significantly the reliability of electric motor insulation system. Over voltage problems in long cable drives due to step voltage pulse rise time became an important research area during the last decade. The over voltage phenomenon is usually described using the traveling wave and reflection phenomena. For {{better understanding of the}} processes in long cable drives distributed-parameter representation in simulations is used. The problem with bearing currents is well known. Besides magnetic dissymmetries, other causes exist for bearing currents, such as voltage potential accidentally applied to the shaft, <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>accumulation,</b> and common-mode voltages generated by unbalanced excitation of the motor windings. Any of the above could cause bearing currents and bearing failures.

Here, we show that the use of glycolated side chains on a thiophene backbone can result in accumulation mode OECTs with high currents, transconductance, and sharp subthreshold switching, while maintaining fast switching speeds. Compared with alkylated analogs of the same backbone, the triethylene glycol side chains shift the mode of operation of aqueous electrolyte-gated transistors from interfacial to bulk doping/transport and show complete and reversible electrochromism and high volumetric capacitance at low operating biases. We propose that the glycol side chains facilitate hydration and ion penetration, without compromising electronic mobility, and suggest that this synthetic approach can be used to guide the design of organic mixed conductors...|$|R

Although EDLCs exhibit ultrahigh power density and distinguished long-term cycling performance, the stored energy is limited by the finite electrical charge separation at the interface between electrolyte and electrode materials [3].

The spatial confinement of charged sites and binding sites to the nanoparticulate body impacts on the time scales of various steps in the overall complex formation process.

A z+ metal ion (z > 1) in a 1 : 1 background electrolyte will accumulate in the counterionic atmosphere around negatively charged simple ions, as well as within/around the body of a soft nanoparticle with negative structural charge. The rate of accumulation is often governed by diffusion and proceeds until Boltzmann partition equilibrium between the charged entity and the ions in the medium is attained. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accumulation</b> proceeds simultaneously with outer-sphere and inner-sphere complex formation. The rate of the eventual inner-sphere complex formation is generally controlled by the rate constant of dehydration of the metal ion, kw.

Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) is a prototypical correlated insulator that shows an insulator-to-metal transition at ∼ 67 °C and recent studies have noted a vast range of electronic effects in electric double-layer transistors (EDLT). In this study, we demonstrate that the response of electrolyte gated VO 2 devices can be deterministically controlled by inserting a monolayer of graphene at the oxide-electrolyte interface. Several electrolytes as well as dopants (such as lithium ions and protons) were employed in EDL transistors to show that graphene serves as an inert barrier that successfully protects the oxide surface from chemical reactions.

40|$|There are {{clusters}} of {{basic amino acids}} on many cytoplasmic proteins that bind transiently to membranes (e. g., protein kinase C) {{as well as on}} the cytoplasmic domain of many intrinsic membrane proteins (e. g., glycophorin). To explore the possibility that these basic residues bind electrostatically to monovalent acidic lipids, we studied the binding of the peptides Lysn and Argn (n = 1 - 5) to bilayer membranes containing phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylglycerol (PG). We made electrophoretic mobility measurements using multilamellar vesicles, fluorescence and equilibrium binding measurements using large unilamellar vesicles, and surface potential measurements using monolayers. None of the peptides bound to vesicles formed from the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) but all bound to vesicles formed from PC/PS or PC/PG mixtures. None of the peptides exhibited specificity between PS and PG. Each lysine residue that was added to Lys 2 decreased by one order of magnitude the concentration of peptide required to reverse the charge on the vesicle; equivalently it increased by one order of magnitude the binding affinity of the peptides for the PS vesicles. The simplest explanation is that each added lysine binds independently to a separate PS with a microscopic association constant of 10 M- 1 or a free energy of approximately 1. 4 kcal/mol. Similar, but not identical, results were obtained with the Argn peptides. A simple theoretical model combines the Gouy-Chapman theory (which accounts for the nonspecific <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accumulation</b> of the peptides in the aqueous diffuse double layer adjacent to the membrane) with mass action equations (which account for the binding of the peptides to greater than 1 PS).

30|$|According to the {{equation}} of energy density (E =  0.5 CV 2), the energy density can be enhanced by increasing the specific capacitance (C) or the voltage window (V) [16, 17, 18, 19]. On the one hand, developing appropriate electrode materials favors enhancing the specific capacitance and correspondingly improving the energy density [20, 21, 22]. Based on the energy storage mechanisms, electrode materials can be classified into two types: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors. The EDLC electrode material stores energy based on <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>accumulation</b> on the surface between the electrode and electrolyte [23, 24, 25, 26]. Carbon materials have mostly been used because of their high specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, and excellent stability. Among them, graphene, a single-atom-thick sheet of hexagonally arrayed sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms, which has a high theoretical specific capacitance of 550  F g− 1, {{has emerged as a}} promising candidate for electrode materials [27, 28, 29, 30]. Pseudocapacitive electrode materials mainly rely on fast and reversible faradic reactions to store energy. Transition metal oxides and hydroxides have extensively been developed as electrode materials of this type. However, considering their poor electronic conductivity, various transition metal hydroxides and oxides combined with electrically conductive frameworks, such as a carbon cloth (CC) and Ni foam, have attracted increasing attention [31, 32, 33]. For example, Yu et al. have reported that NiFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles can be directly grown on a flexible CC substrate by a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method that showed good electrochemical properties [34]. This designed device possessed several advantages including flexibility, a binder-free process, and portability, which are more desirable for portable electronic devices.|$|R
30|$|Electrochemical {{capacitors}}, {{also known}} as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are energy storage systems that differ from regular capacitors in that they have ultrahigh capacitance, long cycle life, and high power density[1 – 3]. Supercapacitors have many applications ranging from hybrid automobiles and large industrial equipment to storage devices for solar cells and portable consumer electronics[3, 4]. Supercapacitors {{can be divided into}} two categories: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. In EDLCs, different forms of carbon are commonly used as active electrode materials, and the capacitance results from <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>accumulations</b> at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces[5 – 7]. In contrast, in redox or pseudocapacitors, in which transition metal oxides such as RuO 2 ·x H 2 O and MnO 2 and electronically conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole are used as active electrode materials[8 – 11], charge storage results from fast and reversible faradic reactions at the surface of the electroactive materials. Among the many candidates for supercapacitor electrode materials, mesoporous carbon spheres[12], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and/or carbon nanofibers (CNFs)[13 – 16], CNT/polypyrrole composites[17], and MnO 2 /CNT composites[18] have attracted much attention due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area, chemical inertness, and high operating temperature range. Several methods have been developed to synthesize CNTs and CNFs including arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)[19 – 21]. In the CVD process, transition metals such as nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), or their combination are used as the catalyst and are often deposited onto the substrates before the CNTs and CNFs are grown[22]. Then, carbon-containing precursor gases such as methane (CH 4)[23], acetylene (C 2 H 2)[24], ethylene (C 2 H 4)[25], or ethane (C 2 H 6)[26] with the carrier gases (argon and/or hydrogen) are introduced into the CVD system and decompose at the catalyst sites to form CNTs or CNFs at the corresponding gas decomposition temperature.|$|R

The mechanism and rate of oxidation of dimethyl sulfide by gold(III) complexes depends on the concentration of free halide. High halide concentration leads to reduction of trans-dicyano(dimethylsulfide) halidegold(III) (halide = Cl or Br) through attack by free dimethyl sulfide on co-ordinated halide. Low halide concentration allows formation of trans-dicyanobisdimethylsulfidegold(III), which is reduced intermolecularly with assistance from a water molecule. Oxidation of the thioether is much more rapid at high chloride concentration, suggesting that the extra-cellular environment strongly favours this type of reaction in vivo. The use of DNA containing thiones in the form of 4 -thiouridine or 6 -thioinosine allowed for evaluation of the specific interaction of this site with metal complexes by UV/Vis detection technique. The nucleophilicity of both thiones was found to be better than that of guanine-N 7. The pH dependence for 2. 0 thiouridine > thioinosine > G-N 7, indicates a dependence on the distance from the phosphate backbone. The reaction profile for the platination of a single G-N 7 that is moved along the oligomer suggests an additional influence from <b>electrostatic,</b> polyelectrolyte-like <b>accumulation</b> of cations. Inspection of the activation parameters (enthalpy, entropy, volume) shows that the difference in reactivity between the monomers and oligomers is largely due to contributions from the activation entropies. For the latter type of reactions, the entropy values are substantially more positive, which is interpreted as a result of pre-association of the cationic metal complex onto the oligomer, and concomitant release of monovalent cations such as sodium and potassium from the surface. The similar type of reaction characteristics, here demonstrated for the cations with an inherent reactivity spanning 4 orders of magnitude, suggest a common reaction mechanism for these structural analogs of anticancer active Pt(II) complexes, where preassociation is followed by rapid reorganisation and/or migration of the metal reagent {{on the surface of the}} oligomer prior to the rate determining reaction...|$|R

So far, the antistatic additives used were chosen to make the final material/composite conductive to dissipate the surface charges, by either directly doping with conductive materials (e. g. metals or carbon powder), or by doping with additives (e. g. ions) to increase surface humidity. The doped materials usually lose their inherent properties such as the mechanical properties {{because of the high}} concentrations of the additive. To provide a more universal solution to this problem and avoid the changes in the material properties after doping, the mechanism of static charge formation, which has been on debate for many years, should be clarified. Recent studies of our group and others have shown that the main mechanism behind the charge formation on electrified (polymer) materials is the bond-breakages on the surfaces of the materials, which lead to mechanoanion, mechanocation, mechanoradical active ends. The former two accounts for the charge on the surfaces and, as we have shown, the latter group (mechanoradicals) stabilizes the charged species. Previously, in our group, it was shown that by removing the mechanoradicals with radical scavenger antioxidants one can destabilize the charges – doping with antioxidants makes materials antistatic. However, the scavenger antioxidants we had used in this example to show the antistatic behavior were far from being practical in use for general polymers -that are produces in millions of tons per year- because of their individual prices. Lignin is the world’s second most abundant polymer. It has antioxidant properties, so it is a good candidate as an antistatic agent for common polymers. In this study we assess the lignin’s antistatic action by doping it into common polymers - elastomers (silicon rubber) and thermoplastics (PE, PP, PVC), and comparing the accumulated net charge on the doped and undoped polymers upon contact electrification. It was shown that the increase in lignin concentration and decrease in particle size of the lignin enhances the antistatic property in the polymers, due to an increase in radical scavenging OH groups, as verified by 31 P-NMR analysis. We certify that the antistatic property is because of the radical scavenging action and not by increase in the surface conductivity. By doping polymers with cheap and abundant lignin, we provide a more universal, environment-friendly method for preventing <b>electrostatic</b> charge <b>accumulation</b> on common polymers, which are produced in millions of tons per year. by Tutku Bedük.

40|$|Model V {{describes}} the binding of ions by humic substances {{in terms of}} complexation at discrete sites, modified by electrostatic attraction and/or repulsion, and also takes account of nonspecific binding due to counterion accumulation. The model operates over wide ranges of pH (3 – 11) and ionic strength (0. 001 - 1 M). Electrostatic effects on specific binding are described with an empirical relationship involving net humic charge and an <b>electrostatic</b> interaction factor. <b>Accumulation</b> of counterions is described by Donnan-type expressions. The model assumes the presence of eight proton-dissociating groups in the humic material, distinguished by intrinsic pK values. In general, the description of proton dissociation requires seven parameters, but for fulvic-type material only six are needed. The proton-dissociating groups may interact individually with other ions, or pairs of them may form bidentate sites. Binding at the monodentate and bidentate sites is characterized by intrinsic equilibrium constants for cation-proton exchange; there are two such constants (pKMHA and pKMHB) for each cation. Model parameters are derived from published data for fulvic-type material on proton dissociation (eight data sets) and metal binding (twenty-six data sets, eleven metals). In the case of proton dissociation, the greatest variability among samples is in site densities, while intrinsic dissociation constants and electrostatic interaction factors are relatively consistent. With parameters for proton dissociation fixed, adjustments of pKMHA and pKMHB permit reasonable fitting of metal binding data, including pH dependence. There are insufficient available data to evaluate properly ionic strength and competition effects on metal binding, but correct trends are reproduced by the model. Values of pKMHA for metals indicate that binding strength increases in the order Mg 2 + < Ca 2 + < Mn 2 + < Cd 2 + < Co 2 + < Ni 2 + ~ Zn 2 + < Pb 2 + < Cu 2 + < VO 2 +. The strong correlation between pKMHA and the analogous constant for lactic acid may be useful for estimating values of pKMHA in cases where humic binding data are lacking...|$|R
