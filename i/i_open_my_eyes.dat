25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or {{looking up at the}} stars. [...] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God.". He {{was a member of a}} Unitarian Universalist Church in New York.|$|E
6000|$|The Red Marine turned slightly, {{speaking}} with the awful precision of the half-drunk. [...] "'As 'e got any-thin' in about my 'orrible death an' execution? Excuse me, but if <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I shan't be well. That's where I'm different from all other men. Ahem!" ...|$|E
60|$|Comforted not {{a little}} by this assurance, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and looked up.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Franklin's name roused me. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and made}} <b>my</b> girl explain herself.|$|R

6000|$|... "But a {{very good}} one," [...] {{returned}} the Clown. [...] "It is really a big music-box under the bench, which starts playing every morning at seven o'clock. So, instead of being awakened by a rattling and clanging of bells, such as most alarm clocks make, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> with a sensation of pleasure, and get up feeling jolly and content.|$|E
60|$|But {{one night}} I sleep, and, when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{he is no}} longer near me. I run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent corridor. The {{tapestry}} is drawn aside, and the hidden door stands open, and in the room beyond the friend that I loved is kneeling before an open chest, and the glint of the gold is in my eyes.|$|E
60|$|And next, {{after the}} blackness, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{in the early}} dawn to see a Japanese woman, solicitously anxious, bending over me. She is the port pilot's wife and I am lying in her doorway. I am chilled and shivering, sick with the after-sickness of debauch. And I feel lightly clad. Those rascals of runaway apprentices! They have {{acquired}} the habit of running away. They have run away with my possessions. My watch is gone. My few dollars are gone. My coat is gone. So is my belt. And yes, my shoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I pulled back, made fast {{again to}} the jetty, {{and then went to}} sleep at last. I had faced the silence of the East. I had heard some of its languages. But when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again the silence was as {{complete}} as though it had never been broken. I was lying in a flood of light, and the sky had never looked so far, so high, before. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and lay without moving.|$|R
60|$|When I {{recovered}} my senses, my {{face was}} fairly scorched, and no sooner had <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> than they were blinded by smoke and flame.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trot, my dear,' she said, when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'I couldn't {{make up my}} mind {{to disturb}} you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I-to her!'Said Miriam, {{coarsely}} imitating {{his tone}} of shocked humility. 'I, the poor penniless boy-scholar, to her, the great, rich, wise, worshipped she-philosopher, {{who holds the}} sacred keys of the inner shrine of the east wind--and just because I am a man, and the handsomest man in Alexandria, and she a woman, and the vainest woman in Alexandria; and therefore I am stronger than she, and can twist her round my finger, and bring her to her knees at my feet when I like, as soon <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and discover that I am a man. Eh, boy! Did she ever teach you that among her mathematics and metaphysics, and gods and goddesses?' ...|$|E
6000|$|When Jerome Searing {{recovered}} consciousness {{he did not}} at once {{understand what}} had occurred. It was, indeed, some time before he opened his eyes. For a while he believed that he had died and been buried, {{and he tried to}} recall some portions of the burial service. He thought that his wife was kneeling upon his grave, adding her weight to that of the earth upon his breast. The two of them, widow and earth, had crushed his coffin. Unless the children should persuade her to go home he would not much longer be able to breathe. He felt a sense of wrong. [...] "I cannot speak to her," [...] he thought; [...] "the dead have no voice; and if <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I shall get them full of earth." ...|$|E
60|$|Each {{day this}} thought of Peace becomes more real and blessed. I can lie on this green hill and praise Creation that I am alive {{in a world}} of beauty. I can go to sleep up here with the coverlet of {{sunlight}} warm on my body, and not wake to that old dull misery. I can even dream with a light heart, for my fair dreams will not be spoiled by waking, and my bad dreams will be cured the moment <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I can look up at that blue sky without seeing trailed across it a mirage of the long horror, a film picture {{of all the things that}} have been done by men to men. At last I can gaze up at it, limpid and blue, without a dogging melancholy; and I can gaze down at that far gleam of sea, knowing that there is no murk of murder on it any more.|$|E
60|$|Even as I spoke, {{somebody}} else raised {{my head and}} poured something down my throat. I swallowed it with a gulp. Then <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Gradually I {{was aware}} of {{somebody}} moistening my temples. A soft palm held my hand. Elsie was leaning over me. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> with a start.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> Woola, too, moved and, {{coming up}} to his haunches, stared through the {{intervening}} brush toward the road, each hair upon his neck stiffly erect.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{preceding}} chapter we agreed, though {{without being able}} to find demonstrative reasons, that it is rational to believe that our sense-data--for example, those which we regard as associated with my table--are really signs of the existence of something independent of us and our perceptions. That is to say, over and above the sensations of colour, hardness, noise, and so on, which make up the appearance of the table to me, I assume that there is something else, of which these things are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes, the sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from contact with the table, the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the table with my knuckles. But I do not believe that when all these things cease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because the table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> replace my arm, and begin again to rap with my knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: What is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my perception of it? ...|$|E

60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again <b>I</b> {{found myself}} lying upon {{a bed in}} a strange room. By my side was my father, leaning back in a low, easy chair.|$|R
