500|$|The HTC One shipped with Android 4.1.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] and version 5.0 of HTC’s {{proprietary}} Sense software suite. In {{comparison to}} previous {{versions of the}} software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the Roboto font family. Instead of a traditional home screen display with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a news aggregator which displays a scrolling grid of news <b>headlines</b> <b>from</b> selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and social network content {{in a similar fashion}} to Flipboard and Windows Phone’s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi. Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user’s local time and weather forecast; the signature flip clock widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC’s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen. The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions. Apps can also be sorted into folders within the drawer; a number of preset folders are provided, such as [...] "Google", [...] "Media", [...] "Productivity", [...] "Tools", and pre-loaded apps provided by the user’s wireless carrier, where applicable.|$|E
