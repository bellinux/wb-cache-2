Because the rule system is not tied to any particular content domain, it is possible to improve it by formal teaching techniques. We present four experiments that support this view. In Experiments 1 and 2, we taught subjects about the formal properties of the law of large numbers in brief training sessions in the laboratory and found that this increased both the frequency and the quality of statistical reasoning {{for a wide variety of}} problems of an everyday nature. In addition, we taught subjects about the rule by a "guided induction" technique, showing them how to use the rule to solve problems in particular domains. Learning from the examples was abstracted to such an extent that subjects showed just as much improvement on domains where the rule was not taught as on domains where it was. In Experiment 3, the ability to analyze an everyday problem with reference to the law of large numbers was shown to be much greater for those who had several years of training in statistics than for those who had less. Experiment 4 demonstrated that the beneficial effects of formal training in statistics may hold even when subjects are tested completely outside of the context of training. In general, these four experiments support a rather "formalist" theory of reasoning: people reason using very abstract rules, and their reasoning about a wide variety of content domains can be affected by direct manipulation of these abstract rules...|$|E

This distinction cannot be explained by accounts of reasoning formulated purely in terms of necessity and sufficiency, because causes and enabling conditions hold the same logical relationship to the effect in those terms.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation is an inferentialist {{account of}} classical population genetics. I present the theory as a definite body of interconnected <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> for generating mathematical models of population dynamics. To state those rules, I use {{the notion of}} causation as a primitive. First, I put forward a rule stating the circumstances of application of the theory, one that uses causal language {{to pick out the}} types of entities over which the theory may be deployed. Next, I offer a rule for grouping such entities into populations based on their competitive causal relationships. Then I offer a general algorithm for generating classical population genetics models for such populations {{on the basis of what}} causal influences operate within them. Dynamical models in population genetics are designed to demystify natural phenomena, chiefly to show how adaptation, altruism, and genetic polymorphism can be explained in terms of natural rather than supernatural processes. In order for the theory to serve this purpose, it must be possible to understand, in a principled fashion, when and how to deploy the theory. By presenting the theory as a system of ordered <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> that takes causal information as its critical input and yields dynamical models as its outputs, I show explicitly how classical population genetics functions as a non-circular theoretical apparatus for generating explanations. The generalization of the theory achieved by presenting it using causal vocabulary shows how the scope of the theory of natural selection extends beyond its traditional domain of systems distinguished by genetic variations...|$|R

Historically, motivated reasoning theory identifies that directional goals enhance the accessibility of knowledge structures (memories, information, knowledge) that are consistent with desired conclusions. This theory endorses previous research on accessing information, but adds a procedural component in specifying that the motivation to achieve directional goals will also influence which rules (procedural structures such as <b>inferential</b> <b>rules)</b> and which beliefs are accessed to guide the search for information. In this model the beliefs and rule structures are instrumental in directing which information will be obtained to support the desired conclusion.|$|R

5000|$|An {{apparent}} {{problem with}} this was pointed out by Arthur Prior: Why can't we have an expression (call it [...] "tonk") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from [...] "p" [...] to [...] "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from [...] "p tonk q" [...] to [...] "q")? This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point. Prior suggested that this meant that <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> could not determine meaning. He was answered by Nuel Belnap, that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary. These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.|$|R
50|$|In {{his early}} {{epistemological}} system, {{which he called}} Radical Conventionalism, Ajdukiewicz analyzed any language {{as a set of}} expressions or sentences, with <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> of meaning that specify the relation of one expression to another, or to external data. There are three kinds of rules: Axiomatic, Deductive, and Empirical. Following the rules, one can map all knowable sentences of a language. However, some languages' vocabularies can produce disconnected sentences, which are only partly mapped by the meaning rules. Therefore, when one uses a language, even scientific one, a conceptual apparatus, an untranslatable set of meanings, is needed too, and with it a choice of the problems to be settled. For this reason the theory is a form of Conventionalism, and it is radical because even simple experiential reports are exposed to these language-wide considerations. Ajdukiewicz discarded this theory as the 1930s progressed.|$|R

40|$|According to {{inferential}} role semantics (IRS), for {{any given}} expression to possess a particular meaning one must be disposed to make or, alternatively, acknowledge as correct certain inferential transitions involving it.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify heuristics that influence perceived breast cancer risk. We examined 11 interviews from women of diverse ethnic/cultural backgrounds who were recruited from community settings. Narratives in which women elaborated about their own breast cancer risk were analyzed with Argument and Heuristic Reasoning Analysis methodology, which is based on applied logic. The availability, simulation, representativeness, affect, and perceived control heuristics, and search for a dominance structure were commonly used for making risk assessments. Risk assessments were based on experiences with an abnormal breast symptom, experiences with affected family members and friends, beliefs about living a healthy lifestyle, and trust in health providers. Assessment of the potential threat of a breast symptom was facilitated by the search for a dominance structure. Experiences with family members and friends were incorporated into risk assessments through the availability, simulation, representativeness, and affect heuristics. Mistrust in health providers led to an inappropriate dependence on the perceived control heuristic. Identified heuristics appear to create predictable biases and suggest that perceived breast cancer risk is based on common cognitive patterns.

40|$|Abstract Symbolic {{reasoning}} {{is a well}} understood and effective approachto handling reasoning over formally represented knowledge; however, simple symbolic inference systems necessarily slowas complexity and ground facts grow. As automated approaches to ontology-building become more prevalent and sophisticated,knowledge base systems become larger and more complex, necessitating techniques for faster inference. This work uses re-inforcement learning, a statistical machine learning technique, to learn control laws which guide inference. We implement ourlearning method in ResearchCyc, a very large knowledge base with millions of assertions. A large set of test queries, some ofwhich require {{tens of thousands of}} inference steps to answer, can be answered faster after training over an independent setof training queries. Furthermore, this learned inference module outperforms ResearchCyc's integrated inference module, amodule that has been hand-tuned with considerable effort. IntroductionLogical reasoning systems {{have a long history of}} success and have proven to be powerful tools for assisting in solving cer-tain classes of problems. However, those successes are limited by the computational complexity of na&quot;ive inference meth-ods, which may grow exponentially with the number of <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> and amount of available background knowledge. As automated learning and knowledge acquisition techniques (e. g. (Etzioni et al. 2004; Matuszek et al. 2005)) make verylarge knowledge bases available, performing inference efficiently over large amounts of knowledge becomes progres-sively more crucial. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to learn to guide inference efficiently via reinforcementlearning, a popular statistical machine learning technique...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of how systems of thought arise {{on the basis of}} differing {{cultural}} practices and argue that the theory accounts for substantial differences in East Asian and Western thought processes. We find East Asians to be more holistic, attending to the entire field and assigning causality to it, making relatively little use of categories and formal logic, and relying on "dialectical" reasoning. Westerners are more analytic, paying attention primarily to the object and the categories to which it belongs and using rules, including formal logic, to understand its behavior. The two types of cognitive processes are embedded in different nave metaphysical systems and tacit epistemologies. We speculate that the origin of these differences is traceable to markedly different social systems. The theory and the evidence presented call into question long held assumptions about basic cognitive processes and even about the appropriateness of the process-content distinction. The British empiricist philosophers of the 18 and 19 centuries, including Locke, Hume, and Mill, wrote about cognitive processes {{as if they were the}} same for all normal adults. This assumption of universality was adopted by mainstream psychology of the 20 century, where it has been predominant from the earliest treatment of cognitive psychology by Piaget, to midcentury learning theorists, to modern cognitive science. The assumption of universality was probably strengthened by the analogy to the computer, which has been implicit and often explicit for the past thirty years (Block, 1995; Shweder, 1991). Brain equals hardware, <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> and data processing procedures equal the universal software, and output equals belief and behavior, which can of course be radically different given the differ [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The general aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} in this thesis is to investigate the viability of applying theories and principles {{from the field of}} natural language pragmatics to that of human-computer interaction. In pursuing this aim, the research falls broadly into three phases. The first of these is the exploitation and adaptation of the Gricean Cooperative Principle, its maxims and <b>inferential</b> <b>rules</b> to situations of computer use which do not employ natural language as the medium of communication. The purpose of this endeavour is to provide a novel and revealing analysis of non natural language interaction and to establish principles for dialogue design, the application of which enhance the quality of communication between system and user in such situations. The second phase concerns the application of the adapted Gricean principles to the design of a dialogue management system, intended to address some of the problems which other research has revealed users to experience in using the standard UNIX® shell interface. This second phase resulted in the production of the QDOS system, which is both a simulation of part of the UNIX® file system and an implementation of the proposed dialogue management system. This software acts as the vehicle for all subsequent evaluative exercises constituting the third phase. This takes the form of an evaluation of the QDOS system and its theoretical underpinning, based on a two-condition experiment and a protocol analysis, involving a number of experimental subjects. This research provides an original application of the Gricean Cooperative Principle in human-computer interaction and a theoretical and practical demonstration of the validity of this endeavour. It also adduces an analysis of the UNIX® interface and its vagaries in terms of a principled and consistent set of criteria as well as identifying a significant class of dialogue breakdown, the circumstances and incidence of which cut across issues of interface style. </p...|$|R
40|$|About 40 years ago, {{or perhaps}} even earlier, logical systems started to emerge at a breath-taking pace almost every day. At the same time several unifying {{approaches}} have been proposed, that are also plural. Let me focus on two main families of unifying approaches based on two different ways to conceive Logic: 1. One approach takes up the traditional conception of logic, according to which a logical systems {{is determined by the}} set of <b>inferential</b> <b>rules.</b> 2. The other main approach that appeared around the 60 ties, conceives logical systems as the set of valid formulae they determine. Thus, according to the first approach, let us call it the inferentialist conception, we can unify different logical systems by changing some rules or properties of the inference relation. A common example is to distinguish classical logic from intuitionistic logic by distinguishing between a logical systems that allows more than one conclusion (classical logic) and one that do not (intuitionistic logic). In relation to the second approach, let me call it the formal semantics conception, proposes to unify logical systems by studying them under the background of the kind of truth-functional semantics presupposed by the determination of their valid formulae. For example, some early attempts to distinguish classical logic from intuitionistic logic, was to compare these logics by comparing them under the background of a truth-functional semantics. According to these perspective while classical logic is the set of valid formulae determined by Boolean-truth functions, the valid formulae of intuitionistic logic are determined by some specific form of a three-valued truth-function: so while the third excluded is valid under the Boolean background it is not valid under the three-valued one. Moreover, while the formal semantics approach is built on the traditional strict differentiation between semantics, syntax and pragmatics inherited from Charles Morris (1938, p. 3) – that I may recall was published in the first volume of the International Encylcopedia of Unified Science, inferentialism grew up out of a background that avoids keeping form and meaning apart (see Martin-Löf (1984, p. 2)), and the dialogical form of inferentialism, main subject of 1 The paper has been developed {{in the context of the}} researches for transversal research axis Argumentation (UMR 8163 : STL), the research project ADA at the MESHS-Nord-pas-de-Calais and the research projects: ANR-SÊMAINÔ (UMR 8163 : STL) ...|$|R
40|$|Counterfactuals are conjectures about {{alternatives}} to events {{that did not}} occur in the past; thoughts about what would have happened, had an alternative event oc-curred. Herein we show how counterfactual reasoning is modeled using Logic Programming (LP), particularly by benefitting from LP abduction and updating. The ap-proach is inspired by Pearl’s causal model of counter-factuals, where causal direction and conditional reason-ing are captured by <b>inferential</b> arrows of <b>rules</b> in logic programs. In this approach, LP abduction hypothesizes background conditions from given evidences or obser-vations, whereas LP updating helps frame these back-ground conditions as a counterfactual’s context. More-over, LP updating imposes causal interventions into the program, imposing minimal adjustments in the model through defeasible LP rules. We apply counterfactuals to computational morality resorting to this LP-based approach, and show their potential for specifying and querying morality issues, viz., to examine viewpoints on moral permissibility of actions through classic moral examples from literature. The results from this applica-tion have been validated on a prototype implementing the approach {{on top of an}} integrated LP abduction and updating system with tabling...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I discuss the {{problems}} associated with the epistemological task of arriving at basic logical knowledge. This is knowledge that the primitive rules of inference we use in deductive reasoning are correct. Knowledge of correctness, like all knowledge, is available to us either as the product of inference, or it is available non-inferentially. Success in the campaign to justify the correctness of these rules is mired by opposing views on how to do this properly. <b>Inferential</b> justifications of <b>rules</b> of inference, which are based on reasons, lead to regressive or circular results. Non-inferential justifications, based on something other than reasons, at first do not seem to fare any better: without a basis for these justifications, they appear arbitrary and unfounded. The works of Boghossian and Dummett who argue for an inferentialist approach, and Hale who supports non-inferentialism are carefully examined in this thesis. I conclude by finding superiority in Hale's suggestion that a particular set of basic logical constants are indispensable to deductive reasoning. I suggest that we endorse a principle which states that rules are not premises, and are therefore to be excluded from expression as statements in a deductive argument. I argue that the quality of being indispensable is sufficient for a basic rule of deduction to be countenanced as default-justified, and therefore need not be expressed in argument. By a rule's evading expression in argument, it avoids circular reasoning in deductive arguments about its own correctness. Another important outcome that emerges from my research is the finding that non-inferential knowledge is ontologically prior to the inferential sort. This is because plausible inferential knowledge of basic logical constants shall always be justified by circular reasoning that already assumes the correctness of the rule to be vindicated. This initial assumption is tantamount to non-inferential knowledge, and therefore this latter is more primitive-in fact the only primitive-species of basic logical knowledge...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionOne of {{the social}} factors {{influencing}} law-evading behavior is social distress or feelings of anomie. When society is in a chaotic situation, respecting the law is unenforceable. Previous research has shown how this situation contributes {{to a state of}} lawlessness. About the importance of this issue we can say that according to statistics many of road accidents in Iran stem from law-evading behavior and insufficient attention to traffic rules. Comparing the high rates of road accidents in Iran with other countries show that this is an important problem which has to be addressed from different aspects. That is why in this paper we focus on observance of traffic rules and its related factors. The main theories used to explain this phenomenon are Durkheim’s and Merton's anomie theories, status failure theory by Cohen, differential illegitimate opportunities theory by Cloward and Ohlin, control theory, structural theory of Opportunity, poverty and illegality by Robert Merton, Theory of rational choice and choice theory by Wilson and Herrnstein. Material and Methods Based on controlling research conditions, this study is a survey and cross-sectional study. The data was collected through close-question questionnaire after making sure that it is valid and reliable. Statistical population of this study includes the whole citizens of Tabriz who are over 18 years old and, have a driving license and also possess their own car. Sample size is 400 individuals. We used SPSS software for analyzing the data. Discussion of Results and Conclusions Descriptive findings show that: % 88 / 2 of the respondents are male and % 11 / 8 are female. The results of studying the ways of teaching traffic rule show that % 89 of respondents are taught by classis methods and % 41 by modern methods. When it comes to the type of driving license (first or second type), {{the results of the study}} show that % 85 / 3 of respondents had second-type license and % 14 / 8 of them had first-type license. When asked about their preferable system of controlling traffic, % 55 / 7 of respondents said they prefer electronic controlling system. In contrast, % 44 / 3 of respondents believed that control by traffic officers has been influential in observance of traffic <b>rules.</b> <b>Inferential</b> findings show that there is a significant and reverse correlation between feeling of anomie and rate of traffic rules observance. That is, when the feeling of anomie increases, the rate of traffic rules observance decreases and vice versa. Findings of also show that there is significant correlation between probability of penalty and rate of traffic rules observance: when penalty is more probable, drivers tend to be more careful about traffic rules. Results of regression analysis show that % 66 of changes in “observance of traffic rules” variable is explained by feeling of anomie and probability of penalty as independent variables. As applied recommendations, we can say that it is necessary for the official authorities to try to prepare a trustable atmosphere and legitimate rules and norms for people as not only does it lead to a low level of anomie, but people also accept the rules and norms warmly. In this situation, they accept police as a legitimate and legal institution, whose job is to protect people, whose orders must be obeyed as part of the law.
