Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{shows up}} in Scranton after Robert California (James Spader) allows her to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> there. She is invited to take an open desk, and she takes Andy's manager desk, as he is absent. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) says she cannot take Andy's job, but Robert is {{interested}} in her spontaneous behavior. As acting manager, Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews. Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees. To counter this, Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot, and eventually, {{he and the other}} employees relent, except for Jim. When it is Jim's turn, Jim still refuses. Everyone in the office, except for Jim and his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), applaud her. Nellie promptly begins rearranging the office.|$|E

Three of Moore's four children, who lived with her, {{had been removed from}} the house earlier in the year and placed in foster care by the city's Administration for Children's Services (ACS). They had investigated and confirmed reports that the children had been neglected, missing school and staying at home by themselves during some of Moore's frequent absences.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{traditional}} for each Kent student to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> {{while they are}} at school.This tradition {{dates back to the}} early days of the school when it was mainly self-sufficient. These are not jobs in the typical sense but are rather different duties and obligations that each student will have. Some jobs are very basic, such as washing tables after dinner or keeping a common room neat. Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs are different than when they were originally created.|$|E

25|$|For further {{education}} {{there are two}} tertiary institutes and two national universities. The first ones are Instituto Superior Juan XXIII, (probably linked to the future UNISAL (standing for Universidad Salesiana) of the Salesians) and Instituto Avanza (tertiary institute of humanities). National Universities are Facultad Regional Bahía Blanca Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, devoted mainly to exact sciences and intended for students who do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for making a living, with formal activities in the evening; and Universidad Nacional del Sur (National University of the South), founded in January 1956. This last one has associated internationally known institutes of research in biological, biochemical and technological sciences such as INIBIB and Instituto de Oceanografia, among others. Both national universities are free of tuition fees for all students.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has {{an annual}} quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the Pacific Access Category, as {{announced}} in 2001. The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criteria {{is that the}} principal applicant must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> offer from a New Zealand employer. Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands. Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian Pacific Seasonal Worker Program, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|In England, by the 1890s, {{a long-standing}} Rugby Football Union ban on {{professional}} players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were {{working class and}} {{could not afford to}} take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> outside sport.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged {{them to make}} a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls and sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreel of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again.|$|E

500|$|Accordingly, the Germans cut theatrics {{from their}} goal celebrations; arms were raised {{but there was}} no jumping or {{screaming}} after scoring. Coach Joachim Löw stated his team had [...] "a clear, persistent game-plan", and as they realised Brazil were [...] "cracking up", they took advantage as in contrast to the Brazilians' nervousness the German players were [...] "extremely cool". Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Wilding joined the Royal Marines on advice of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines {{for just a few}} days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist. At the end of October he joined the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division in the battlefields of northern France where he had thirty men, three guns and armoured cars under his command. After a week's leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote [...] "For really the first time in seven and a half months I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> on hand which is likely to end in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell.
