5|$|It was to {{have been}} a five-week race, from 1 June to 5 July, with an <b>entry</b> <b>fee</b> of 20 francs. These {{conditions}} attracted very few cyclists: one week before the race was due to start, only 15 competitors had signed up. Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the <b>entry</b> <b>fee</b> to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification. After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 actually started the race.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the PGA Tour and Web.Com Tour, {{for which}} prize funds are {{provided}} by sponsors, {{the bulk of the}} prize fund paid out in SwingThought Tour events comes from player <b>entry</b> <b>fees.</b> Like poker tournaments, players are competing to win back their <b>entry</b> <b>fees</b> (and the <b>entry</b> <b>fees</b> from others). However, thanks in part to sponsorship, the SwingThought Tour players actually play for over 100% of their <b>entry</b> <b>fees</b> in some events, while other developmental tours typically pay back only 65%-90% of <b>entry</b> <b>fees.</b> Additional purse bonuses and prize related offerings are typical on the SwingThought TOUR.|$|R

5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his <b>entry</b> <b>fee,</b> which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new <b>entry</b> <b>fee</b> for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E
