50|$|The <b>Formidables</b> {{were similar}} in {{appearance}} to and had the same armament as the Majestic and Canopus classes that preceded them.

She departed three days later, bound for Karavia Bay, New Britain, where she loaded 1,254 men of the Indian Army and continued on to Singapore where she loaded Indian ex-PoWs before delivering them to Bombay. There <b>Formidable</b> loaded an Indian Army infantry battalion for transport to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to maintain law and order until Dutch colonial troops could take over.
