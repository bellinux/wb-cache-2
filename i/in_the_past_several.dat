5|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{geomagnetic}} field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, {{as shown by the}} record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E
5|$|In his {{withdrawal}} {{instructions for}} the 7th Cavalry, Colonel Cecil Nist, the regimental commander, ordered the 2nd Battalion to disengage from the North Koreans to its front and attack to its rear to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment.

5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter {{at a distance of}} about 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by the}} past influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>several</b> mean-motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe's orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe's orbit.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E
