The model is tested via an online survey of 811 consumers of four categories of mobile <b>data</b> <b>services</b> (i. e., communications, information content, entertainment, and commercial transactions) associated with different usage contexts.

40|$|Objective: The study {{investigated}} veterinary medicine librarians’ experience with {{and perceptions of}} research <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> Many academic libraries have begun to offer research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> in response to researchers’ increased need for data management support. To date, such services have typically been generic, rather than discipline-specific, {{to appeal to a}} wide variety of researchers. Methods: An online survey was deployed to identify trends regarding research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> in veterinary medicine libraries. Participants were identified from a list of contacts from the MLA Veterinary Medical Libraries Section. Results: Although many respondents indicated that they have a professional interest in research <b>data</b> <b>services,</b> the majority of veterinary medicine librarians only rarely or occasionally provide data management support as part of their regular job responsibilities. There was little consensus as to whether research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> should be core to a library’s mission despite their perceived importance to the advancement of veterinary research. Furthermore, most respondents stated that research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> are just as or somewhat less important than the other services that they provide and feel only slightly or somewhat prepared to offer such services. Conclusions: Lacking a standard definition of ‘‘research data’’ and a common understanding of precisely what research <b>data</b> <b>services</b> encompass, it is difficult for veterinary medicine librarians and libraries to define and understand their roles in research <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> Nonetheless, they appear to have an interest in learning more about and providing research <b>data</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

The collection originated during the First World War, when the museum acquired works that it had itself commissioned, [...] as well as works commissioned by the Ministry of Information's British War Memorials Committee. As early as 1920 the {{art collection}} held over 3,000 works and included pieces by John Singer Sargent, Wyndham Lewis, John Nash and Christopher Nevinson. Notable First World War works include Sargent's Gassed and other works commissioned for an, unbuilt, Hall of Remembrance. The collection expanded again after the Second World War, receiving thousands of works sponsored by the Ministry of Information's War Artists' Advisory Committee. In 1972 the museum established the Artistic Records Committee (since renamed the Art Commissions Committee) to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. Commissioned artists include Ken Howard, Linda Kitson, John Keane, Peter Howson, Steve McQueen (see Queen and Country) and Langlands & Bell, responding to conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. The collection also includes over twenty thousand items of publicity material such as posters, postcards, and proclamations from both world wars, and more recent material such as posters issued by anti-war organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stop the War Coalition. The museum's collection is represented in digital resources such as the Visual Arts <b>Data</b> <b>Service</b> (VADS), and Google Art Project.
