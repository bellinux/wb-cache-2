5|$|Groves had {{previously}} been nominated for the Distinguished Service Medal {{for his work on}} the Pentagon, but to avoid drawing attention to the Manhattan Project, it had not been awarded at the time. After the war, the Decorations Board decided to change it to a Legion of Merit. In recognition of his work on the project, the Belgian <b>government</b> <b>made</b> him a Commander of the Order of the Crown and the British <b>government</b> <b>made</b> him an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the <b>government</b> <b>made</b> a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Madras State Aid to Industries Act was passed. Through this act, the <b>government</b> <b>made</b> it a {{state policy}} to advance loans to {{developing}} industries. It received less {{opposition in the}} assembly. This eventually became Madras Act V of 1923.|$|E
50|$|<b>Governments</b> <b>made</b> {{efforts to}} exist even after an apocalyptic nuclear attack, {{something}} called continuity of government. Many city halls built Emergency Operation Centers in their basements.|$|R

5|$|In 1954 James {{wrote an}} account of the operation, {{entitled}} I Was Monty's Double (published in the United States as The Counterfeit General). The British <b>government</b> <b>made</b> no attempt to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name. James starred, both as himself and Montgomery, alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{majority}} Labor <b>government</b> <b>made</b> sweeping {{changes to the}} education system, shutting down 23 schools across the territory. These {{were made in the}} face of sustained public opposition, and since then, there have been campaigns from opposition parties and the community to re-open some of them. This included the 2008 election, where it was a major topic.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's <b>government</b> <b>made</b> a unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.|$|E

5|$|With the {{suspension}} of responsible government the dominion was administered by the Commission of Government, from 1934 to 1949. It was a body of seven appointed by the British <b>government,</b> <b>made</b> up of three British officials, three Newfoundlanders, and chaired by the Governor of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world <b>government</b> <b>made</b> up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local <b>government</b> <b>made</b> requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
50|$|Blair {{sought to}} modernise Britain's public services, {{encourage}} enterprise and innovation in its {{private sector and}} keep its economy open to international commerce. Under his premiership, British <b>governments</b> <b>made</b> major changes to the British constitution by legislation that transferred decision-making to devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|R

5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian <b>government</b> <b>made</b> {{mandatory}} the use {{of ethanol}} blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor <b>government</b> <b>made</b> a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian <b>government</b> <b>made</b> {{it publicly}} known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at Chequers, the official country {{residence of the}} British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.|$|E
50|$|The Congress stood firm on its {{fundamental}} {{promises and}} delivered a Constitution that abolished untouchability and {{discrimination based on}} caste, religion or gender. Primary education was made a right, and Congress <b>governments</b> <b>made</b> the zamindar system illegal, created minimum wages and authorized the right to strike and form labor unions.|$|R

5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher <b>government</b> <b>made</b> another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French <b>government</b> <b>made</b> an {{official}} investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|In 802, Harun and {{the most}} {{powerful}} officials of the Abbasid <b>government</b> <b>made</b> the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards {{the extent of the}} autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.|$|E

5|$|In August, a bill {{authorizing the}} Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts {{was passed by}} the Chamber of Deputies seventy-two to thirteen. Three months later, it was {{defeated}} in the Senate after they approved an arbitration treaty and the <b>government</b> <b>made</b> a last-ditch offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed. The Brazilian government declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money (£14,000,000) could be better spent {{in other areas of the}} government.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales <b>government</b> <b>made</b> a {{proclamation}} which transferred {{control of}} the Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The {{assassination}} {{precipitated the}} July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary {{to issue an}} ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian <b>government</b> <b>made</b> the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers {{in order to prevent}} the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I.|$|E
