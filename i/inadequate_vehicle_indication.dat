40|$|This chapter {{calls for}} {{rethinking}} {{about the rights}} base of early childhood education. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (UNICEF 1989) {{has been seen as}} an important foundation internationally for early childhood education practise. In this paper, I argue that whilst the UNCRC (1989) still serves its aspirational purpose, it is an <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicle</b> for enacting early childhood education in the twenty-first century given the pressing challenges of sustainability. The UNCRC emerged from an individual rights perspective, and despite attempts to broaden the rights agenda towards greater child participation and engagement, these approaches offer an inadequate response to global sustainability concerns. In this chapter, I propose a five dimensional approach to rights that acknowledges the fundamental rights of children as espoused in the UNCRC and the call for agentic rights as advocated more recently by early childhood academics and practitioners. Additionally, however, discussion of collective rights, intergenerational rights and bio/ecocentic rights are forwarded, offering a expanded way to think about rights with implications for how early childhood education is practised and researched. ...|$|R

The scheme comprises two main steps performed progressively- vehicle extraction and motion status classification. The step for vehicle extraction {{is intended to}} detect and delineate single vehicle instances as accurate and complete as possible, while the step for motion status classification takes advantage of shape artefacts defined for moving vehicle model, to classify the extracted vehicle point sets based on parameterized boundary features, which are sufficiently good to describe the vehicle shape. To accomplish the tasks, a hybrid strategy integrating context-guided method with 3 -d segmentation based approach is applied for vehicle extraction. Then, a binary classification method using Lie group based distance is adopted to determine the vehicle motion status. However, the vehicle velocity cannot be derived at this stage due to unknown true size of vehicle. We illustrate the <b>vehicle</b> motion <b>indication</b> scheme by two examples of real data and summarize the performance by accessing the results with respect to reference data manually acquired, through which the feasibility and high potential of airborne LiDAR for urban traffic analysis are verified. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAt signalized crosswalks, {{pedestrian}} {{clearance time}} is a key design parameter for ensuring safe pedestrian crossing. It is generally defined as the time required by pedestrians who enter crosswalks {{at the end of}} the green indication to complete crossing before conflicting vehicular traffic movements are released. In Japan, pedestrian green indications are followed by pedestrian flashing green (PFG) indications during which time pedestrians are not allowed to start crossing and those in the crosswalk have to finish crossing to either side of the crosswalk; as such, some pedestrians are expected to return to the side they came from. Therefore, PFG intervals are designed to be shorter than the necessary clearance time. Instead, relatively longer red buffer intervals (BI) are provided between the end of the PFG and the succeeding <b>vehicle</b> green <b>indication.</b> This study clarifies the differences between signal setting concepts in various countries and analyses pedestrian clearing behaviors under the Japanese signal control system. Empirical analyses show that the current PFG and BI settings in Japan are shorter than the necessary clearance time and the settings in the US and Germany. As a result, most observed pedestrians who started crossing after the onset of PFG cannot finish crossing before its end and cannot even finish before the succeeding <b>vehicle</b> green <b>indication...</b>|$|R

The sample for questionnaire surveys comprised all the 601 organised informal sector enterprises in Monomotapa high density suburb, Shamrock Park high density suburb, Mkoba high density Suburb, Ascot high Density Suburb, Kudzanai market and Kombayi market. Focus group discussions and interviews with key informants were arranged {{for the purposes of}} assessing solid waste management needs and priorities in the informal sector of Gweru and how to improve the waste management system. The main challenges in implementing environmentally sound waste management strategies included operational and logistical constraints such as <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicles</b> and equipment resulting in erratic collection of waste, obsolete and unsuitable equipment, unqualified personnel, poorly paid and untrained workers. These challenges were attributed to the limited funding for waste management by the waste authorities in the City Council. The institutional and legislative constraints included lack of enforcement of environmental legislation, lack of environmental education, uncontrolled waste dumping and negative public attitudes on waste management and waste work itself. Among the suggested strategies for managing waste, the study recommends that of shared responsibility in waste management among the city council, the enterprise operators and the Environmental Management Agency...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point, the aspiration of Māori to be self-determining {{and to have}} this authority recognised and engaged in Treaty partnerships with the Crown in its own evolving terms. This prospect is examined {{in relation to the}} tertiary education environment, with a particular focus on the possibilities that kaupapa Māori spaces and structures presently being developed at various universities offer to advancing just forms of Treaty partnership. Its methodological journey to posit how Treaty partnerships might be conceived of and made possible draws on concepts from kaupapa Māori theory, supported by deconstructive insights as both seek to question and transform totalising colonial bicultural identities and discourses of sovereignty. Current political and legal bicultural arrangements are examined and critiqued as <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicles</b> through which partnership might be advanced as they do not sufficiently question the sovereign position of the state. Significantly, this failure allows a reconsideration of the very meaning of partnership, bringing forth the possibility of recognition being given to both authoritative partners to Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi, Māori and the Crown. Through the lines of critical questioning, consideration is given to the structural arrangements, relational resources and ethical principles that might rejuvenate the notion of partnership. Central to the thesis is the notion that Treaty partnerships become possible by and through each partner recognising and engaging with the limits of their own authority to determine the nature and terms of partnership...|$|R
30|$|Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANET) provide local vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications {{to support}} intelligent transportations systems (ITS) applications. Example applications are emergency electronic brake lights, slow <b>vehicle</b> <b>indication,</b> wrong way driver warning, stationary vehicle warning, lane change assistance, etc. The technology used to enable such ad hoc networking is called IEEE 802.11 p [1]. This is {{an amendment to}} the IEEE 802.11 standard that contains several enhancements to improve performance under vehicular conditions. Examples are an increased output power, dedicated channel, and reduced channel bandwidth to account for the influence of Doppler spread. In contrast with other ad hoc networking use cases, VANET communication in general does not focus on unicast transmissions. Instead, the emphasis is put on the dissemination of information to all nodes located in a certain region. Typically, this functionality is achieved by combining media access control (MAC) level broadcasting with geographic-aware forwarding schemes on the networking layer. In general, two different kinds of information messages are used: cooperative awareness messages (CAM) [2] and decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM) [3]. The former is utilized to continuously exchange status information such as location, heading, and speed with the other vehicles in the immediate environment. Hence, CAM beacons are restricted to single-hop broadcasts. The latter is applied when some specific piece of information regarding the environment, e.g., tail of traffic jam, slippery spot, obstacle on the road, etc. is to be communicated to all vehicles within a given area. Therefore, DENM messages are multi-hop broadcasted in the VANET.|$|R

40|$|Background: Extended Programme on Immunization {{performance}} {{is among the}} four main indicators selected for general budget support to the health sector. The declining trend in performance of the immunization program is a major concern, routine immunization coverage in Tanzania declined from 94 % in 2004 to 85 % in 2009 (MOHSW, EPI REVIEW 2010) Vaccination is one method that has been proven effective in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases. However to be effective a number of elements in a vaccination program need to be implemented properly, including cold chain management, vaccine management, logistic management and waste management. Failure to properly implement these can reduce the level of protection that is expected from a vaccination program. Objectives The study examined current distribution system of vaccines from second level which is Regional stores, third level which is District stores to fourth level which is health facility and storage practices. Methodology It was a cross-sectional survey, staff responsible for vaccine distribution system and storage were interviewed about their knowledge and practices of vaccine distribution, handling and storage. Data collection started in April to 16 th June 2012. Data was from 40 selected healthcare facilities and 5 warehouses in Coast region based on geographic representation. Vaccine storage conditions were also assessed and determined at different levels. Availability of 6 tracer vaccines for the past 10 months was assessed and this aided in assessing inventory management and stock control of vaccines at the health facilities. Results Availability of 6 tracer vaccines {{during the time of}} survey was high at regional vaccine store (100 %), followed by district vaccine stores (93. 3 %) and low at healthcare facilities (82 %). Stocks out duration were more at healthcare facilities level (72 days) than district vaccine stores (33 days). Most of the parameters of storage conditions were not met by the XIII facilities. Knowledge level of healthcare givers was inadequate. The study reveals that all personnel involved in handling and storage of vaccines were non pharmaceutical personnel. Conclusions & recommendations: Managing effective distribution system at public health facilities is associated with many challenges/problems including <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicles</b> for distribution especially in lower level, poor storage conditions, unreliable electricity and lack/delay of gas, no involvement of pharmaceutical personnel in program, no quantification at low facility level and lack of on job training.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 26 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2007 "The challenges of implementing policy?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT:Heavy vehicle overloading and road safety continue to be major problems on South African roads despite efforts at more effective enforcement by the road and traffic authorities. Overloading causes premature road deterioration and, together with <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicle</b> maintenance, driver fatigue and poor driver health, contributes significantly to South Africa’s poor road safety record. This paper describes the most recent developments of an initiative to introduce meaningful self-regulation in the heavy vehicle transport industry through a Road Transport Management System (RTMS) {{with the aim of}} contributing to the road authorities’ efforts to address the above problems. During 2003 a heavy vehicle accreditation scheme was developed and implemented in the forestry industry in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Based on an Australian model, the scheme seeks to promote compliance with standards in the areas of load control and securement, vehicle maintenance and driver wellness. In line with the Department of Transport’s National Overload Control Strategy, its aim is to encourage heavy vehicle operators, consignees and consignors to take more responsibility for ensuring that their loads are transported legally. Although the pilot project was initiated in forestry, the project has been executed keeping the broader heavy vehicle transport industry in mind. The success of the project in forestry resulted in similar initiatives commencing in other industries including pulp, paper and board, bitumen, coal, sugar and aggregate and sand. A national steering committee was established to co-ordinate the various initiatives and a strategy document developed. As part of this strategy, Standards SA of the SABS was approached to develop national standards for transport operators, consignors and consignees using the documentation developed for the forestry industry as a starting point. This process has commenced with the constituting of STANSA TC 181 B: Road Transport Management Systems. Although this is essentially a private sector initiative, since the commencement of the project in forestry, there has been strong support and involvement from government, including the national Department of Transport, the SA National Roads Agency, various provincial road authorities and the Department of Trade and Industry.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{resonant}} internal tide motion. One common linear inviscid model represents the motion {{in terms of a}} two dimensional stream function satisfying a standard second order hyperbolic equation. This model is examined in detail and it is shown that existing solution techniques can be extended and unified with the classical theory of a single complex variable. This results in a number of new theoretical devices for the solution of the model, including c-conformal mapping - a mapping procedure that shares many of the traits of classical conformal mapping, and c-analytic continuation - a procedure for extending the domain of a solution analogous to standard analytic continuation. These techniques are applied to a study of the model on closed basins. A crucial distinction relating to the geometry of the corners of the basin is noted, and the importance of energy sources and sinks is recognized. The analysis is found both to support the conjectures of other researchers that the existence of resonant motion may be predicted through an analysis of the characteristic coordinates of the inviscid model, and to demonstrate that the inviscid model is an <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the study of internal tides on basin topographies. A viscous form of the linear model is then discussed and a number of numerical solution techniques suitable for basin topographies are devised. The first of these is a straightforward application of standard collocation methods, but is found to be computationally expensive. A simpler, more efficient family of techniques based on the theory of c-analytic continuation is then derived. These methods are seen to be a natural extension of a Fourier series technique successfully employed by other authors. The predictions of the linear models are then compared with the results of laboratory experiments. Resonance effects are seen {{to play a major role}} in determining the motion of the fluid. However, the strongly resonant motions predicted by the linear models are not observed, and, in general, the agreement between model and data is poor. This is attributed to both the sensitivity of the problem and the difficulty associated with modelling the external forcing. The large amplitude strongly resonant motions predicted by the linear models prompt a study of nonlinear internal tide dynamics. A nonlinear model based on the Navier Stokes equations is considered, and numerical solutions are obtained via finite differences. These solutions show that for strongly resonant motion the "Rigid Lid" approximation commonly imposed at the free surface is inadequate and must be replaced with a more accurate nonlinear boundary condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of Western Australia’s economy, society and environment is fundamentally affected by industrial metabolism and associated induced resource flows. Several indicators of Australia’s resource economy suggest that massive dematerialisation, decarbonisation, and detoxification of industrial material flows {{will need to}} begin {{in the near future}} if the resource economy is to become sustainable in the longer term. The paper examines industrial ecology in its potential to inform and deliver the necessary restructuring of Australia’s industrial metabolism along a sustainable trajectory of development. In this sense, the Kwinana industrial area in Western Australia is recognised as an internationally significant example of industrial symbioses. Contributions to industrial efficiency have occurred through the evolutionary development of a complex resource exchange network involving at least 28 heavy industries in the Kwinana industrial strip. The Kwinana resource exchange network is compared with a well documented though smaller example of industrial symbioses involving 8 industries in Kalundborg, Denmark. Industrial ecology in its manifestation as industrial synergy is critiqued in its capacity to provide a platform for sustainable industrial development. The establishment of resource exchange networks among industrial firms has contributed significantly to energy and resource efficiency at the industrial firm or estate level, however the Jevons’ Paradox informs that while component efficiency may be a characteristic of a sustainable materials economy, it does not provide a means to get there. Industrial synergy in this sense may in fact promote unsustainable path dependant development, and is an <b>inadequate</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the delivery of industrial sustainability outcomes at the broader level of industrial metabolism. Demand-side management at various stages of the industrial materials economy is briefly explored as a policy option addressing overall system efficiency while also driving the desirable efficiency of industrial metabolic components such as the industrial firm. In advocating industrial symbioses, the ecological metaphor employed by industrial ecologists is largely informed by a reductionist and mechanistic understanding of isolated components of natural systems. This paper explores a deeper more holistic understanding of the organisation and development of ecological systems, drawing particularly from the self-organising system models described by Gaian ecology. The ecological metaphor in this reviewed and expanded sense is applied to the organisational system dynamics of industrial economics and development institutions, informing a potentially more robust model for the sustainable development of industrial systems. The region of Kwinana -Rockingham is referred to as a significant evolving example of institutional and organisational ecology among industrial development stakeholders. Cooperation, information transfer and capacity building between industry, community, and the public sector represents a more powerful articulation of industrial ecology, and potentially provides a powerful vehicle for the delivery of industrial sustainability outcomes on a regional and regulatory level. A collaborative and ecological industrial development process allowing broad participation and emphasising the development of human capital is suggested as a significant and pragmatic contribution to the broader industrial sustainability agenda...|$|R

The next stage will involve space stations in low earth orbit with limited self-sufficiency, characterized by closed ecological environments, space-generated power, and perhaps the first use of space materials. The third phase would include manned geosynchronous space-station activity and a return to lunar operations. Easier access to space will encourage the use of more complex, maintenance-requiring satellites than those currently used. More advanced space systems could perform a wide range of public services such as electronic mail, personal and police communication, disaster control, earthquake detection/prediction, water availability <b>indication,</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed control, and burglar alarm/intrusion detection. Certain products, including integrated-circuit chips and some enzymes, can be processed to a higher degree of purity in space and might eventually be manufactured there. Hardware including dishes, booms, and planar surfaces necessary for advanced space systems and their development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{study the}} extent and {{execution}} of redundant processes during inpatient transfers to Radiology, {{and their impact on}} errors during the transfer process; to explore the use of causal and reliability analyses for modelling error detection and redundancy in the transfer process; and to provide guidance on potential system improvements. Methods A prospective observational study at a metropolitan teaching hospital. 101 patient transfers to Radiology were observed over a 6 -month period, and errors in patient transfer process were recorded. Fault Tree Analysis was used to model error paths and identify redundant steps. Reliability Analysis was used to quantify system reliability. Results 420 errors were noted, an average of four errors per transfer. No incidents of patient harm were recorded. Inadequate handover was the most common error (43. 1 %), followed by failure to perform patient identification checks (41. 9 %), patient inadequately prepared for transfer (7. 4 %), inadequate infection control precautions (2. 9 %), inadequate clinical escort (2. 1 %), <b>inadequate</b> transport <b>vehicle</b> (2. 1 %) and equipment failure (0. 2 %). Four redundant steps for communicating patients' infectious status were identified (reliability= 0. 07, 0. 37, 0. 26, 0. 31). Collectively, these yielded a system reliability of 0. 7. The low reliability of each individual step was due to its low rate of execution. Conclusions Analysis of the transfer process revealed a number of redundancies that safeguard against transfer errors. However, they were relatively ineffective in preventing errors, due to the poor compliance rate. Thus, the authors advocate increasing compliance to existing redundant processes as an improvement strategy, before investing resources on new processes. 7 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|T-55AM was a 1980s {{modernization}} {{of the basic}} T-55 tank. The 144 T-55AM tanks received Czechoslovak-produced [...] "Kladivo" [...] fire control system, thermal sleeve on gun, new mounting for 12,7mm HMG, a laser rangefinder, mounted over the barrel, inside a large rectangular armoured box. Hungarian tanks fitted with BDD add-on armour blocks on the turret front-sides area and glacis (known as the [...] "horse-shoes" [...] or the [...] "Brezhnev's eyebrow" [...] armour). The BDD armour panels consist of armoured steel boxes filled with Penpolyurethane and thin HHS steel plates. The BDD semi-reactive armor adding 120mm of protection against APDS and 200-250mm of protection against HEAT ammunition, thus these tanks had similar protection as early versions of T-72 (similary to the Czech AM2s). The type was partly unsuccessful due to the unreliable Kladico FCS and <b>inadequate</b> mobility (Hungarian <b>vehicles</b> never received new engines). T-55AM tanks were withdrawn from service {{during the early years}} of the 2000s (decade), some scrapped, some mothballed, leaving only a handful of T-72B and T-72M vehicles in active Hungarian army service.|$|R
40|$|The purpose fo {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} and describe the documented management of head injured patients during the first 24 hours as implemented at the Princess Marina Hospital, Gaborone (Botswana). Particular attention was paid to the documented interventions carried out by nurses and medical doctors during the first 24 hours. A survey research design using a chekclist to obtain data was utilized. The method of data collection was by record review. The population for this research comprised all head injured patients admitted to the Princess Marina Hospital over a one year period from 1. 1. 1997 to 31. 12. 1997. A preliminary record review indicated that a total of 240 patients have been treated from January 1997 to December 1991 The sample (n = 126) consisted of one hundred and twenty-six records of head injured patients, who were received in the accident and emergency unit and admitted in different wards for m anagem ent during the first 24 hours. The setting of this research was the Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. A pilot study was undertaken at the sam e hospital. Data was analysed by use of a computer. Descriptive statistics were used. The study revealed that documentation of time of injury, arrival time and time of transfer to the wards was <b>inadequate.</b> Motor <b>vehicle</b> accidents are the commonest causes of injury and assault is the second commonest. Though poor documentation is noted at som e stages, adequate care appears to have been given to patients in the opinion of the researcher. The prescription and interventions for head injured patients were found to be appropriate. There was poor documentation on cervical spine c o n tro l. Blood g ases were not assessed in 98...|$|R
40|$|Approved for Public ReleaseThe {{subject of}} this Publications Report is {{electronic}} preparation and distribution of materials. I expect that most of our readers are now familiar with the recent special issue of IEEE Transactions on Education, {{which seems to have}} stimulated a considerable level of interest, both within and outside IEEE. To many ACES members, the immediate vision evoked when this topic arises for discussion is the dissemination of entire Journal and Newsletter issues to the ACES membership by electronic means. That is certainly part of the consideration, but there are numerous other preliminary mechanics which must be addressed and mastered prior to dealing with the matter of total document delivery by an electronic <b>vehicle.</b> The public <b>indications</b> from IEEE all point to the year 2000 as their target for an effective, comprehensive implementation of electronic methods; present experiments are apparently just that. To facilitate a corresponding start along the learning curve for ACES Publications, it appears appropriate that we should also begin our own experimentation during 1997...|$|R
