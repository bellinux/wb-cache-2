5000|$|Several car {{manufacturers}} referenced the Balance ad {{in subsequent}} commercials. [...] In separate instances, Nissan and BMW mentioned the <b>champagne</b> <b>glasses</b> test in their ads. The Nissan ads, {{designed for the}} debut of the Nissan Altima in 1993, duplicated the Lexus displays of <b>champagne</b> <b>glasses</b> and ball bearings. [...] Nissan then stacked <b>champagne</b> <b>glasses</b> {{on the hood of}} its less-expensive Altima, showing a similar level of precision. The BMW ads mocked the <b>champagne</b> <b>glasses</b> test as an unnecessary indicator of performance. In the late 1990s, Lexus added advertisements that focused on fun and entertainment, in addition to engineering precision. The earlier ads were seen as a highly rational appeal. In 2006, Lexus referenced Balance with a new ad for the fourth-generation Lexus LS 460. Titled Pyramid, the ad depicted a driver parking a car between two stacks of <b>champagne</b> <b>glasses</b> using the Advanced Parking Guidance System, a new Lexus automatic parking feature.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s he pioneered {{the concept of}} the in-room {{swimming}} pool. Wilkins later {{came up with the idea}} of a <b>champagne</b> <b>glass</b> bathtub, which debuted in 1983. It was a 7-foot-high Plexiglas whirlpool bath shaped like a long-stemmed <b>champagne</b> <b>glass,</b> large enough to accommodate two adults. [...] Wilkins said, [...] "I went to a Caesars board meeting and there I was, sitting around the table with these high-powered guys from Las Vegas. I pulled out a picture of a <b>champagne</b> <b>glass</b> and they looked at me like I was nuts." [...] He said that it cost about $150,000 to design and make the molds for the <b>champagne</b> <b>glass</b> tubs. Speck Plastics in Wind Gap, Pennsylvania, manufactured the tubs for about $15,000 each.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} of Lindsay was based partially on Lord Burghley, a significant {{figure in the}} history of British athletics.
