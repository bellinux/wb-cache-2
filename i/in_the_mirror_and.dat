25|$|The McGurk {{effect can}} be {{observed}} when the listener is also the speaker or articulator. While looking at oneself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk {{effect can be}} observed. In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli softly while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk effect can still be seen, although it is weaker.|$|E
25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>and</b> yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|E

25|$|In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, {{observed}} by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene {{appears to be}} reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror)</b> <b>and,</b> at the same time, looks straight out at us.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that self-recognition was absent from animals without a neocortex, and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of self-recognition in corvids reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less magpies are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> mark test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness. However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals. For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.|$|E

500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice.

She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!"

The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest."

It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all of her back while sitting {{on the floor next to}} a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing up in front of a microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.|$|E
