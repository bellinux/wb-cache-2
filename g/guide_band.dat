40|$|We {{consider}} discrete Schrödinger operators with periodic potentials on periodic graphs perturbed by guided non-positive potentials, {{which are}} periodic in some directions and finitely supported in other ones. The {{spectrum of the}} unperturbed operator is a union of {{a finite number of}} non-degenerate bands and eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity. We show that the spectrum of the perturbed operator consists of the unperturbed one plus the additional guided spectrum, which is a union of a finite number of bands. We estimate the position of the <b>guided</b> <b>bands</b> and their length in terms of graph geometric parameters. We also determine the asymptotics of the <b>guided</b> <b>bands</b> for large <b>guided</b> potentials.

We show that the spectrum of the perturbed Laplacian consists of the unperturbed one plus the additional so-called guided spectrum which is a union of a finite number of bands.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{microorganisms}} {{to adhere to}} abiotic surfaces and the potentialities of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy have been exploited to study protonation and heavy metal binding events onto bacterial surfaces. This work represents the first attempt to apply on bacteria the recently developed method known as perfusion-induced ATR-FTIR difference spectroscopy. (1, 2) Such a technique allows measurement of even slight changes in the infrared spectrum of the sample, deposited as a thin layer on an ATR crystal, while an aqueous solution is perfused over its surface. Solutions at different pH {{have been used for}} inducing protonation/deprotonation of functional groups lying on the surface of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells, chosen as a model system. The interaction of Ni 2 + with surface protonable groups of this microorganism has been investigated with a double-difference approach exploiting competition between nickel cations and protons. Protonation-induced difference spectra of simple model compounds have been acquired to <b>guide</b> <b>band</b> assignment in bacterial spectra, thus allowing identification of major components involved in proton uptake and metal binding. The data collected reveal that carboxylate moieties on the bacterial surface of R. sphaeroides play a role in extracellular biosorption of Ni 2 +, establishing with this ion relatively weak coordinative bonds...|$|E

40|$|We present TE {{transmission}} measurements of photonic crystal waveguides with high hole radius to period ratio r/¿ = 0. 388.

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis {{is the study of}} {{photonic}} crystal waveguides that incorporate discontinuities or structural fabrication-induced variations. For the numerical study of these devices the mode matching (MM) method is proposed. The comparison of the MM method with the couple mode theory (CMT) showed that the CMT can provide only a first approximation to the perturbation-induced scattering in photonic crystal waveguides. Additionally it was investigated the propagation of optical pulses in photonic crystal waveguides {{near the edge of the}} <b>guided</b> <b>band,</b> where the group velocity of the pulse is minimized...|$|R

We achieved nearly full transmission throughout the <b>guiding</b> <b>band</b> of the periodic coupled cavities within the photonic band gap. The tight-binding (TB) parameter K is determined from experimental results, and the dispersion relation, group velocity and photon lifetime corresponding to the coupled-cavity structures are analyzed within the TB approximation.
