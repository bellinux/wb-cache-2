Two months later, following the Nazi Machtergreifung, Adolf Hitler suppressed the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and threw thousands of party members in jail. Hu Lanqi was arrested and imprisoned for three months. When the news reached China, Soong Ching-ling and the prominent writer Lu Xun formally petitioned the German consulate in Shanghai and secured her release. She was deported to France and moved to England soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1927, a {{much more}} {{politically}} active Modotti (she joined the Mexican <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> that year) found her focus shifting and more of her work becoming politically motivated.

5000|$|Fassbinder's film {{criticizes the}} bloodthirst of the 1970s German media {{in a similar}} manner to The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (directed by Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta). However, Fassbinder's film goes further by criticizing the {{overwhelming}} selfishness present in contemporary society. Nearly everyone who Mother Küsters encounters is self-serving and unconcerned with comforting her. Fassbinder also clearly criticizes the small <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> moderation and [...] "armchair activism".|$|R
50|$|The British, French, and <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>parties,</b> all {{originally}} war supporters, {{abandoned their}} anti-Fascist crusades, demanded peace, and denounced Allied governments. The CPUSA turned {{the focus of}} its public activities from anti-fascism to advocating peace, not only opposing military preparations but also condemning those opposed to Hitler. The CPUSA attacked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French leader Édouard Daladier, but did not at first attack President Roosevelt, reasoning that this could devastate American Communism, blaming instead Roosevelt's advisors.|$|R
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Wessel soon {{impressed}} Goebbels, and in January 1928, {{a period}} in which the Berlin city authorities had banned the SA in an effort to curb political street violence, Wessel was sent to Vienna to study the National Socialist Youth Group, as well as the organisational and tactical methods of the Nazi Party there. He returned to Berlin in July 1928 to recruit local youths, and was involved in helping to implement a reorganisation of the NSDAP in the city into a cell-structure similar to that used by the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (KPD). Wessel did this despite SA rules forbidding its members from working for the party.|$|E
5|$|As chancellor, Hitler {{worked against}} {{attempts}} by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building. According to Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire. Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are {{of the opinion that}} the NSDAP itself was responsible. At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order. Activities of the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 {{he joined}} the USPD (Independent German Social Democratic Party) and fought {{alongside}} Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in the 1918 revolution.

They also went farther to express their support for same-sex relationships, and gay and lesbians were allowed to serve in their forces before the entire country. Other <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> present in Germany and other European countries have also officially endorsed LGBT rights, including the right to same-sex marriage, and some even have extensive LGBT platforms in their parties, such as the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> [...] "DKP Queer". The chairman of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland is openly homosexual and the party also participates in the LGBT working group of the European Left Party.

[...] In the internal party strife that was a feature of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> during the 1920s she tended to find herself on the left of the party, grouped with comrades such as Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow. She continued with the same group in 1925 when the party leadership was captured by a stalinist group centred on Ernst Thälmann. The Soviet and <b>German</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> were closely connected, and in September 1926 {{she was one of those}} who signed what came to be known as the [...] "Letter from 700" [...] ("Brief der 700"), protesting against Thälmann's uncritical backing for Stalin.

[...] Outside the chamber he built up the so-called [...] "Betriebsberichterstattung (BB-Ressort)", originated in 1927 within the party's illegal military apparatus, but from 1932 consciously separated from it. It was a quasi-military body comprising approximately 300 members who undertook economic-espionage tasks on behalf of the Soviet Union, also reporting back on social, political and economic developments more generally during what was a period of rising tension inside Germany. [...] Seen from the perspective of he Nazi Party the [...] "BB-Ressort" [...] was [...] "the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> most dangerous structure".|$|R
5|$|The Second Congress of the Communist International {{opened in}} Petrograd's Smolny Institute in July 1920, {{representing}} {{the last time}} that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow. There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones. For this conference, he authored , a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and <b>German</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause. The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland, and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August.

25|$|Aderca's take on fascism {{was more}} {{ambiguous}} than his stance on antisemitism. In {{addition to the}} retrospective parable in Muzică de balet, {{a number of his}} earlier texts feature more or less explicit anti-fascist tropes. This is the case of 1916, with its grim prognosis of radical nationalism, and Oameni excepționali, where Nazism appears as a heterogeneous ideology. Aderca saw Adolf Hitler as a pale copy of Stalin and a reluctant follower of Marxian economics, propelled into high office by the inconsistencies of the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> According to Zalis, anti-fascistm is even present in the 1940 study of Peter the Great: Hitler was destroying a Europe that Peter had once helped civilize. In the late 1940s, investigating the wartime antisemitic crimes, Aderca objected to violent retribution, noting that victims had gained the moral high ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{war ended}} in May 1945 and after nearly {{twelve years of}} exile, Ewald Munschke {{returned}} in September {{of the same year}} to Berlin, where there was no longer anything left of his parents' house. The eastern part of the city was under Soviet control: Munschke re-registered his Communist Party membership and was almost immediately given a job within the local party organisation before being appointed, in April 1946, to a position as Communist Party Secretary in the Berlin Police. He remained with the Berlin police department till 1949. In the meantime the <b>German</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was abolished later in April 1946 {{as a result of a}} controversial merger with the more moderately left-wing SPD (party). Within the Soviet occupation zone this established the basis for a return to one-party government. Communist Party members, along with those from the SPD, were invited to sign their membership across to the new SED party, and many did so. Ewald Munschke's own SED Party membership card is dated 1 May 1946.

In London he joined the socialist New Beginning anti-Nazi opposition group and started working as a broadcaster with the Broadcaster of the European Revolution radio station which transmitted from London between 1940 and 1942, before being effectively subsumed into the more snappily named British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Between 1943 and 1945 Anders worked as chief editor for German language workers' broadcasts by the BBC.
