5|$|After {{three years}} as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave,</b> Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E

Turgut Reis was captured {{and was forced to}} work as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> in the ship of Giannettino Doria for nearly four years before being imprisoned in Genoa.

25|$|Job Hartop (1550–1595) was a farmer's boy {{working on}} the land near Bourne, but he hankered after a life of {{adventure}} and ran away to sea when he was twelve years old. After a short apprenticeship with a gunpowder manufacturer in London, he signed on with the English admiral Sir John Hawkins and sailed the Spanish Main {{in the company of}} the young Francis Drake. He was captured by the Spanish on his third voyage and spent ten years as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> and thirteen in a Spanish prison but escaped and returned to Bourne where he died, aged 45.|$|E
25|$|Yonge soon was at sea again. During {{this period}} he {{undertook}} several voyages with the Newfoundland fisheries. The first was in May 1663 when aged 16, he took {{passage in the}} ship Reformation. Yonge spent time on land and used to walk between settlements, making sketches and observations on the industry. In January 1666, during the Second Dutch War, his ship, the Bonaventure was captured by the Dutch and he was shackled together with other prisoners, for fifty one days. (The biography of the Victorian writer Charlotte Yonge by Christabel Coleridge refers to Yonge being a <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> of the Moors, possibly conflating {{the time he was}} a Dutch prisoner with the fact that he did serve off Algiers whilst in the Navy.) In September 1666 he was exchanged for a relative of the secretary of the Dutch Admiralty, who was a prisoner at Harwich.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of {{individual}} vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their structural limits, and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or slaves, which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the alla sensile method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing a scaloccio, which required less skill. A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers working it together and the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the loss}} of Rhodes, the Order was granted the Maltese Islands and Tripoli by Emperor Charles V. In 1537 Valette became Governor of Tripoli, where he tried to restore order within the {{vulnerable}} city. In 1538 he was imprisoned in the Gozo prison for four months after attacking a man. In 1541 Valette {{was involved in a}} naval battle against Abd-ur-Rahman Kust Aly, in which he was wounded and his galley, the San Giovanni, was captured. De Valette was taken as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> for a year by Barbary pirates under the command of Turgut Reis but was later freed during an exchange of prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Andronikos Kantakouzenos ( [...] ; [...] or Andronie Cantacuzino; 1553 – late 1601), {{also known}} as Mihaloğlu Derviş, was an Ottoman Greek {{entrepreneur}} and political figure, primarily active in Wallachia and Moldavia. He {{was the son of}} Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu, a powerful merchant of the Ottoman Empire, executed by Murad III in 1578. Forced to honor his father's outstanding debt, and briefly imprisoned as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave,</b> he rebuilt the fortune through commerce and political intrigues. In the 1590s, he was continuing his father's involvement as kingmaker for both Wallachia and Moldavia, acting as patron for a succession of Hospodars: Stephen the Deaf, Petru Cercel, Aaron the Tyrant and Peter the Lame all benefited from his financing. From 1591, he involved himself directly in the administration of both countries. Integrated within Moldo–Wallachian boyardom, he was Vistier, and then the first-ever Ban of Oltenia to be appointed directly by the Ottomans.|$|E

2500|$|The lavish wedding {{itself may}} have played a part in Şeytanoğlu's downfall, {{contributing}} to his arrest for tax evasion, during which he was shown to be involved in an anti-Ottoman intrigue. One theory, advanced by scholar Matei Cazacu, is that Sultan Murad III had discovered Kantakouzenos' sponsorship of Ioan Potcoavă, who wanted to take Moldavia out of the Ottomans' orbit. Andronikos was also imprisoned, then, in March 1578, was forced to watch as his father was hanged at Anhialo. He escaped more serious punishment by taking flight across the Black Sea to Istanbul, where he asked and obtained protection from Şeytanoğlu's friend Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, the Grand Vizier. He was detained as a <b>galley</b> <b>slave</b> for the Ottoman Navy, but Sokollu released him after some weeks of servitude, with Andronikos promising to liquidate his father's debts. The persecutions also fell on the [...] "Palaiologoi" [...] branch of the Kantakouzenos, with Constantine fleeing for safety to the Crimean Khanate.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish fleet {{captured}} all 11 Ottoman galleys, two {{of which}} were the Venetian Moceniga and Bibiena, which the Ottomans had captured at the Battle of Preveza. They also took 1,200 Ottoman prisoners and freed 1,200 Christian galley slaves. Dragut was among the Ottoman prisoners. Furious at having been captured by a young man such as Gianettino Doria, he insulted his captor, who in turn beat him in revenge. Dragut was carried to Genoa and reduced to a <b>galley</b> <b>slave.</b> There, according to the 16th-century French historian Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme, on finding Barbarossa's former lieutenant rowing in a galley, Jean Parisot de Valette, the future Grand-Master of the Knights Hospitaller, said to him: [...] "Señor Dragut, usanza de guerra!" [...] (Mr. Dragut, custom of war), to which Dragut replied: [...] "Y mudanza de fortuna" [...] (And change of fortune). At the beginning of 1541 Barbarossa ransomed his lieutenant in exchange for 3,500 ducats. Later deemed a mistake, Doria granted [...] Dragut his freedom {{in the hope of}} winning favour if one of his nephews should fall into Ottoman hands.|$|E
