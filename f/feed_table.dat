40|$|In Mexico, {{the culture}} of tilapia has {{developed}} in rural areas, where the main problem is low producer income. The state of Yucatan also experiences this situation, and scarcity of money needed to purchase inputs results in complementary feeding with chaya (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), whose leaves are edible for humans and animals. In this situation, CINVESTAV conducted experiments to determine the optimal level of substitution of balanced feed with ray chaya leaves. The test with 25 % and 50 % reduced balanced feed complemented with chaya (ad libitum) did not show significant differences (P> 0. 05) in growth compared to fishes fed with a complete ration of balanced feed (100 % <b>feed</b> <b>table).</b> A bioeconomic model was developed, including a submodel of growth according to observed results in each test. The model was developed in Excel, considering economic and management components. In addition, the analysis was completed using the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) to evaluate cost minimization. According to the MRTS results, {{it is necessary to}} add 2. 4 units of chaya for each reduced unit of balanced feed, {{in order to maintain the}} same level of production. Substituting 50 % of the recommended ration (<b>feed</b> <b>table)</b> with chaya resulted in lower production costs, generating profit maximization. bioeconomic model, cost minimization, Tilapia, Livestock Production/Industries, O 13, Q 22,...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were separately conducted using cottonseed cake-based diets to <b>feed</b> <b>table</b> birds. In the first experiment (phase 1) broiler birds were fed from day old to 8 weeks of age, {{while in the}} second experiment (phase 2), the birds were fed cottonseed cake based diets from 4 - 8 weeks of age. Five dietary treatments were fed in both experiments formulated to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous with Cottonseed Cake (CSC) replacing Soyabean Cake (SBC) at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % respectively. The live weight of broilers in the phases differed significantly (p< 0. 05) with broilers in phase 2 being better. The dressed weight was higher in phase 2 than phase 1. Broilers fed CSC based diets from 4 weeks had better feed conversion ratio than those fed from day old. Similar trend was observed in haematological and serum biochemistry parameters in the different treatments of the two phases. It can be concluded that feeding CSC protein as replacement for SBC protein was better from 4 weeks of age in respect of broiler performance though at a higher cost than the former...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a noninvasive method to assess <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed (mm/s) in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> (mm/rotation) was measured at selected nominal <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speeds, given as low (26. 67 mm/s), intermediate (48. 00 mm/s), and high (64. 00 mm/s), by utilizing a computed radiography (CR) cassette installed with a photostimulable phosphor plate. The cassette was placed on the examination table to travel through the isocenter longitudinally, with a total scan length of over 430 mm. The distance travelled was employed to determine the total <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> length. To calculate the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed, gantry rotation time was measured concurrently at a preselected nominal rotation time of 750 ms. Upon completion of data acquisition, the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> and gantry rotation time were analyzed and used to calculate the actual <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed (mm/s). Under the low <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed setting, the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed was found to be 26. 67 mm/s.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of feeding systems for ruminants towards evaluation of diets {{in terms of}} multiple responses requires the updating of the calculation of nutrient supply to the animals {{to make it more}} accurate on aggregated units (feed unit, or UF, for energy and protein digestible in the intestine, or PDI, for metabolizable protein) and to allow prediction of absorbed nutrients. The present update of the French system is based on the building and interpretation through meta-analysis of large databases on digestion and nutrition of ruminants. Equations involved in the calculation of UF and PDI have been updated, allowing: (1) prediction of the out flow rate of particles and liquid depending on the level of intake and the proportion of concentrate, and the use of this in the calculation of ruminal digestion of protein and starch from in situ data; (2) the system {{to take into account the}} effects of the main factors of digestive interactions (level of intake, proportion of concentrate, rumen protein balance) on organic matter digestibility, energy losses in methane and in urine; (3) more accurate calculation of the energy available in the rumen and the efficiency of its use for the microbial protein synthesis. In this renewed model UF and PDI values of feedstuffs vary depending on diet composition, and intake level. Consequently, standard <b>feed</b> <b>table</b> values can be considered as being only indicative. It is thus possible to predict the nutrient supply on a wider range of diets more accurately and in particular to better integrate energy x protein interactions occurring in the gut...|$|E
40|$|Two {{areas of}} {{research}} are reported in this study. First, the comparison between the profitability of a high performance flock and a low performance flock run at a higher stocking rate on Massey University's Tuapaka hill country unit. Second, the comparison between simple feed budgeting and complex simulation modelling as methodologies used {{in the design of}} pastoral based systems. While the higher performance flock is found to be marginally more profitable than the lower performance flock, the simple (spreadsheet based) feed budget models used for the analysis show little difference in the pattern of feed demand between the flocks. The greatest differences in profitability were due to stocking rate rather than performance. A low stocking rate system that allowed lambs to be grown out to heavy carcass weights was found to be the most profitable system for Tuapaka. A number of weaknesses can be identified in the simple feed budgeting approach however. These include: limited <b>feed</b> <b>table</b> data on the effects of different levels of nutrition on animal performance for the periods of pregnancy and lactation; a lack of <b>feed</b> <b>table</b> data on the relationship between feed intake and wool production, and failure {{to take into account the}} interaction between pasture cover, pasture growth rates, pasture quality, animal intake and subsequent levels of animal performance. These latter two weaknesses are analysed by using spreadsheet based simulation models in the second part of the study. The results of these analysis indicate that wool production is under-estimated by the simple feed budget model, particularly in the case of the high performance flock. Correcting this increases the profit margin between the two flocks, but does not alter the rankings. Analysis of the effect of interactions between pasture components and animal performance over the period of lactation shows that the simple feed budget approach fails to represent the true situation in terms of the pattern of pasture growth, animal intakes and subsequent performance levels, and that this is especially so where pasture cover falls below 1000 kg DM/HA. This analysis suggests that the linear relationships assumed in the simple feed budget approach do not hold in reality. The conclusions from this study are that a high performance, low stocking rate system would be more profitable than a low performance, high stocking rate system for the Tuapaka hill country unit, but that it would offer little advantage in terms of better matching feed demand and feed supply. Complex simulation modelling has a number of advantages over the simple feed budgeting technique. However, the use of these models is dependent on the validation of the models and the construction of models that are "user-friendly". The study identified a number of areas where further work is required in the validation of some of the more complex inter-relationships. Simple feed budgeting is quick and simple to use, and in a gross sense provides feasible results provided pasture cover levels are maintained within certain bounds. The definition of the upper and lower bounds requires further work, a review of the literature suggests they are 1000 and 1700 kg DM/HA. The use of spreadsheet technology proved highly effective for the development of simple feed budget models. However, there were a number of constraints evident when spreadsheets were used for the construction of more complex models. These included, capacity, calculation time and limitations in terms of the availability of mathematical formulae. With further developments in this technology expected, spreadsheets should prove a useful tool in the development of more complex simulation models...|$|E
40|$|Vineyards {{around the}} world sustain {{significant}} economic losses due to grape loss and damage caused by frugivorous passerine birds, and while bird control methods are in place, their efficacy is limited and/or short lived. With the call for more sustainable agricultural practices globally, it would be advantageous to offer an ecologically based solution to the bird problem in vineyards, while further research and development into cheaper, more effective methods of bird control that does not create noise or disturbance to communities surrounding vineyards is required. The Australasian harrier, a native, diurnal New Zealand raptor, is the focal species of this project. With considerable numbers of harriers sited around New Zealand viticultural land, {{the aim of this}} project was to attract populations of these harriers into vineyards by providing them with an important food source – animal carcasses. The presence of harriers was expected to exploit the innate fear that pest passerine birds have towards raptors and provide an effective biological control aid that would provide an economically and environmentally sound solution to passerine bird induced grape damage as the passerines responded to the harrier rather than foraging on grapes. The Australian harrier was attracted to raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> in Canterbury and Wairarapa vineyards with supplementary food. Results indicated it was difficult to attain regular <b>feeding</b> from all <b>tables</b> set up. Some <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> sites saw harriers <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> regularly and intermittently, while at other sites no harriers exploited the tables. When presented with a two choice food test on <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> comprising one-day-old cock chicks and rabbit pieces in the springtime, chicks (86 %) were the harriers’ clear choice over rabbit pieces (14 %). During the summer season, there was no preference, with equal amounts of both baits taken. Where <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> were present, pest bird abundance decreased by 56 %, and grape damage also decreased by 59 %; however, these results were not necessarily linked only to harrier presence. While harrier numbers increased due to <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> so did the number of other predators. A further trial without <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> where supplementary food was placed on the ground to attract all predators, showed an increase of predators in the treatment sites compared to control sites, with harriers and cats the most frequently observed. Pest passerine bird densities in the control sites were higher than the treatment sites. Raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> baited with animal carcasses are not necessarily a reliable method to encourage harrier feeding in vineyards. Several reasons may explain why this method may be unreliable. The best reason may be the motivation to feed off a novel object, i. e. the raised table was not sufficient because of neophobic tendencies for some harriers, and these were difficult to overcome. Alternative, easily accessible food sources were readily available in some landscapes and agonistic relationships with other species, who were frequently seen harassing harriers in study sites, may well have confounded attempts to achieve <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> at all sites. Findings perhaps negate the need for any <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> and supplementary <b>feeding</b> alone may be the key to attracting harriers and other predators into vineyards to achieve the fundamental goal of decreasing pest passerine bird numbers and consequent grape damage...|$|R

The assessment of temperature impact was based on data from 16 hottest days (H) and 16 coldest days (L). The experimental group consisted of 70 cows in various stage of lactation (30 d– 210 d) and parity (1 – 8). The cows were housed in a section (one quarter) of a free-stall barn with 77 stalls in three rows. Row A was located peripherally, close to the side wall, row B was in the middle and row C was situated centrally, close to the <b>feed</b> <b>table.</b> The cows were observed weekly on the same day at 9. 00 a. m. The microclimate characteristics were recorded daily: temperature in hot (H) resp. cold (L) period was in average 27. 1 °C resp. – 1. 47 °C, and relative humidity 54. 4 [*]% resp. 77. 3 [*]%, and THI 75 resp. 33. Behaviour was described by a number of cows standing or lying down, number of cows lying down on their left or right side and row preference (A, B, C) in the resting area. Cow Comfort Index (CCI – a number of cows lying down at given time) was calculated. A total of 1587 observations were analysed. A number of cows lying down (922) was significantly higher than that of standing cows (665). Milk production was significantly higher in hot (H) period (by 1. 0 – 1. 7 kg). There was an interaction in milk production between period and standing. In H period the standing cows produced more milk, in L period vice versa. The cows with non-significant tendency towards left-side laterality produced more milk (by 1. 2 kg). No interaction was found between period and laterality for milk production. All the observed parameters significantly differed between rows A, B and C. Row A was the most preferred, the cows preferring it were young (low number of lactation) with greatest milk production. The cows in row C had the lowest milk production and were in late lactation. The interaction was found between period and row affected number of lactation (P < 0. 01) and number of cows (P < 0. 05).

In contrast, fast-exploring nonterritorial juveniles had lower dominance ranks than did slow-exploring nonterritorial juveniles, implying that the relation between dominance and personality is context-dependent in the wild.

Experiment took place in a particular breeding station in winter and summer. The factors included: current milk yield (kg milk), order of lactation (n) and stage of lactation (days). The object of observation was one section with 59 pits arranged in two rows. Row 1 - closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> (n = 29), row 2 - situated closer to the perimeter wall of the stable (n = 30). Dairy cows located in pits were monitored for frequency of standing and lying down. Lying dairy cows, were then monitored for the preferences of lying on the left or right side (laterality). Entry was done during a direct monitoring of dairy cows to a precise diagram of the section by group photoshots. The results demonstrated statistically high probative value that all cows most filled the row located closest to the <b>feeding</b> <b>table.</b> Furthermore, it was found that cows with the yield of 30. 1 - 40 kg of milk preferred the row that was closer to the perimeter wall of the stable (P < 0. 01).

The air temperature in dairy cow's stall was 13. 5 °C (H 0) and after 24 hours of storage (H 24) 15 °C. The temperature of the silage in 30 cm depth was 28 °C (H 0) and 40. 3 °C (H 24). After 24 hours of aerobic exposure, the content of dry matter, starch, hemicelluloses and neutral detergent fiber in maize silage was statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) increased. Our results indicate a reduction in vitro organic matter digestibility and a decrease in energy and nitrogen values during aerobic exposure. We found statistically significant (P < 0. 05) decrease in lactic acid content, the degree of proteolysis and an increase in acetic acid (by 41 %) in maize silage with Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus during 24 hours aerobic exposure...|$|R

40|$|Investment {{costs for}} eight {{different}} type housing systems for dairy cows has been calculated {{in order to}} compare the building costs {{as a function of}} herd size, shelter type and automatization. A commercial calculation programme for building was used and complemented with prices of equipments specific for dairy cow building. Herd sizes were 120, 250 and 400 cows. The milking equipments were automatic milking system (AMS), parallel parlour with 32 stalls (2 x 16) and rotary parlour with 24 stalls. Shelter was either insulated equipped with automatic cable driven scrapers on solid alleys, automatic feed wagon on rails, or uninsulated with manual manure handling and a tractor driven mobile mixer wagon on a drive-through <b>feeding</b> <b>table.</b> Building cost per cow or per kg milk was calculated using an average life time and 6...|$|R

40|$|In Europe, broiler {{chickens}} are {{fed with}} balanced diets where the energy is mainly supplied by wheat. The feed industry considers wheat a moderately uniform raw material and therefore its energy content and nutrient digestibility {{are taken from}} <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> (tabulated values) and assigned to all wheat grains. However, all major wheat-producing countries report considerable variability in energy content of wheat which invalidates the assumption of uniformity among wheat grains and forces the industry {{to look for the}} factors responsible of the variation. This PhD has focused on the study of factors that affect the nutritional value of wheat for broiler chickens. After the literature review, few nutrient components of the wheat grain (starch and non-starch polysaccharides) where selected and deeper studied in different wheat cultivars fed to broiler chickens. Emphasis was put on the rate of wheat starch digestion by broiler chickens and its effect on broiler performance...|$|R
