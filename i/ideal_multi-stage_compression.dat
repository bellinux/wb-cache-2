The non-continuous electricity from wind and solar can be stored in terms of compressed air energy, which can be released at peak time of state grid. In this paper, the influences of <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> and waste heat recovery on characteristic of CAES system were investigated. Results indicated that the adoption of <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> technology obviously reduced its heat rate, and the adoption of heat recovery improved its energy conversion efficiency. Among the three compression cases in this paper, the compression power consumed per kilogram air for the single-stage compression process was 890. 83 Kj/Kg, while which of the three-stage compression process with inter-cooler reduced to 524. 82 Kj/Kg. Meanwhile, the CAES system with three-stage compression and heat recovery had a low heat rate of 3974 Kj/Kw•h and a high energy conversion efficiency of 59. 92 %...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of hot-rolling conditions on structure of new-developed high-manganese austenitic steels. Design/methodology/approach: Flow stresses during continuous and <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> tests were measured using the Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. To describe the hot-working behaviour, the steels were compressed to the various amount of deformation (4 x 0. 29, 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19). The microstructure evolution in different stages of hot-rolling was determined in metallographic investigations using light microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Findings: The steels are characterized by different microstructure in the initial state. Steel with higher Al concentration has stable microstructure of austenite with annealing twins, while steel with higher Si concentration consists of certain portion of ε martensite in form of plates. The flow stresses are in the range of 200 - 430 MPa for the applied conditions of hot-working and are up to 40 MPa lower compared to continuous compressions. Results of the <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 29 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure as a result of dynamic recrystallization. In case of applying the lower deformations 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19, the process controlling work hardening is dynamic recovery. On the basis of analysis of thermo-mechanical treatment carried out in continuous axisymetrical <b>compression</b> test and <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> test using the Gleeble 3800 simulator allowed to work out a schedule of three different variants of hot-rolling for each of investigated steels 26 Mn- 3 Si- 3 Al-Nb-Ti and 27 Mn- 4 Si- 2 Al-Nb-Ti. Research limitations/implications: To fully describe the hot-rolling behaviour of the new-developed steels, further investigations in wider temperature and strain rate ranges are required. Practical implications: Various conditions of hot-rolling for advanced high-manganese austenitic steels can be useful to determine influence of microstructure on mechanical properties obtained in static and dynamic tensile test.

The processes controlling work hardening and removing it were identified by microstructure evolution observations in successive stages of compression with the amount of true strain 4 x 0. 29, 4 x 0. 23 or 4 x 0. 19. Findings: The investigated steel is characterized by high values of flow stresses from 250 to 450 MPa. Increase of flow stress along with decrease of compression temperature is accompanied by translation of εmax strain in the direction of higher deformation. Results of the <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 29 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure as a result of dynamic recrystallization.

Design/methodology/approach: The force-energetic parameters of hot-working were determined in continuous and <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> test performed in temperature range of 850 to 1100 °C using the Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator.

The microstructure evolution in successive stages of deformation was determined in metallographic investigations using light, scanning and electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Findings: The investigated steels are characterized by high values of flow stresses from 230 to 450 MPa. The flow stresses are much higher in comparison with austenitic Cr-Ni and Cr-Mn steels and slightly higher compared to Fe-(15 - 25) Mn alloys. Increase of flow stress along with decrease of compression temperature is accompanied by translation of εmax strain {{in the direction of}} higher deformation. Results of the <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 29 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure as a result of dynamic recrystallization.

Design/methodology/approach: The thermo-mechanical processing was realized in a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> test by the use of the Gleeble thermomechanical simulator. The steel was isothermally held for 600 s in a bainitic transformation temperature range of 250 to 500 °C. A fraction and stereological parameters of retained austenite were determined by a computer image analyser using an optical microscope. The details of the retained austenite morphology were revealed in a scanning electron microscope and using EBSD technique. Findings: The maximum fraction of retained austenite (above 14 %) was obtained for the temperatures of isothermal bainitic transformation from 400 to 450 °C. Below 350 °C, the largest grains of retained austenite located in a ferritic matrix transform to martensite and its fraction estimated by the use of computer image analysis is too high compared to X-ray investigations. Blocky, irregular grains located in a ferritic matrix are a main structural constituent of retained austenite in a temperature range up to 350 °C. Increasing the isothermal holding temperature to a range of 400 - 450 °C results in increasing a fraction of fine blocky and layer regions of the γ phase. Research limitations/implications: To describe in detail morphological features of retained austenite in fine-grained multiphase structures, a combination of different methods characterized by various resolution is necessary. Practical implications: The revealed morphological features of retained austenite are of great importance for mechanical stability of this phase during cold straining, affecting mechanical properties of advanced TRIP-assisted steels.

Design/methodology/approach: In {{order to determine the}} influence of MX-type interstitial phases on limiting the grain growth of primary austenite, samples were quenched in water from a temperature range, from 900 to 1200 °C. Determination of processes controlling strain hardening was carried out in compression test using Gleeble 3800 simulator. The σ-ε curves were defined in a temperature range from 850 to 1150 °C, for 0. 1, 1 and 10 s- 1 of strain rate. To determine the progress of recrystallization samples were isothermally held for up to 60 s at 900 and 1000 °C. Findings: Profitable impact of TiN and NbC particles on austenite grain growth limitation is present up to 1050 °C. The values of flow stress are equal from 120 to 270 MPa. The steel is characterized by quite high values of deformation, εmax= 0. 4 - 0. 65, corresponding to maximum stress on σ-ε curves. Beneficial grain refinement of primary austenite microstructure can be obtained due to static recrystallization. In temperature of 1000 °C, t 0. 5 is equal 35 s and elongates to 43 s after decreasing deformation temperature to 900 °C. The σ-ε curves obtained during <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> tests confirmed that a process controlling the strain hardening is a dynamical recovery. Research limitations/implications: To design hot-rolling conditions, the analysis of the primary austenite microstructure evolution during successive deformation cycles should be carried out. Practical implications: The obtained precipitation kinetics of MX-type phases and σ-ε curves are useful in determining hot-rolling conditions ensuring the fine-grained microstructure of primary austenite.

40|$|In {{very low}} ambient {{temperature}} regions, both heating capacity and {{coefficient of performance}} (COP) of traditional air-source vapor compression heat pumps drop significantly with a decrease in outdoor air temperature. The current study investigates two alternative technologies for improving the efficiency of vapor compression cycles especially at very low ambient temperatures. The first method is liquid flooded compression with regeneration in which {{a significant amount of}} non-volatile liquid is mixed into the stream of refrigerant vapor entering the compressor in order to approach an isothermal compression process. The second method is multi-port refrigerant injection during compression and economizing which is similar to <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> in providing refrigerant cooling between compressor stages and a lower refrigerant quality entering the evaporator. ^ Both technology improvements address the thermodynamic inefficiencies that are inherent within the simple vapor compression cycle that is employed in most heat pumping equipment. The benefits of oil flooding and saturated vapor injection are evaluated using experimental testing of an oil flooded R 410 A scroll compressor and a 2 port saturated vapor injection R 410 A scroll compressor and simulation. The results show that the performance of the compressor increases with oil flooding and saturated vapor injection especially at very low evaporation temperatures. The experimental compressor results were used for system analysis of liquid flooded compression with regeneration and saturated vapor injection. At - 10 °C ambient temperature, estimated COP (heating) of the flooded compression with regeneration cycle was 25 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 12. 5 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. For Minneapolis, the seasonal efficiency (heating) of a flooded compression with regeneration cycle was estimated to be 34 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 21 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. Both technologies lead to higher energy efficiency and less degradation in heating capacity at low ambient temperatures. Also, a previously developed detailed flooded scroll compressor model has been validated with the oil flooding experimental data, for which good agreement was found. ...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) plants are energy intensive. As a result, the power plants {{operating}} these LNG plants emit high amounts of CO 2. To mitigate global warming that {{is caused by}} the increase in atmospheric CO 2, CO 2 capture and sequestration (CCS) using amine absorption is proposed. However, the major challenge of implementing this CCS system is the associated power requirement, increasing power consumption by about 15 - 25 %. Therefore, the main scope of this work is to tackle this challenge by minimizing CCS power consumption {{as well as that of}} the entire LNG plant though system integration and rigorous optimization. The power consumption of the LNG plant was reduced through improving the process of liquefaction itself. In this work, a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize a propane pre-cooled mixed-refrigerant (C 3 -MR) LNG plant modeled using HYSYS software. An optimization platform coupling Matlab with HYSYS was developed. New refrigerant mixtures were found, with savings in power consumption as high as 13 %. LNG plants optimization with variable natural gas feed compositions was addressed and the solution was proposed through applying robust optimization techniques, resulting in a robust refrigerant which can liquefy a range of natural gas feeds. The second approach for reducing the power consumption is through process integration and waste heat utilization in the integrated CCS system. Four waste heat sources and six potential uses were uncovered and evaluated using HYSYS software. The developed models were verified against experimental data from the literature with good agreement. Net available power enhancement in one of the proposed CCS configuration is 16 % more than the conventional CCS configuration. To reduce the CO 2 pressurization power into a well for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, five CO 2 pressurization methods were explored. New CO 2 liquefaction cycles were developed and modeled using HYSYS software. One of the developed liquefaction cycles using NH 3 as a refrigerant resulted in 5 % less power consumption than the conventional <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> cycle. Finally, a new concept of providing the CO 2 regeneration heat is proposed. The proposed concept is using a heat pump to provide the regeneration heat as well as process heat and CO 2 liquefaction heat. Seven configurations of heat pumps integrated with CCS were developed. One of the heat pumps consumes 24 % less power than the conventional system or 59 % less total equivalent power demand than the conventional system with steam extraction and CO 2 compression...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) is a fast growing energy carrier {{suitable}} for transport {{of natural gas}} when the distance from source to market is long and/or the volumes are moderate. In order to liquefy the natural gas, and thereby reduce its volume, energy demanding low-temperature refrigeration over a wide temperature range is required. Hence, energy efficient designs depend on small temperature differences in heat transfer. Over the years, many process concepts have been proposed for liquefaction of natural gas, with different advantages and disadvantages. While development of LNG processes {{for a long time}} was concerned primarily with increased capacity and energy efficiency, the emergence of new applications such as remote gas and floating operations have put focus also on properties such as safety, environmental impact, compactness, operability and flexibility. For all applications, optimization is essential for fair comparison of different process concepts, in order to minimize cost, energy use and environmental impact. Due to characteristics of the liquefaction processes and the rigorous thermodynamic models required for practical feasibility of the design, optimization of LNG processes is a complex problem. In order to accommodate this challenge, the focus of this work has been to improve the optimization problem formulation through use of thermodynamic analysis and insight, with the objective of enabling rigorous and robust optimization of both simple and complex process concepts. In this work, the refrigeration processes have been modelled with a commercial process simulation tool using cubic equations of state. Optimization has been performed using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm. A stochastic search algorithm (simulated annealing) has also been tested. The observed performance was, however, better for the deterministic search method. Processes studied in this project include single mixed-refrigerant process, single and dual nitrogen expander processes, pure-refrigerant cascade processes and a dual mixed-refrigerant process. Optimization studies of nitrogen expander processes have been carried out both with a simplified process model assuming perfect gas behaviour of the refrigerant and a rigorous process model using a cubic equation of state. Comparison of the results indicated agreement between the models only for a limited number of cases. In the majority of the case studies, a better solution was found for the rigorous model accounting for the non-idealities of the refrigerant. The intermediate pressure levels in <b>multi-stage</b> <b>compression</b> with intercooling have been optimized for the case of perfect gas behaviour and constant isentropic efficiency. For the case of different suction temperatures in the different compression stages, the results indicate that the optimal intermediate pressure levels are characterized by uniform discharge temperatures for the compression stages rather than uniform pressure ratios. A heuristic rule for the optimal intermediate pressure in <b>multi-stage</b> real gas <b>compression</b> has also been proposed. For a single mixed-refrigerant cycle this was proven to generally provide high accuracy. The influence of the choice of decision variables and bounds on the optimization search performance has been illustrated for optimization of pure-refrigerant cascade processes. Compared to a fairly obvious choice of variables, a set of decision variables based on process characteristics was found to give significant improvement in the success rate of the optimization search. Exergy analysis of cascade refrigeration processes have been used to illustrate the interaction between the different refrigeration cycles in a cascade. The results demonstrate that the solution that provides the smallest compression power in a single cycle not necessarily coincides with the solution that gives the smallest power consumption for the overall process. Based on these findings, an approach for design and optimization of complex cascade processes has been proposed as an alternative to simultaneous optimization of all variables. In the suggested approach, the load distribution between the different cycles in the cascade is optimized in an outer loop, while the different refrigeration cycles are optimized sequentially in an inner loop starting from the lowest temperature level. The principles of the procedure have been illustrated for a dual mixed-refrigerant process. Studies on the influence of constraint formulations for optimal trade-off between operating and investment costs in LNG process design have proven the inadequacy of the common approach with a minimum temperature difference constraint. A case study presented for a single mixed-refrigerant process illustrated that significant savings in energy use could be realized by optimal distribution of heat transfer driving forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of microfractures within rock is commonly observed as rock is strained. The {{presence of these}} microfractures constitutes damage to the rock, and this damage can reduce the rock's strength. This paper explores the evolution of rock strength as microfractures within a rock accumulate. Two approaches involving different laboratory tests are used to study how cohesion and internal friction evolve during progressive damage to rock. The mobilized cohesion and friction angle are measured for intact and damaged rock specimens. Intact rock specimens tested under compression {{were used to determine}} the peak values of cohesion and friction angle for two types of rock. Specimens of rock with varying amounts of accumulated microfracture damage were tested under direct shear or <b>multi-stage</b> triaxial <b>compression</b> to measure the Coulomb strength parameters for damaged rock. The laboratory testing shows that cohesion decreases with strain as the rock accumulates internal damage caused by microfracturing before the peak strength. The frictional component of the rock strength starts to be mobilized as strain causes internal microfractures. The mobilized internal friction angle increases up to and slightly beyond the peak strength. A small amount of post-peak strain is required to initiate macroscopic slip surfaces, and until these are created, high frictional resistance is mobilized between the many interacting and interlocked pieces of rock in the test specimen. With further post-peak strain, the friction angle decreases as the macroscopic slip surfaces in the rock become well established...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} for conventional triaxial compression (CTC) test requires three separate soil specimens {{to be examined}} to failure under different confining pressures so that Mohr-Coulomb (or stress path) failure envelope can be determined and soil shear strength parameters can be obtained.

There are several advantages for using MST over CTC, which apart from fewer soil specimens, include less laboratory time consumption and reduced effects of heterogeneity among the specimens tested. However, {{it has been argued}} in the literature that the advantages of using MST may be compromised by its inability to obtain reliable soil behavior or accurate shear strength parameters.
