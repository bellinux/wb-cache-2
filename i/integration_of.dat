5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the mitochondria, {{the product of an}} endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
