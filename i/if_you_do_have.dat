500|$|Until the 13th century, the Japanese {{preferred}} Bai Juyi {{above all}} poets {{and there were}} few references to Du Fu, although his influence {{can be seen in}} some kanshi ("Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets") anthologies such as Bunka Shūreishū in the 9th century. The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu's poetry was Kokan Shiren (1278–1346), a Rinzai Zen patriarch {{and one of the most}} prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol. 11 of Saihokushū. His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated [...] "influenced by Du Fu" [...] in their prefaces. Chūgan's student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu's poetry in the mundane world; one day Nijō Yoshimoto, the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry, asked Gidō, [...] "Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai?" [...] Gidō dared to reply, [...] "Yes <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> enough capability. No if do not." [...] Since then, there had been many seminars on Du Fu's poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society, and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period, e.g., Taiheiki, a historical epic in the late 14th century, and some noh plays such as Hyakuman, Bashō, and Shunkan.|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Washington, Lombardi's {{assistant}} general manager David Slatterly was gay, as was PR director Joe Blair, who was described as Lombardi's [...] "right-hand man." [...] According to son Vince Lombardi, Jr., [...] "He saw everyone as equals, and I think having a gay brother (Hal) was a big factor in his approach...I think my father would've felt, 'I hope I've created an atmosphere {{in the locker room}} where this would not be an issue at all. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> an issue, the problem will be yours because my locker room will tolerate nothing but acceptance.'" ...|$|E

Most things are bought and sold in this country. I don't quite know how the American public will {{appreciate}} this attempted buying of the conscience of her public men. It might perhaps make you temporarily a little unpopular, necessitate a trip to Europe perhaps, or something of that sort. Well, I wish you well out of it, and now I must really go. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to come across in a hurry, Mr. Littleson, I may see something of you in Paris." ...|$|E

[...] "He was in this whole other exciting world and it looked much more exciting than the one we were in. I thought isn't it a shame that I'm not allowed to do that anymore. So I just thought what <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a guy who chose not to lose that side of his childhood?" ...|$|R

This political business, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> {{to put in a}} bit of time at it now and then, can't be going on all the while. Monte Carlo, too! So far as the women are concerned, they might as well be {{off the face of the}} earth, and I don't think I've ever seen you make a bet at the tables. How did your wife do last night?

Only resolve that your time, your strength, your money, such as you have, shall not all--nor more than half--be given to mere outward adornment, and you will go right. It {{requires}} only an army of girls animated with this noble purpose to declare independence in America, and emancipate us from the decrees and tyrannies of French actresses and ballet-dancers. En avant, girls! You yet can, if you will, save the republic." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{humbled by}} his humility; she put away in her mind, {{to take out}} and worry over later, a {{speculation}} {{as to whether it}} was not she who was naive. She urged, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to go back? Most of us do! We can't all be artists--myself, for instance. We have to darn socks, and yet we're not content to think of nothing but socks and darning-cotton. I'd demand all I could get--whether I finally settled down to designing frocks or building temples or pressing pants. What if you do drop back? You'll have had the adventure. Don't be too meek toward life! Go! You're young, you're unmarried. Try everything! Don't listen to Nat Hicks and Sam Clark and be a 'steady young man'--in order to help them make money. You're still a blessed innocent. Go and play till the Good People capture you!" ...|$|E

The run of them look uncomfortable; some are hot about the ears and in the spiteful phase of ill-temper; all look sick of the business except the raw new-comers. It's the only time they will ever select any furniture, their first chance and their last. Most of their selections are hurried a little. The salesman must not be kept all day.... Yet it goes hard with you if you buy your Object in Life and find it just a 'special line' made to sell.... We're all amateurs at living, just as we are all amateurs at furnishing--or dying. Some of the poor devils one meets carry tattered little scraps of paper, and fumble conscientiously with stumpy pencils.

5000|$|After {{the release}} of her debut single, Carpenter tried to choose a second single to promote her EP, Can't Blame a Girl for Trying.

5000|$|Andy Webb from [...] "The Movie Scene" [...] {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, stating: [...] "What this all boils down to is that [...] "The Rats" [...] is some old {{fashioned}} horror fun which plays on people's own fears of rats. Of course if you think rats are cute and adorable then this isn't {{going to work and}} you might even be offended at the portrayal of rats or the ridiculous climax. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a fear of the fury rodents this movie is not one to watch before you go to sleep." [...] Rod Lott from [...] "Flick Attack", wrote: [...] "Come up with a cliché, and sooner or later, The Rats gets to it, right down to the ever-predictable it-ain’t-really-over final shot. Child’s Play 2 and Man’s Best Friend director John Lafia does a decent job, having experience with all sorts of beasts, like killer dolls, robot dogs and Ally Sheedy." [...] Florita A. from [...] "Hell Horror", scored the film 4 out of 10, writing: [...] "The Rats was made simple, and that was not an ideal thing as the movie flopped although it was a TV movie. I like the idea of rats playing on someone’s fear, but it came down to the film not being executed in the right manner to send frights across to its audience amongst other things." ...|$|E
