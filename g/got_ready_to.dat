25|$|Meanwhile, {{the rebels}} had {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the boat from the opposite bank. After some firing, the British men on the boat decided to fly the white flag. They were escorted off the boat and taken back to Savada house. The surviving British men were sat on the ground, and Nana Sahib's soldiers <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fire on them. Their wives insisted that they would die with their husbands, but were pulled away. Nana Sahib granted the British chaplain Moncrieff's request to read prayers before they died. The British were initially wounded by the guns, and then killed with swords. The women and children were confined to Savada House, to be reunited later with their remaining colleagues, who had been captured earlier, at Bibighar.|$|E
25|$|Valencia {{began the}} {{following}} Liga season {{top of the}} league after ten matches. However, after the Christmas break, Valencia struggled to keep pace due to Champions League requirements. Héctor Cúper's team managed to eliminate Arsenal in the quarter-finals and Leeds United in the semi-finals, and <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> face Bayern Munich in the final; Valencia had reached two European Cup finals in a row. This time, the final was played in Milan at the San Siro on 23 May. Gaizka Mendieta gave Valencia the lead by scoring from the penalty spot right {{at the start of}} the match. Goalkeeper Santiago Cañizares then stopped a penalty from Mehmet Scholl, but Stefan Effenberg put Bayern level after the break thanks to another penalty. After extra time, it went to penalties, where a Mauricio Pellegrino miss gave Bayern Champions League glory and dealt Valencia a second-straight defeat in the final. Valencia went on to slip to fifth place in La Liga and out of Champions League competition for the 2001–02 season. The final match of the season meant Valencia only needed a draw at the Camp Nou against Barcelona to seal Champions League qualification. However, Los Che lost 3–2 with a last minute goal from Rivaldo, resulting in Barcelona qualifying for the Champions League while Valencia missed out.|$|E

In terms of population RTÉ was one of Europe's biggest producers of television drama.|$|E
