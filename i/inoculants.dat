40|$|In the American Midwest, {{superior}} <b>inoculant</b> rhizobia {{applied to}} soybeans usually occupy only 5 to 20 % of nodules, {{and response to}} inoculation is {{the exception rather than}} the rule. Attempts to overcome this problem have met with limited success. We evaluated the ability of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, supplied as a seed coat <b>inoculant,</b> to stay abreast of the infectible region of the developing soybean root system. The rhizoplane population of the <b>inoculant</b> strain declined with distance from site of placement, the decrease being more pronounced on lateral than on taproots. This decline was paralleled by a decrease in inoculant-strain nodule occupancy. <b>Inoculant</b> bradyrhizobia contributed little to nodulation of lateral roots, which at pod-fill accounted for more than 50 % of nodule number and mass, and were major contributors to acetylene reduction activity. From these data, it appears that <b>inoculant</b> bradyrhizobia are competitive with indigenous soil strains at the point of placement in the soil but have limited mobility and so are incapable of sustaining high populations throughout the developing root system.

40|$|Three {{strains of}} Bradyrhizobium japonicum, I 17, 110, and 61 A 76, were {{evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to form nodules on field-grown soybeans in soil with a highly competitive indigenous B. japonicum population. The predominant indigenous strain, 0336, in the field site used was unlike the more common isolates from Midwestern soils which belong to the 123 or 138 serogroups. This strain persisted in the soil for at least 30 years without any soybean crops. The three <b>inoculant</b> strains differed in their ability to compete with indigenous strains for nodule formation. Four different inoculation treatments were tested in three adjacent fields. When the amount of inoculum was increased, a higher proportion of nodules contained the <b>inoculant</b> strain. The most competitive <b>inoculant</b> strain was I 17, a recent field isolate. Strain 61 A 76 was better than 110. There was no difference in recovery of the <b>inoculant</b> strains on the Hodgson or Corsoy soybean cultivars, nor was there a difference in recovery of the <b>inoculant</b> strains during the growing season. The vertical distribution of nodules containing the <b>inoculant</b> strains was affected by the method of adding the <b>inoculant</b> to the soil. <b>Inoculant</b> added to the seed furrow produced nodules mainly in the top region of the soybean root. <b>Inoculant</b> tilled into the soil produced nodules primarily in the bottom part of the root.
