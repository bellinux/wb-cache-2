40|$|Multihomed {{subscribers}} {{are increasingly}} adopting <b>intelligent</b> route control <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> {{the cost and}} end-to-end performance of the traffic routed among the different links connecting their networks to the Internet. Until recently, IRC practices were not considered adverse, but new studies show that in a competitive environment, they can lead to persistent traffic oscillations, causing significant performance degradation rather than improvements. To cope with this, randomized IRC techniques were proposed. However, the proliferation of IRC products raises concerns, given that randomization becomes less effective {{as the number of}} interfering IRC systems increases. In this article, we present a more scalable route control strategy that can better support the foreseeable spread of IRC solutions. We show that by blending randomization with adaptive filtering techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the interference between competing route controllers, and this can be achieved without penalizing the end-to-end traffic performance. In addition to the potential improvements in terms of scalability and performance, the route control strategy outlined here has various practical advantages. For instance, it does not require any kind of protocol or coordination between the competing IRC middleboxes, and it can be adopted readily today because the only requirement is a software upgrade of the available route controllers.

40|$|Abstract One of {{the most}} {{significant}} paradigm shifts of modern business management is that individual businesses no longer compete as autonomous entities but rather as supply chains. However, the majority of companies, especially small and medium enterprises, fail to design and manage their supply chains in a profitable way, as it is difficult to understand the complex dynamics of Supply Chain Management (SCM). In this paper we argue that agent technologies can provide an <b>intelligent</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> the improvement of SCM. We present a multiagent-based framework for simulating supply chain (SC) operation and re-configuration, with the vision of helping to improve overall SC performance and coordination. The suggested key innovation lies in the better explanation of simulation results and its attractiveness to SCM practitioners. Its theoretical conceptualisation, a logic-based formalisation and the system’s architecture that combines agent technologies with business rules and business process modelling are presented. ...|$|R
