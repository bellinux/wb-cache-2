40|$|We {{present a}} study on four high sedimentation-rate marine cores with {{suppressed}} bioturbation effects, recovered along the northern margin of the eastern Mediterranean. We demonstrate that this region, central to the development <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation,</b> was substantially affected throughout the Holocene by a distinct cycle of cooling events {{on the order of}} 2 o C. In the best-preserved cases the onset of these events appears particularly abrupt, within less than a century. The cooling events typically lasted several centuries, and there are compelling indications that they were associated with increased aridity in the Levantine/NE African sector (Rossignol-Strick, 1995; 1998; Alley et al., 1997; Hassan, 1986; 1996; 1997 a,b; McKim Malville et al., 1998). Several of these episodes appear coincident with cultural reorganisations, with indigenous developments (eg. cattle domestication, new technologies) and population migrations and fusion of peoples and ideas (Hassan, 1986; 1996; 1997 a,b; McKim Malville, 1998). We infer that climatic events of a likely high-latitude origin (O’Brien et al., 1995; Bond et al., 1997; Mayewski et al., 1997; Alley et al., 1997) caused cooling and aridity in and around the eastern Mediterranean via a direct atmospheric link, and therefore {{played an important role in}} the development <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{classical}} {{liberal and}} socialist sympathiser, Oppenheimer regarded capitalism as [...] "a system of exploitation and capital revenues as the gain of that exploitation", but placed the blame {{not on the}} genuinely free market, but on {{the intervention of the}} state. Oppenheimer's view of the state is profoundly opposed to the then dominant characterisation propounded by G. W. F. Hegel of the state as an admirable achievement <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation.</b> Proponents <b>of</b> this view tend to accept the social contract view that the State came about as every larger groups of people agreed to subordinate their private interests for the common good.|$|R

It leads nowhither; it is a shelter hut on the road. The wider movement <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation</b> is against class organisation and caste feeling.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show how both Jan Patočka and Jürgen Habermas, {{starting}} from a reinterpretation of the idea of «lifeworld», engaged a critique <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation,</b> aiming (with different outcomes) at a redefinition of the concept of political community. In order to achieve this goal, I firstly focus on Patočka’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> rational <b>civilisation</b> and its attempt to fix the fracture between «life» and «world». At this stage, I take also advantage of Hans Blumenberg’s distinction between these two terms, in order to better clarify Patočka’s stance on this problem. Secondly, I analyse Habermas’ ideas of lifeworld and system, and their uncoupling in modern societies, as well as the reemergence of this issue in Habermas’ recent works on the European economic and political crisis. Finally, I focus on the very different ways in which Patočka and Habermas tackled the ideas of conflict and crisis in contemporary world, also in view of a possible path out of this crisis through a re-constitution of Europe. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation</b> {{required a}} dual creativity. It required {{not only the}} creation of the artefacts but {{the creation of the}} co-ordinated sensitivity and shared sense of responsibility to live and work together. It comes from what Weber called the Protestant work ethic, which McClelland called the achievement motive, lead by what Maslow called inner-oriented people. The intertwining of technical and moral creative skills has its origins in the training of the masons who built the cathedrals, sees its tightest focus in the people known as Quakers, who were {{at the heart of the}} industrial revolution, and continues today in the art and profession of civil engineering...|$|R

In a 1979 essay, Carr argued about Stalin that: [...] "He revived and outdid the worst brutalities of the earlier Tsars; and his record excited revulsion in later generations of historians. Yet his {{achievement}} in borrowing from the West, in forcing on primitive Russia the material foundations <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation,</b> and in giving Russia a place among the European powers, obliged them to concede, however reluctantly his title to greatness. Stalin was the most ruthless despot Russia had known since Peter, and also a great westerniser".|$|R
60|$|I {{hold that}} the blind {{instincts}} evolved under these long-continued conditions have been ingrained into our breed, {{and that they}} are a bar to our enjoying the freedom which the forms <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation</b> are otherwise capable of giving us. A really intelligent nation might be held together by far stronger forces than are derived from the purely gregarious instincts. A nation need not be a mob of slaves, clinging to one another through fear, {{and for the most part}} incapable of self-government, and begging to be led; but it might consist of vigorous self-reliant men, knit to one [6] another by innumerable ties, into a strong, tense, and elastic organisation.|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of {{advanced}} commercial societies in the West, writers and thinkers have speculated upon and theorised about the relationship between status and happiness. For example, in the eighteenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that the principal source of human unhappiness was our tendency to make invidious comparisons with each other when isolated individuals in the presocial state of nature were forced together by circumstances. This increased proximity fuelled competition for standing in the eyes of others which is the origin of the pervasive unhappiness that he believed was one of the hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation.</b> I argue that this account is partly correct and partly incorrect. On the one hand, there is now substantial credible evidence that supports the view that relative position matters much more to individuals than do absolute levels of wealth. The competition for status that Rousseau saw as a defining feature <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation</b> has left {{the vast majority of people}} much less happy than they would otherwise be by fostering costly expenditure arms races that reduce objective welfare and significantly increase stress and anxiety. On the other hand, there is also mounting evidence that he was wrong that this situation is unnatural. According to some evolutionary biologists, human beings evolved in an environment of scarcity and intense resource competition, where each individual’s position was closely linked to his/her prospects for survival and reproductive success. For most of human history having high relative standing was instrumental in helping individuals to achieve the objectives they instinctively care most deeply about, namely survival and reproductive success...|$|R

50|$|Chew also {{attempts}} to situate the conflict within broader geo-political developments and British geo-strategic calculations. British officials in London, India and the Straits Settlements became increasingly mindful of Asia's strategic importance for trade and industry, {{and the need}} to secure Britain's expanding vital interest in resource-rich areas. This encouraged colonial officials to adopt a more proactive, interventionist approach toward neighbouring Malay kingdoms. Chew also introduces the concept of a British civilising mission, the moral imperative to bring the rule of law, sovereign authority and other norms <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>civilisation</b> to a Malay society perceived as feudal and backward. It added momentum to British forward movements in Naning and the wider peninsula, thus contradicting every preference for cost-cutting non-interference.|$|R
