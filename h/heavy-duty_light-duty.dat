40|$|The {{objective}} of the Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) -sponsored project at Inco's Stobie mine was to conduct a long term field evaluation of diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems available to the underground mining industry. Some of the major issues studied were criteria for selecting the filter media, means of DPF regeneration, efficiency of DPF systems and the occurrence of unwanted secondary emissions, and reliability and durability of DPF systems. Nine state-of-the-art diesel particulate matter (DPM) filtration systems have been retrofitted to <b>heavy-duty</b> and <b>light-duty</b> vehicles and {{have been subjected to}} extensive long-term in-mine evaluation. Periodic efficiency tests were conducted at various stages of the study (2001, 2002 and 2004) to establish in-use efficiencies and durability of the tested DPF systems. The results were used to assess the effects of the filter systems on the concentrations of particulate matter, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide in the vehicle exhaust. The variety of filtration systems and regeneration concepts used in this study offered the opportunity to investigate their advantages and disadvantages. This paper also offers a review of selected experiences with the installation and operation of the DPF systems on underground mining vehicles at the Inco Stobie Mine...|$|R
40|$|Diesel fuel {{injection}} {{is the most}} dominant in ignition process of the diesel engines combustion. Diesel engines {{have been widely used}} in <b>heavy-duty</b> and <b>light-duty</b> vehicles due to their higher fuel economy, efficient and powerful than spark ignition (SI) engines. The principal objective of this research is to seek the effect of temperature and pressure on the spray characteristics, as well as fuel-air mixing characteristics. Experiments were performed in a constant volume chamber at specified ambient gas temperature and pressure. This research was continued with injecting diesel fuel into the chamber using a Bosch common rail system. Direct photography technique with a digital camera was used to clarify the real images of mixture formation such as spray penetration, fuel evaporation and spray interference. The liquid phase of the spray reaches a maximum penetration distance soon after the start of injection, while the vapour phase of the spray continues to penetrate downstream. The condition to which the fuel is affected was estimated by combining information on the wall chamber temperature, ambient temperature and photographs of the spray. The increases in ambient pressure inside the chamber resulting in gain of spray area and wider spray angle. Thus predominantly promotes for a better fuel-air premixin...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{volcanic}} rocks by Neanderthals is frequently {{considered to be}} opportunistic, especially when good-quality stones were rare in the site neighbourhood. An analysis of the lithic series made {{of volcanic}} rocks discovered in the Middle Palaeolithic sites of Payre and Sainte-Anne I, located in the south part and at the southeastern margin of the Massif Central of France and dated back to MIS 7 up {{until the end of}} MIS 5, illustrates the capacity of Neanderthals to manage these raw materials and enables us to compare the strategies used in two different mineral environments. Shaping and flaking reduction sequences coexist in both sites in varying proportions, depending on the available rocks in the surroundings. At Payre, artefacts made of volcanic rocks are rarer in surroundings rich in flint while at Sainte-Anne I, the different series comprise a large quantity of artefacts made of different basalts and trachy-phonolites in an environment relatively poor in flint. Most of the reduction processes took place in situ. Activities outside the sites only appear to have concerned the shaping of some heavy-duty tools and some large flakes. It is likely that volcanic rocks were considered by Neanderthals as a geo-resource, either major or lesser in importance, to provide large flakes and both <b>heavy-duty</b> and <b>light-duty</b> tools, besides flint quartz and other rocks...|$|R

Flywheel systems can be implemented with either an electrical or a mechanical powertrain. The assessment elaborates upon flywheel rotor design issues of stress, materials and aspect ratio. Twelve organizations that produce flywheel systems submitted specifications for flywheel energy storage systems to meet minimum energy and power requirements for both <b>light-duty</b> and <b>heavy-duty</b> hybrid applications of interest to DOE. The most extensive experience operating flywheel high power energy storage systems in <b>heavy-duty</b> and <b>light-duty</b> hybrid vehicles is in Europe. Recent advances in Europe in a number of vehicle racing venues and also in road car advanced evaluations are discussed. As a frame of reference, nominal weight and specific power for non-energy storage components of Toyota hybrid electric vehicles are summarized. The most effective utilization of flywheels is in providing high power while providing just enough energy storage to accomplish the power assist mission effectively. Flywheels are shown to meet or exceed the USABC power related goals (discharge power, regenerative power, specific power, power density, weight and volume) for HEV and EV batteries and ultracapacitors. The greatest technical challenge facing the developer of vehicular flywheel systems remains the issue of safety and containment.

40|$|This paper investigates how California {{may reduce}} {{transportation}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 (i. e., 80 in 50). A Kaya framework that decomposes greenhouse gas emissions into the product of population, transport intensity, energy intensity, and carbon intensity is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. Each transportation subsector, including <b>light-duty,</b> <b>heavy-duty,</b> aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, and off-road vehicles, is analyzed to identify specific mitigation options and understand its potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scenario analysis shows that, while California’s 2050 target is ambitious, it can be achieved in transport if a concerted effort is made to change travel behavior and the vehicles and fuels that provide mobility. While no individual ‘‘Silver Bullet” strategy exists that can achieve the goals, a portfolio approach that combines strategies could yield success. The 80 in 50 scenarios show the impacts of advanced vehicle and fuels technologies {{as well as the}} role of travel demand reduction, which can significantly reduce energy and resource requirements and the level of technology development needed to meet the target...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} major {{contributors}} {{of various types}} of air polluting exhaust gasses such as Particulate Matter (PM), Carbon monoxide (CO), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulfur, and other harmful compounds. It {{has been shown that}} formation of these air pollutants can be significantly reduced by blending oxygenates into the base diesel. Ethanol blended diesel (e-diesel) is a cleaner burning alternative to regular diesel for both <b>heavy-duty</b> (HD) and <b>light-duty</b> (LD) compression ignition (CI) engines used in buses, trucks, off-road equipment, and passenger cars. Although ethanol {{has been used as a}} fuel oxygenate to reduce tail-pipe emissions in gasoline, its use in diesel has not been possible due to technical limitations (i. e., blending). Commercially viable E-Diesel is now possible due to the development of an additive system, Puranol, invented by Pure Energy Corporation (PEC). Puranol allows the splash blending of ethanol in diesel in a clear solution possible for the first time. Laboratory and field tests have demonstrated over 41 % reduction in PM, 27 % reduction in CO, and 5 % reduction in NOx from a HD diesel engine. Significantly higher emissions reductions are observed from smaller 1. 9 -L VW TDI engines...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} computationally efficient {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of {{top dead centre}} (TDC) offset and pressure offset is presented. It is based on characteristic deviations of {{the rate of heat}} release (ROHR) that are specific for both offsets in compression phase and expansion phase after the end of combustion. These characteristic deviations of the ROHR are derived from first principles and they were also confirmed through manual shifts of the pressure trace. The ROHR is calculated based on the first law of thermodynamics using an in-cylinder pressure trace, engine geometrical parameters and operating point specific parameters. The method can be applied in off-line analyses using an averaged pressure trace or in on-line analyses using a single pressure trace. In both application areas the method simultaneously determines the TDC position and the pressure offset within a single processing of the pressure trace, whereas a second refinement step can be performed for obtaining more accurate results as correction factors are determined more accurately using nearly converged input data. Innovative analytic basis of the method allows for significant reduction of the computational times compared to the existing methods for the simultaneous determination of TDC offset and pressure offset in fired conditions. The method was validated on a <b>heavy-duty</b> and a <b>light-duty</b> diesel engine...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMenez-Dregan I is a Lower Palaeolithic site {{situated}} at Plouhinec, Finistère, in Brittany. It {{is an ancient}} marine cave whose roof has gradually collapsed. Layer 4 {{from the site of}} Menez-Dregan I is the last occupation of this deposit, at the boundary between the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic. Geological correlations tend to place layer 4 in MIS 9 or 7, although the only TL dating obtained for this level gave an age of 223  ±  23  ka. This study focuses on the lithic industry from the 1991 – 2004 excavations and was undertaken in order to capture the various types of technical behaviour that could illustrate the transition between the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic. We present the lithic industry of this layer, which simultaneously combines Lower Palaeolithic characteristics, such as large quantities of pebble tools (due to the environment of the site), and the emergence of characteristics that are common to the Middle Palaeolithic, such as standardisation of flake production, or adapting knapping methods to the dimensions of the raw materials (discoid knapping for quartzite, bipolar flaking on an anvil for small flint pebbles). The lithic industry from layer 4 and its three levels (4 a, 4 b and 4 c) has been analysed. Layer 4 of Menez-Dregan I has been attributed to the “Colombanian” {{on the basis of the}} composition of its lithic industry: a predominance of cobble tools amongst <b>heavy-duty</b> tools, retouched <b>light-duty</b> tools on flake-supports comprising mostly notches and denticulates, and a knapping method akin to the “SSDA – Clactonian”. The Levallois method is absent, bifaces are absent or extremely rare, and there are few scrapers. The Colombanian proves to be a Lower Palaeolithic industry contemporary with the classic Acheulean, but typologically distinct. However, standardisation of flake production leads us to foresee a change in the lithic industry of layer 4, and highlights a transitional period from the Lower Palaeolithic to the Middle Palaeolithic in the latest occupation of this deposit. This study is a contribution to the documentation of the diversity and variability of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic lithic industries, demonstrating that the large amount of cobble tools in layer 4 is an unchanged component due to environmental constraints...|$|R
40|$|Research into {{alternative}} fuels is necessitated by our {{heavy reliance on}} limited oil reserves and increasingly strict emissions legislation. The studies reported in this thesis involved conducting engine tests using alternatives to fossil Diesel fuel in both <b>heavy-duty</b> and <b>light-duty</b> single cylinder engines. The combustion modes considered were conventional Diesel combustion and two more advanced modes: low temperature combustion (LTC) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Both Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Fatty Acid Methyl Esther (FAME) fuels were considered; in both cases, the formation of emissions, fuel consumption and combustion behavior were compared to those of conventional Diesel fuels. The overall objectives of these studies were {{to determine whether it}} is possible to operate conventional Diesel engines with the {{alternative fuels}} and to operate the engines in a fashion that will minimize the emissions of species covered by legislation such as soot and NOx. It was also expected that the results obtained would provide new insights into soot and NOx formation when burning alternative fuels in a Diesel engine. The first experiments were performed in a light-duty engine with Fischer-Tropsch fuels, Swedish environmental class 1 (MK 1) and European Diesel (EN 590), using both conventional and HCCI combustion. In the conventional Diesel combustion mode, {{it was found that the}} soot emissions were up to 30 percent lower than those obtained using MK 1. It was further seen that the high cetane number of the tested F-T fuels reduced the ignition delay and over-leaning, which resulted in lower HC emissions. Despite the high cetane number of the F-T fuels, HCCI combustion could be achieved with increased levels of EGR. The FT fuels are less dense than conventional Diesel fuel, which may reduce the extent of spray-wall interactions and would thus reduce CO emissions. The FT fuels had heating values that were similar to those for conventional Diesel fuels and therefore exhibited comparable specific fuel consumption. In the heavy-duty engine tests, the FT fuels yielded soot emissions that were up to 60 percent lower than those for MK 1 Diesel. However, there was no clear difference between the two in terms of NOx emissions, which appeared to be more sensitive to the engine’s operating parameters than to the nature of the fuel. For example, they could be reduced by up to 90 percent by increasing the level of EGR from 0 to 40 %. The FAME fuels also yielded very substantially lower soot emissions than European Diesel in the heavy-duty engine, being up to 90 % lower for the FAME fuels. This was attributed to the absence of aromatics (which are precursors in soot formation) in the alternative fuels and to the high oxygen content of the FAME fuels. In addition, the flame lift-off was longer for FAME fuels, which improves the mixing of fuel and air and thus generates lower soot emissions. Unfortunately, the FAME fuel also yielded NOx emissions that were up to 20 % higher than those for conventional Diesel, which was partially due to the FAME flame temperature being 40 °C higher than that for Diesel fuel. The oxygen content of the FAME fuels also gave leaner fuel-air mixtures and thus higher NOx emissions. When assessing alternative fuels, it is important to consider ethical and environmental factors throughout their entire lifecycle and also to be aware that there is unlikely to be a single alternative that can fully replace all fossil fuels currently in use...|$|R
40|$|Lean NOx {{reduction}} over silver-alumina from lab-scale to real conditions Effects {{of reducing}} agent and catalyst composition FREDRIK GUNNARSSON Applied surface chemistry Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Chalmers University of Technology Abstract The {{focus of this}} work {{is to increase the}} understanding of lean NOx reduction over silver-alumina catalysts using hydrocarbons as the reducing agent (HC-SCR), in particular by investigating the effect of silver loading, the role of platinum doping, and the effect of the type of reducing agent. In addition, the effects of aging and hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic activity and selectivity, and the influence of real engine exhausts were investigated, with special attention to the low-temperature activity. Silver-alumina samples were prepared using a sol-gel method, including freeze-drying, and evaluated for HC-SCR. The samples were synthesized with varying silver loading, with and without addition of trace amounts of platinum. NOx reduction activity studies, hydrothermal treatment and oxidation experiments were performed in a synthetic gas bench reactor using model hydrocarbons (n-octane, ethane, ethene, ethyne) and commercially available biofuels (NExBTL, ethanol) as the reducing agent. The samples were characterized with respect to surface area (BET) as well as the type and relative amount of surface silver species (UV-vis, XPS). An optimized catalyst was also up-scaled and investigated in an engine bench reactor, with diesel exhausts, using a commercial biofuel as reducing agent, and with hydrogen supplied via a reformer catalyst. The results show that silver-alumina catalysts, prepared via sol-gel synthesis, display a high consistency regarding surface area and the relative amount of different silver species, as the silver loading is varied. Furthermore, it can be observed that activation for hydrocarbon oxidation generally proceeds more easily with increasing bond order of the hydrocarbon. For instance, the use of hydrocarbons with high bond order, e. g. ethyne, as reductant for NOx, results not only in the highest peak activity for lean NOx reduction but also in considerable high activity in a wide temperature range mainly thanks to increased activity at low temperatures compared to a corresponding hydrocarbon with lower bond order. With increasing silver loading, the oxidation reactions are favored such that both the hydrocarbon and the NO activation occur at lower temperatures. This is also corroborated by experiments with oxidized hydrocarbons (ethanol) displaying a complete reduction of NOx over a wide temperature range. As the hydrocarbon chain-length is increased, the NOx reduction decreases, however, high activity can be seen even when using the commercial biodiesel, with a reduction of over 70 % in laboratory scale experiments. Furthermore, it is concluded that as the samples are doped with trace-amounts of platinum, the activity for lean NOx reduction at low temperatures is enhanced when using n-octane. The catalyst composition showing the highest activity for NOx reduction, using n-octane as reducing agent, is found to be a 2 wt. % Ag/Al 2 O 3 sample doped with 500 ppm platinum. This catalyst also displays the highest low-temperature activity, most likely owing to an increased ability to partially oxidize the hydrocarbon reductant as well as higher adsorption of the hydrocarbon on the surface, attributed to the Pt doping. The 4 wt. % Ag/Al 2 O 3 sample doped with 100 ppm platinum shows high activity in close to real conditions with the addition of reformate. It can also be concluded that adding reformate instead of pure hydrogen, to the same H 2 concentration, results in an equal or even higher activity for NOx reduction, likely owing to the presence of unreacted hydrocarbons in the reformate. In conclusion this work shows HC-SCR as a viable concept for NOx reduction, even though many challenges remain. Low-level platinum doping is shown to increase the activity for NOx reduction, especially at low temperatures and for higher hydrocarbons. In addition, the in-house synthesized catalysts are compatible with commercial biofuels for both <b>heavy-duty</b> (NExBTL) and <b>light-duty</b> (ethanol) vehicles. The real engine experiments also show a promising NOx reduction, both when using pure hydrogen and reformate...|$|R
