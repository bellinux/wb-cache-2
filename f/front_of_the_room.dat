In some temples, the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is separated with walls and several altars are placed in the alcoves. The statues on the altars are usually in pairs, each god with his consort (Radha-Krishna, Sita-Rama, Shiva-Parvati). However, some gods, such as Ganesha and Hanuman, are placed alone. Ritual items such as flowers or lamps may be placed on the altar.|$|E

Therefore, as George Washington stated, the {{document}} was executed by [...] "eleven states, and Colonel Hamilton."

It was soon interrupted by Greenpeace activist Gord Perks, who arrived with a briefcase handcuffed to his arm, with a tape recorder inside playing a pre-recorded list of broken Liberal environmental promises.

60|$|Rollo {{looked about}} upon the pier a few minutes, {{and then went}} into the hotel. He passed through a spacious hall, and then through a passage way, from which he could look into a large room, the sides of which were formed of glass, so {{that the people who}} were in the room could see out all around them. The <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> looked out upon the pier, the back side upon the passage way. A third side was toward the vestibule, and the fourth toward the coffee room. There were shelves around this room, within, and tables, and desks, and people going to and fro there. In fact, it seemed to be the office of the hotel.|$|E

With a set expression which showed what an effort she was making, Katharine encountered their eyes, and saying, [...] "We're {{not going to}} interrupt you," [...] she led Denham behind the curtain which hung in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with the relics. This refuge was none of her willing, but confronted with wet pavements and only some belated museum or Tube station for shelter, she was forced, for Ralph's sake, to face the discomforts of her own house.

60|$|The {{furniture}} was old, {{and perhaps a}} trifle shabby, but it was of beautiful design. Curtains, carpets and tinted walls formed a harmony of soft coloring, and there were scattered here and there dainty works of art, little statuettes from Italy, and wonderful Indian ivory and silver work. A row of low, stone-ribbed windows pierced the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Looking out he saw the trim garden lying in the warm evening light. Immediately beneath the windows ran a broad graveled terrace, which was evidently raked smooth every day, and a row of urns in which hyacinths bloomed stood upon its pillared wall. From {{the middle of the}} terrace a wide stairway led down to the wonderful velvet lawn, which was dotted with clumps of cupressus with golden gleams in it, and beyond the lawn clipped yews rose smooth and solid as a rampart of stone.|$|E
