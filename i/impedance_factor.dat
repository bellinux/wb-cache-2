40|$|The {{diffusion}} of small-molecule penetrants in polyethylene is hindered by impenetrable crystals {{and by the}} segmental constraints imposed by the crystals on the penetrable phase. Liquid and vapour n-hexane sorption/desorption measurements were performed on metallocene catalyzed homogenous poly(ethylene-co-octene) s. It was shown that the fractional free volume of the polymer penetrable component increased with increasing amount of penetrable polymer. It also increased with the relative proportion of liquid-like component in the penetrable polymer fraction. The detour effect was found to increase with decreasing crystallinity. The experimental study of the morphology of the polymers showed that the geometrical <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> followed the same trend with increasing crystallinity as the data obtained from n-hexane desorption. The changes in phase composition and character upon n-hexane sorption were monitored with Raman spectroscopy, WAXS and NMR spectroscopy. Partial dissolution of the orthorhombic and the interfacial component was observed upon nhexane sorption. Changes {{in the character of}} the components were furthermore analyzed: an increase of the density in the crystalline component and a decrease of the density in the amorphous component were observed in the n-hexane-sorbed-samples. Molecular dynamics simulations were used for studying {{diffusion of}} n-hexane in fully amorphous poly(ethylene-co-octene) s. The branches in poly(ethylene-co-octene) decreased the density by affecting the packing of the chains in the rubbery state in accordance with experimental data. Diffusion of n-hexane at low penetrant concentration showed unexpectedly that the penetrant diffusivity decreased with increasing degree of branching. Spherulitic growth was mimicked with an algorithm able to generate structures comparable to those observed in polyethylene. The diffusion in the simulated structure was assessed with Monte Carlo simulations of random walks and the geometrical <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> of the spherulitic structures was calculated and compared with analytical values according to Fricke’s theory. The linear relationship between geometrical <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> and crystallinity in Fricke’s theory was confirmed. Fricke’s theory, however, underestimated the crystal blocking effect. By modelling systems having a distribution of crystal width-to-thickness ratio it was proven that wide crystals had a more pronounced effect on the geometrical <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> than is indicated by their number fraction weight.

The results indicated that stiffness and viscosity decrease when the arm is raised and increase when it is lowered, showing the same tendency as mean blood pressure. However, the changes of the proposed nonlinear viscoelastic parameter are smaller (P < 0. 05) than those of the linear model.

40|$|Experimental {{and field}} data {{have shown that}} large amounts of water can be redistributed from warmer soils to and behind an {{advancing}} freezing front. The mechanisms by which this occurs are becoming more understood, but the most appropriate method for analysing these mechanisms is not yet known. Various researchers have developed soil freezing models, but they are all limited to some extent and are not practical tools from a design or predictive modelling perspective. The objective of this research program is to develop unsaturated soil freezing theory from a geotechnical engineering perspective, and to verify the theory by modifying an existing non-freezing soil heat and mass transfer model. In this study the SoilCover (MEND, 1993) model is modified to verify the theory and numerical solution. SoilCover (MEND, 1993) is a one-dimensional soil heat flow and mass transfer computer model used for designing protective covers over waste rock and tailings. These covers, if they remain saturated, significantly reduce oxygen infiltration into the waste material where it can combine with water to produce acid mine drainage. SoilCover (MEND, 1993) is not capable of modelling through the winter months when upper regions of the covers become subjected to freezing temperatures. Unique to the modified soil freezing model is the method by which the coupled heat and mass equations are combined and solved. The numerical model uses a single, unique expression which describes the heat flow, mass transfer, and phase change phenomenon in the frozen or partially frozen soil zones. To derive the modified equation, the dependent suction variable in the mass transfer equation is re-written {{as a function of}} freezing point depression temperature using a Clapeyron type relationship that is obtained by combining soil freezing curve data with soil water characteristic curve data. The mass transfer equation is then re-written as a function of change in ice content and substituted into the ice content term of the heat transfer equation. The result is a single combined heat and mass transfer equation with one unknown variable, i. e., temperature. Once new temperatures are solved for over the current time step, suctions and ice contents are computed using back-substitution. The revised model was verified using laboratory freezing test data collected at the University of Saskatchewan in 1977. During laboratory data modelling of three freezing tests, the average percent difference between measured and computed frost front positions was approximately 6 %. The average difference between measured and computed ice contents was approximately 7 %, and the average difference between measured and computed liquid water contents was approximately 14 %. These discrepancies were primarily due to errors in the estimated and measured soil thermal and hydraulic property functions. Results of the laboratory data simulations suggest that the permeability versus suction relationship for an unsaturated soil also applies as soil pore-water freezes. This finding is contrary to the findings of other researchers who had to introduce an arbitrary ice <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> to make computed and measured ice contents agree. The ice <b>impedance</b> <b>factor</b> has the effect of reducing the permeability by several orders of magnitude as the volumetric pore-ice content increases. In this study, good agreement between computed and measured ice contents was obtained without the use of an <b>impedance</b> <b>factor.</b> To demonstrate an application of the revised model, a simulation of freezing and thawing in a soil cover system was carried out and compared to field data collected during the winter of 1993 / 1994 at a silver mine near Houston, B. C. For comparisons between the field data and simulations, the soil surface temperature beneath the snow pack had to be estimated as the numerical model does not account for heat and mass flux through snow layers.

The ranking of mechanisms was performed by simulating the Cd 2 + uptake by 1 cm 2 root for 30 days for French agricultural soil characteristics.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted via replacing the new soil hydraulic property scheme in CLM 4. 5 by the old one, using default CLM 4. 5 runs as reference. Results indicated that the new parameterization scheme ameliorated the surface dry biases at ZS but enlarged the wet biases which existed at GS site due to ignoring the gravel effect. The wetter surface condition in CLM 4. 5 also leads to a warmer surface soil temperature because of the greater heat capacity of liquid water. In addition, the combined impact of new soil hydraulic property schemes and the ice impedance function on the simulated soil moisture lead to the more reasonable simulation of the starting dates of freeze-thaw cycle, especially at the thawing stage. The improvements also lead to the more reasonable turbulent fluxes simulations. Meanwhile, the decreased snow cover fraction in CLM 4. 5 resulted in a lower albedo, which tended to increase net surface radiation compared to previous versions.

Few Land Surface Models (LSMs) and Hydrological Models (HMs) have been developed, adapted or tested for frozen conditions and permafrost soils. Considering the vast geographical area influenced by freeze/thaw processes and permafrost, and the rapid environmental change observed worldwide in these regions, a need exists to improve models to better represent their hydrology. In this study, various infiltration algorithms and parameterisation methods, which are commonly employed in current LSMs and HMs were tested against detailed measurements at three sites in Canada's discontinuous permafrost region with organic soil depths ranging from 0. 02 to 3 m. Field data from two consecutive years were used to calibrate and evaluate the infiltration algorithms and parameterisations.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the influential mechanisms governing the phytoavailability of the toxic trace element cadmium (Cd) in agricultural soils using a mechanistic model. We built a phytoavailability model simulating the Cd 2 + uptake by 1 cm² root surface {{and including the}} transport by diffusion and convection, the kinetics of sorption/desorption and of complexation with the dissolved soil organic matter. The model variables were ranked by performing a sensitivity analysis where a 30 -days uptake of Cd 2 + was simulated for 100 000 combinations of the parameters chosen within ranges consistent with the French agricultural soils. Generally, the most influential variable was the initial concentration of Cd 2 +, which was low, making the root capacity for absorbing Cd 2 + of little influence. The convection was almost always negligible and the diffusion was the dominant process of Cd phytoavailability. The soil <b>impedance</b> <b>factor,</b> the water content and more particularly the soil buffer power for Cd 2 + were therefore the following most influential variables. The kinetics of adsorption and desorption were of little Influence. The Cd-complex was shown to generally contribute little to the uptake due to a strong kinetic limitation for the dissociation. Consequently, the dominant process buffering the Cd 2 + concentration at the root surface was desorption. Significant complex contributions were observed for very labile complex and high water flux toward the root surface. On the whole, the simulated uptake correlated very well with a simplified model considering only the transport and sorption at equilibrium of Cd 2 +. This model relied on the total soil Cd concentration, the soil pH, the soil organic carbon content, the concentrations of calcium and dissolved organic matter, and the partitioning of the dissolved organic matter between fulvic and humic acids; these variables determined the soil/solution partitioning of Cd 2 +...|$|E
