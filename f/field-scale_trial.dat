40|$|Forest fires pose {{a serious}} threat to {{countries}} in the Mediterranean basin, often razing large areas of land each year. After fires, soils are more likely to erode and resilience is inhibited in part by the toxic aromatic hydrocarbons produced during the combustion of cellulose and lignins. In this study, we explored the use of bioremediation and rhizoremediation tech-niques for soil restoration in a <b>field-scale</b> <b>trial</b> in a protected Mediterranean ecosystem after a controlled fire. Our bioremediation strategy combined the use of Pseudomonas putida strains, indigenous culturable microbes and annual grasses. After 8 months of monitoring soil quality parameters, including the removal of monoaromatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as vegetation cover, we found that the site had returned to pre-fire status. Microbial population analysis revealed that fires induced changes in the indigenous microbiota and that rhizoremediation favours the recovery of soil microbiota in time. The results obtained in this study indicate that the rhizoremediation strategy could be presented as a viable and cost-effective alternative for the treatment of ecosystems affected by fires...|$|E

We used data from a multi-year <b>field-scale</b> <b>trial</b> in Kings County and related container trials to simulate a forage-grazing system under saline conditions. The model uses rainfall and irrigation water amounts, irrigation water quality, soil, plant, and atmospheric variables to predict Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) growth, quality, and use by cattle. Simulations based on field measurements and a related container study indicate that although soil chemical composition is affected by irrigation water quality, irrigation timing and frequency {{can be used to}} mitigate salt and trace mineral accumulation. Bermuda grass yields of up to 12 Mg dry matter (DM) ·ha− 1 were observed at the field site and predicted by the model. Forage yield and quality supports un-supplemented cattle stocking rates of 1. 0 to 1. 2 animal units (AU) ·ha− 1. However, a balance must be achieved between stocking rate, desired average daily gain, accumulation of salts in the soil profile, and potential pollution of ground water from drainage and leaching. Using available weather data, crop-specific parameter values and field scale measurements of soil salinity and nitrogen levels, the model can be used by farmers growing forages on saline soils elsewhere, to sustain forage and livestock production under similarly marginal conditions...|$|E

Two OMF formulations were tested: OMF 15 (15 : 4 : 4) and OMF 10 (10 : 4 : 4) which were compared with urea and biosolids granules applied to a grass crop {{over a period of}} two years. The fertilisers were applied at N rates in the range of 0 (control) to 250 kg ha- 1 at regular increments of 50 kg ha- 1. Results showed that the calculated agronomic efficiencies with OMF were in the range of 25 to 35 kg kg- 1 which were approximately double than those of biosolids and comparable to those obtained with urea (range of 30 to 37 kg kg- 1). Olsen's P in OMF-treated soil did not show significant changes (P> 0. 05); therefore, soil P Index was not affected. This result supported the reasons for the proposed OMF formulations and demonstrated the advantage of the products compared with biosolids which resulted in significant (P< 0. 05) increases in Olsen's P. It was also demonstrated that the application of OMF at rates equivalent to the optimum N rate for the grass-soil system should not induce significant changes in soil P Index in the longer-term including application to soils with already satisfactory P levels. Fertiliser application strategies (N rates and timing of OMF application) are discussed which will enhance agronomic and environmental performance. ...|$|E

However, the application of biochar to agricultural land must have few if any negative economic and environmental consequences if farmers are to readily adopt biochar as soil amendment. Biochar use as an organic amendment has been recently rising due to its positive effect on soil fertility, {{but there is still}} limited information available about longer-term effects, especially with regard to the effects on soil pollutant content and distribution. In a <b>field-scale</b> <b>trial</b> we investigated the effect of single doses of biochar (25 and 50 t ha- 1) and repeat-applications (two years later) of biochar (25 + 25 and 50 + 50 t ha- 1) on heavy metal (As, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni) content and distribution in soil, together with metal concentrations in plants (barley, beans) over repeated cropping cycles. Here we demonstrate that biochar produced from forest residues is of a low risk due to its inherently low metal content and the lack of observed negative effects on crop or soil quality. Although biochar did cause small changes in metal fractionation in soil, it did not alter total metal concentrations in soil or plants. We conclude that the application of wood-derived biochar does not increase the concentrations of metals in this soil, even after repeated applications, and could be safely used for agriculture...|$|E

Release of microorganisms as bioaerosols during waste collection and processing may be an occupational risk to workers within the industry. There may be many constituents of the bioaerosol that may be of concern, however, there are currently only workplace exposure limits proposed for endotoxin (90 EU m - 3). A <b>field-scale</b> <b>trial</b> was established to determine the concentration of mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, thermotolerant fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, endotoxin and (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan in air within bins containing either bagged or loose residual waste, in warm (23 °C) or cold (7 °C) conditions, to simulate an extended collection cycle. Fresh waste was added during the first four weeks, with an additional ‘missed collection’ phase of a further four weeks where no more waste was added. A second trial examined the microbiological components of bioaerosols associated with ‘tipping’ the bins, simulating the moment when bins are emptied into waste collection vehicles. The majority of mesophilic bacteria, fungi and A. fumigatus concentrations were recorded when fresh material was added to the bins, with only mesophilic bacteria recorded up to week 6 during the ‘missed collection’ phase. (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan concentrations were variable throughout the first trial, (geometric mean range 0. 4 - 13. 8 ng m - 3). Perhaps the bioaerosol component of most interest was endotoxin (geometric mean range 0. 52 - 1288 EU m- 3). Elevated endotoxin concentrations were recorded during the ‘missed collection’ phase of the extended collection cycle and during ‘tipping’. This data demonstrates significant concentrations of bioaerosols and particularly endotoxin can be generated during prolonged residual waste storage and collection. As endotoxin is a bioaerosol component of concern it can be concluded there is the potential for workplace exposure hence identifying key areas for risk assessment...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between farmland bird populations and agricultural intensification {{has been well}} studied. However, the impact of variation in soil conditions and soil management is an exception, especially in upland (sub-alpine) farming systems. In this study, we examined the relationships between liming history, soil pH and patterns of foraging by Northern Lapwing,Vanellus vanellus, chicks {{in order to test}} the potential utility of soil amendment as a conservation intervention for shorebirds nesting in agricultural grasslands. Limed fields had higher soil pH than unlimed fields, and soil pH declined with the number of years since a field was last limed. The most important predictor of total earthworm abundance was soil organic matter with very few earthworms in peats of very high organic matter content. However, there was a marked additive effect of soil pH with earthworms more than twice as abundant at high (pH 6. 0) as at the low (pH 3. 5) extremes of soil pH recorded in the study. Specifically, at Lapwing chick foraging locations, the density ofAllolobophora chlorotica, an acid-intolerant species of earthworm found just {{below the surface of the}} soil, was significantly higher than at randomly selected locations. These results suggest that liming helped to maintain breeding habitat quality for Lapwings and other species dependent on earthworms. This is of conservation significance in upland agricultural grasslands in the UK, where there has been a long-term reduction in agricultural lime use since the mid- 20 th century. <b>Field-scale</b> <b>trials</b> of liming would be valuable to test whether targetted amendment of soil pH in agriculturally improved grasslands could retain an important role in conservation management for shorebirds in upland landscapes where geology, high rainfall, and leaching tend to acidify soils over time...|$|R

40|$|The new pest, Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), poses a {{formidable}} threat to blueberry growers and other thin-skinned fruit growers in the United States. It lays its eggs inside of ripening fruit, rendering the berries unsalable. The yield loss due to SWD damage has already caused considerable economic impact since its {{arrival in the}} United States in 2008. It was found in Vermont in 2011, where blueberries are an important crop, and as such, growers need support adapting their management strategies. Fine mesh netting {{can be used to}} physically exclude the fly from ripe blueberries. This is a promising option for Organic growers, who are limited to only one effective, Organic-approved chemical control. Netting could represent one more tool in an integrated pest management program. Given the novelty of the emergent SWD situation, little research had previously been done to answer questions surrounding netting technology in the context of blueberry growing. This project sought to answer the questions: What are the advantages and challenges of using insect netting on blueberries? What would be an ideal way to trellis netting over a support-structure? What are some practical, relevant pieces of information that other farmers have to offer about this technology? In researching these questions, the goal was to address the lack of information about using physical control as a management strategy to protect small- and medium-sized blueberry farms from SWD. It was found that the major challenges were how netting limited access to the blueberry field, altered the harvest experience, and could be hard to handle. Some advantages found were its potential ability to exclude other wildlife pests, and how it may ripen the berries earlier. However, these two advantages need to be researched further for verification. Similarly, the project produced three suggestions for how to trellis the netting on supportive structures. A field scale trial would be needed to validate these suggestions. Lastly, an outreach document was prepared that included the three suggested support-structure designs, information about available insect netting brands, and some practical advice gathered from farmers over the course of this research. Of great benefit to this growing body of research would be a <b>field-scale</b> <b>trial</b> that tested the suggested support-structure designs, studied the two previously mentioned advantages, and developed an in-depth cost-benefit analysis of fine mesh exclusion netting for small- and medium-sized blueberry operations in Vermont...|$|E

40|$|Fertilizer {{nitrogen}} (N) {{usually is}} applied to Iowa cornfields before planting in late April or early May. Although it is well established that some of this N can escape from fields before the corn (Zea mays L.) begins rapid growth in June, the practical importance of these early season losses of N has not been established. This dissertation focused on {{learning more about the}} importance of early season N losses during corn production in Iowa. Three studies were conducted. The first involved a survey-type approach using the late-spring test for soil nitrate and the end-of-season test for cornstalk nitrate in hundreds of fields managed by farmers. The tests were performed over an eight-year period, and both tests showed a strong negative correlation between mean annual nitrate concentrations and March [...] May rainfall. The second involved coordinated field trials and laboratory incubations to characterize effects of the organic and inorganic N fractions of animal manure on N supplies for crop growth. The results indicate that early season losses of inorganic N should be considered a major factor determining the effects of the manure. The third study involved use of precision farming technologies in <b>field-scale</b> <b>trials</b> to evaluate the importance of N losses when farmers apply N only in the fall. The importance was evaluated by applying extra N in strips and measuring crop responses to this N. Large responses to the extra N were detected, and these responses suggest that losses of fall-applied N resulted in severe N deficiencies and costly yield reductions. The results of each study provided compelling evidence that early season losses of N are important during corn production in Iowa and that these losses could be substantially reduced by delaying N fertilization until plants are growing. The benefits of this change would include greater profits for producers and less environmental degradation associated with losses of N from fields. The results suggest that these benefits could be obtained if farmers used the new soil and tissue tests in organized programs designed to evaluate and improve the outcomes of N management on their fields...|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} with controlled traffic {{has been}} suggested as one way to improve water infiltration and reduce soil losses in irrigated annual crops in Mediterranean environments, but little research is available. In 2009, we compared two soil-management systems for a maize (Zea mays L.) -cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cropping system in Córdoba (Southern Spain) : permanent beds with crop-residue retention on surface ground (PB) and conventionally tilled beds (tilled with a disc harrow, then a chisel plough and rotavator before bed forming) with residues incorporated into the soil (CB). The soil was a loamy alluvial Typic Xerofluvent. Traffic was controlled and two types of furrows were distinguished in each tillage system: with (+T) and without (-T) wheel traffic. We hypothesized that PB combined with controlled traffic could reduce soil erosion and enhance infiltration compared to CB. The effects on soil erosion caused by sprinkler irrigation or rainfall events were evaluated at field-scale (water application intensities of 0. 26 and 0. 30 mmmin- 1 in Trial 1 and Trial 2, respectively) and with a rainfall-simulator (mini-plots 0. 9 m× 0. 9 m in size and a water application intensity of 1 mmmin- 1), respectively. In irrigation Trial 1 (on bare soil), soil loss in PB+T furrows was 4 gm- 2, about one-ninth that in CB+T furrows. -T furrows did not produce runoff in this trial. In irrigation Trial 2 (on soil covered by a cotton crop), soil loss in CB (59 gm- 2) was double that in PB, and in +T it was about three times that in -T (64 gm- 2 vs. 23 gm- 2). The results obtained using intense simulated rainfall at the mini-plot scale showed similar relative differences to those obtained from the irrigation trials at the field scale, except that the protective effect on the soil of the crop residues in PB was more noticeable than in the irrigation trials. Complementary trials using mini-ring infiltrometers (9. 6 cm in diameter), aimed at characterizing small-scale infiltration variability, i. e., differences between beds and furrows, gave highly variable results, sometimes contradicting those obtained from the mini-plot and <b>field-scale</b> <b>trials.</b> The results are valid for the Mediterranean environment where {{the study was conducted}} but should motivate similar research in other environments where agricultural systems are susceptible to rain- or irrigation-induced soil erosion. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Animal production, {{especially}} swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) and poultry, {{has increased}} in the United States prompting the need to manage the larger volume of manure beyond land applications to supply nitrogen (N) for corn (Zea mays) production. Applying swine manure to soybean (Glycine max) {{has been shown to}} increase grain yield due to N supply. The goal of this research was to determine if swine manure applications to double-crop soybean following wheat can limit manure N loading to the soil by extending management options, increase soybean biomass and grain production, and increase N removal rates. Manure N availability to soybean and potential manure N loss were also to be determined. Four <b>field-scale</b> <b>trials</b> were initiated in 2012 near Russiaville, IN and Farmland, IN and in 2013 near Farmersburg, IN and Fort Branch, IN. Three rates of swine manure were applied that ranged from 116 to 599 kg N ha - 1 depending on location. Fertilizer UAN was also applied at 168, 336, and 504 kg N ha - 1, and an untreated control (UTC) was included to total seven treatments. Biomass and nutrient accumulations were determined with plant samples at full bloom (R 2) and full seed (R 6), and grain subsamples at harvest. Soil N was determined for the 0 to 30 and 30 to 60 cm depths at R 2 and post-harvest, and soils were incubated at 25 ¢aC and - 0. 33 bar water content for zero, four, eight, and sixteen (2012 only) weeks. Swine manure application increased soybean grain yield in conjunction with increased application rates in 2012 at Russiaville. This increase of yield was preceded by increased biomass accumulation at R 2, but N application generally did not affect biomass accumulation at R 6. All treatments supplied more N in the top 60 cm of soil after harvest compared to the UTC. In 2013, effects of swine manure application to soybean were negligible to negative. At Farmersburg, grain yield was negatively affected by manure application, and significant amounts of soil N were present after harvest in the manure-amended plots. At Fort Branch, biomass, grain yield, grain N removal, and post-harvest soil N were not affected by swine manure application suggesting less benefit from swine manure in a high yield environment with adequate moisture. Manure and UAN increased soil N levels compared to the UTC at sampling times (wk 0), but generally did not affect N release. Differences in N levels among treatments stayed constant throughout incubation indicating that mineralization rates were similar across treatments. Additional N from swine manure application was present throughout the growing season, including post-harvest if conditions were dry or the yield environment was low. This presented a potential for N loss through nitrate leaching during the winter if N was not accumulated in the soybean crop, removed by grain, or lost during the season. Overall, manure application to double-crop soybean can be a sound manure management option if it can be executed with minimal soil disturbance, and it is especially beneficial for those producers that need to free up manure storage space...|$|R

A concept involving the blending of continuously produced reverse osmosis (RO) permeate with variable flow rate raw water bypass to meet fluctuations in demand has been proposed to address these water supply issues. This project developed a laboratory-scale version of the blending process with the objective to test a blending strategy and apply knowledge gained in hardware and software development. Two streams of different salinity water were used to simulate the RO permeate and raw water bypass. The raw water bypass flow rate was controlled by a solenoid. The water demand was sensed by an equalisation tank employing a continuous level sensor. LabVIEW was the software used to control the system via the blending algorithm that was developed. The blending strategy which was applied demonstrated that it is capable of maintaining steady states, with the exception of extreme cases of simulated demand. It is capable of maintaining simulated continuous operation of the reverse osmosis unit, whilst also maintaining the level of water in the tank above 50 %, thereby demonstrating that the proposed field-scale system can achieve its aims. Application in the laboratory-scale system of hardware components, such as the level sensor, and software components, such as the blending strategy, should be translated to <b>field-scale</b> for <b>trials.</b> This project identified blending strategies which may be tested in future work that could allow for improved product water quality, and fit-for-purpose water supply, thereby increasing the appropriateness of this technology...|$|R
40|$|In {{congested}} {{areas around}} the world, traffic has significantly grown beyond expectation {{in terms of both}} volume and weight. Any hinder to the traffic causes severe delays resulting not only in economic loss but also in extra pollution of the environment. Therefore, the number of times maintenance work have to be performed should be reduced as much as possible. Application of self-cementing, secondary materials such as Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) for base courses is one of the methods to reduce the need for maintenance, since such base courses can provide an increase of the stiffness and the strength of the pavement structure. The long-term performance of this type of self-cementing, secondary material is however not fully understood. Because this type of stabilization appears to be associated with undesired deformations and distresses such as heaves formation and cracking. These undesired defects, which appear at random in terms of severity and moment of occurring, requires an assessment of the long-term physical and mechanical performance of these materials. However, long-term behaviour is often difficult to predict. In general, <b>field-scale</b> <b>trials</b> monitored {{over a long period of}} time, are needed to provide information whether these materials can be used without significant risk or not. As an alternative to field trials, which are time consuming and expensive, reliable methodologies are needed to estimate the long-term physical and mechanical performance within a short period of time. In this research, a protocol is proposed as a means of exploring the long-term mechanical and physical performance of secondary materials. A slag mixture which is routinely used in the Netherlands in road (sub-) bases was selected as study material. The slag mixture consisted of fresh Air-cooled Blast Furnace Slag (AC-BFS), steel slag and Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) sand. The A 32 motorway in the Netherlands was used as a source of field aged Blast Furnace Slag and steel slag materials. The pavement structure of this motorway experienced serious failure after about 20 years of service life and the base layer material caused this failure. In order to prevent similar problems to occur in the future, this research suggests different methods to detect at an early stage potential poor material performance. The first step of exploring the long-term performance of self-cementing materials in road applications implies obtaining a better understanding of the physical, mechanical and microstructural features of the materials when used as road base material and to analysis its possible effects on the pavement performance. Consequently, the influence of different potential degradation conditions, which can be mimicked in the laboratory was investigated. Numerous failure mechanisms have been hypothesized, including chemical reactions and increased stresses due to obstructed deformations. Additionally, other physical failure mechanisms including frost action damage were investigated. The results show that there is a linkage between the secondary material performance and temperature, moisture, chemical composition and time. The measured data indicate a relationship between some major chemical compositions and the mechanical properties of slags. The response of the laboratory prepared samples to the proposed tests were similar to the A 32 base material failure, suggesting that the evaluation method did a reasonable job of producing in an accelerated way in the laboratory a material which behaves similar as the A 32 material. The developed procedure (protocol) suggests that it is possible on the basis of material characterization, steam aging tests and freezing – thawing tests to trace in a rather short period of time materials which may attribute to the failure process of base layers in pavements.

Soil samples and grain yields were collected using intensive soil sampling techniques and yield monitors from <b>field-scale,</b> replicated strip <b>trials.</b> The data were managed and analyzed using various {{geographical information systems}} (GIS) and statistical procedures. Use of yield monitors allowed for yield measurements for {{different areas of the}} field, which is a major advantage compared with the traditional method of weighing grain harvested from strips as long as the field length. This capability lead to various statistically valid estimates of treatment effects on crop yield and different interpretations of the results. These estimates arise from dividing the field into different areas in ways that still conform to sound field experimental design. Consideration of the spatial correlation of yield in analyses of variance by means of nearest neighbor analysis or modeled semivariograms improved the assessment of treatment effects compared with classic analyses. However, accounting for spatial correlation usually resulted in similar treatment means. Subjective scientific and agronomic judgment continues {{to play a major role}} in selecting the most appropriate analysis to achieve the objectives of the experiments and in interpreting the results...|$|R

We describe two experiments; the first experiment was conducted in a greenhouse where four forage species - orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), tall fescue [Lollium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S. J. Darbysh = Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort. ], perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. ssp. perenne), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. ssp. sativa and falcata (L.) Arcang) were used to determine between and within variation. Perennial ryegrass contained the largest amount of [alpha]-linolenic and total FA while alfalfa possessed the greatest amount of linoleic acid. Populations within each species showed significant variation for nearly all FAs examined. Additionally, [alpha]-linolenic and total FA had the greatest correlation to the phenotypic trait, total chlorophyll. The second experiment was a <b>field-scale</b> grazing <b>trial</b> with steers finished on three pasture treatments: tall fescue, tall fescue with red clover (Trifolium pretense L.), and tall fescue with alfalfa. The pasture treatments were different for crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestible neutral detergent fiber (dNDF, on a proportion basis), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and FAs myristic (C 14 : 0), palmitic (C 16 : 0), palmitoleic (C 16 : 1), steric (C 18 : 0), oleic, (C 18 : 1) linoleic (C 18 : 2), and total FAs. Steers (Bos taurus L.) grazing pastures with either red clover or alfalfa had greater average daily gains than cattle grazing tall fescue alone. However, differences found in pasture FAs did not translate into differences for any FA examined in beef. Therefore, it seems that factors other than forage FA concentration, like cattle genetics, are more important than the type of forage being fed to produce beef with high levels of omega- 3 FA...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic ponds are an {{established}} technology for treating farm dairy effluent in New Zealand. These ponds produce {{a significant amount}} of methane but because of their large size, they are rarely covered for methane capture. The removal of solids prior to entering the ponds would allow for shorter retention times resulting in smaller ponds that could be covered. However, removal of solids entails loss of organic material and thus methane production. It was proposed that improved hydrolysis of solid content prior to solids separation could increase the organic content of the liquid fraction. No literature was found describing two-stage (acidogenic/hydrolytic and methanogenic) systems which achieve hydrolysis combined with solids separation of manure slurries. Hence, the aim of the present study is to examine the feasibility of such a system. Five parameters were examined to determine favourable conditions for hydrolysis of solids and acidogenesis in farm dairy effluent. These were: 1) mixing, 2) hydraulic retention time (HRT), 3) liquid to solid ratio (dilution), 4) addition of rumen contents, and 5) reactor configuration. Continuous mixing of cow manure sludge inhibited net volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, likely due to oxygenation. By comparison, a once-daily brief stirring regime resulted in production of 785 mgVFA/Lsludge compared with 185 mg/L from a continuously stirred reactor. Mixing had little effect on soluble COD yield. HRTs ranging between 1 and 10 days resulted in greater hydrolysis yields (0. 25 to 0. 33 gCOD/gVSadded) compared with 0. 15 gCOD/gVSadded for a 15 -day HRT. It was hypothesised that the attachment of hydrolytic bacteria to solids prevented washout at shorter HRTs. In contrast, longer HRTs favoured VFA production. This may have been due to the planktonic nature of acidogenic bacteria, making them more vulnerable to washout at shorter HRTs. The effects of solid:liquid ratio on hydrolysis and acidogenesis were examined with sludge:water ratios ranging from 1 : 1 to 1 : 0. 25. The addition of larger volumes of water resulted in improved acidogenesis with the 1 : 1 sludge:water mixture producing a liquor with 245 % more VFA mass (635 mg) than reactors with a 1 : 0. 25 sludge:water mixture (184 mg). Addition of rumen contents was shown to have little or no effect on either acidogenesis or hydrolysis. This may have been due to a masking effect of an increased organic load through the addition of undigested grass in the rumen. A mix, settle and decant (MSD) system and an unmixed flow-through leachbed separator system were trialled and compared as hydrolytic/acidogenic reactors. The MSD system produced 0. 033 gVFA/gTSadded and 0. 315 gCOD/gTSadded compared with 0. 015 gVFA/gTSadded and 0. 155 gCOD/gTSadded in the unmixed leachbed separator. It was hypothesised that improved mixing and longer solid-liquid contact times in the MSD system provided greater surface contact and transfer of organics to the liquid phase thereby enhancing hydrolysis. A two-stage (acidogenic/hydrolytic and methanogenic) system was tested at bench scale. A partially mixed leachbed separator was fed with manure slurry. This retained solids while leaching out a treated feed high in organic content to be fed into a variety of methanogenic systems. The leachbed separator produced a treated feed with a VFA concentration of 562 mg/L, 120 % higher than the influent slurry (255 mg/L). Soluble COD increased 60 % from 1, 085 mg/L in the slurry to 1, 740 mg/L in the treated feed. 20 -day HRT and 10 -day HRT unmixed unheated methanogenic reactors, both fed with treated feed from the leachbed separator, had lower specific methane yields (0. 14 and 0. 11 LCH 4 /gVS respectively) than a 50 -day HRT reactor fed with untreated slurry (0. 17 LCH 4 /gVS). However, both the 20 -day HRT reactor and the 10 -day reactor had higher volumetric methane yields (0. 033 and 0. 057 LCH 4 /Lreactor/day respectively) than the 50 -day HRT reactor fed with slurry (0. 024 LCH 4 /Lreactor/day). Gas production was shown to rise as the VFA levels in the treated feed rose. Fermentation in the leachbed followed by separation was shown to improve average gas production by up to 57 % compared to separation alone. <b>Field-scale</b> <b>trials</b> of a leachbed separator system followed by a 20 -day HRT methanogenic reactor were undertaken. VFA concentrations increased from 100 mg/l in the influent to 1, 260 mg/l in the treated feed, while the soluble COD increased from 2, 766 mg/L to 5, 542 mg/L. The methanogenic reactor produced 0. 08 m 3 CH 4 / m 3 reactor/day, four times higher than that which would be expected from a covered pond of the same size. This was hypothesised to be due to the increased biodigestability of the feed to the tank digester as well the increased organic loading rate. This study indicates that the use of a leachbed separator would be an effective low-tech strategy for reducing the HRT of farm anaerobic ponds, and reducing the size of covers required for biogas energy recovery...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the dynamic}} nature of soil {{nitrogen}} (N), inorganic N fertilization to corn (Zea mays L.) has potential to alter N pool balance {{by creating an}} accumulation or depletion of soil N. Current corn N recommendations in the common corn-soybean rotation of Indiana strive {{to find the best}} N rate that maximizes producer profit. Increasing our understanding of soil N will inform producers if they should adjust fertilizer rates for corn to influence maintenance of organic N and Carbon. Our objective was to determine residual N effects from fertilized corn in a corn-soybean rotation by measuring (1) soil N pools post soybean, (2) soil fertility, (3) growth and yield of corn, and (4) nitrogen removal in rotated corn. ^ <b>Field-scale</b> corn N <b>trials</b> were established in 2006 at 6 Indiana farms with corn-soybean rotations (near cities of West Lafayette, Farmland, Columbia City, Wanatah, Butlerville, and Lafayette). A randomized complete block design assigned six corn N rates (ranging from starter only to above the minimum needed to maximize yield) to each replication. The design was not re-randomized the next corn year. In 2015, two or three of the replications at each location had only starter fertilizer, thus, allowing for determination of cumulative differences in N fertilization on soil N supply. Soil composites of each plot were collected from 0 - 20 cm, 20 - 40 cm, and 40 - 60 cm post corn planting (3 ̆c 9 days). Initial samples were analyzed for general fertility, inorganic N, and total N. In addition, a 50 -day incubation with soils maintained at 25 °C and 33 kPa moisture was used to examine mineralization and nitrification at days 10 and 50 days. Earleaf samples were collected at VT followed by stover and grain samples at maturity; plant samples were analyzed for macro- and micro-nutrient concentrations. Grain yield and total plant N uptake were also determined. ^ Locations were kept separate for statistical analyses. ANOVAs carried out on general soil fertility data revealed minimal N rate effects. At Lafayette, pH for the 0 - 20 cm soil decreased linearly beginning at N rate 3 (135 kg ha - 1); the acidifying effect of the side-dressed urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) may be responsible for the pH decrease with increasing N rate. This trend was not observed at other locations. There was no N rate effect on day 0 total inorganic N (α ≤ 0. 05). As N rate increased, total N decreased linearly from 0. 9 to 0. 8 g kg- 1 (R 2 = 0. 68) at Columbia City. When the soil was incubated for 50 days, total inorganic N did not vary by N rate. Generally, soil inorganic and organic N decreased with depth from 0 to 60 cm. When corn was grown and the predominate source of N was derived from the soil, no differences were noted in plant N uptake nor yield for any location. ^ Spring 2015 had record-breaking rainfall amounts which certainly contributed to residual N loss. Furthermore, the soil’s natural N supply, location management practice, and crop N demand are probable cause for the variances noted between locations. Overall, we conclude that corn N rate has negligible effects on residual N abundance, soil fertility, uptake, and grain yield for Indiana corn-soybean rotations. ...|$|R
