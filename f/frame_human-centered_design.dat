40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Human Integration Design Processes (HIDP) {{document}} is to provide human-systems integration design processes, including methodologies and best practices that NASA has used to meet human systems and human rating requirements for developing crewed spacecraft. HIDP content is <b>framed</b> around <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> methodologies and processes in support of human-system integration requirements and human rating. NASA-STD- 3001, Space Flight Human-System Standard, is a two-volume set of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Agency-level standards established by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer, directed at minimizing health and performance risks for flight crews in human space flight programs. Volume 1 of NASA-STD- 3001, Crew Health, sets standards for fitness for duty, space flight permissible exposure limits, permissible outcome limits, levels of medical care, medical diagnosis, intervention, treatment and care, and countermeasures. Volume 2 of NASASTD- 3001, Human Factors, Habitability, and Environmental Health, focuses on human physical and cognitive capabilities and limitations and defines standards for spacecraft (including orbiters, habitats, and suits), internal environments, facilities, payloads, and related equipment, hardware, and software with which the crew interfaces during space operations. The NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 8705. 2 B, Human-Rating Requirements for Space Systems, specifies the Agency's human-rating processes, procedures, and requirements. The HIDP was written to share NASA's knowledge of processes directed toward achieving human certification of a spacecraft through implementation of human-systems integration requirements. Although the HIDP speaks directly to implementation of NASA-STD- 3001 and NPR 8705. 2 B requirements, the <b>human-centered</b> <b>design,</b> evaluation, and design processes described in this document {{can be applied to}} any set of human-systems requirements and are independent of reference missions. The HIDP is a reference document that is intended to be used during the development of crewed space systems and operations to guide human-systems development process activities...|$|R

50|$|<b>Human-centered</b> <b>design</b> {{has been}} both lauded and critiqued {{for its ability to}} {{actively}} problem solve with affected communities. Critiques include the inability of <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> to push the boundaries of available technology by solely tailoring to the demands of present-day solutions, rather than focus on possible future solutions. In addition, <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> often considers context, but does not offer tailored approaches for very specific groups of people. New research on innovative approaches include youth-centered health design, which focuses on youth as the central aspect with particular needs and limitations not always addressed by <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> approaches.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the qualitatively different ways which students experienced <b>human-centered</b> <b>design.</b> The findings of this research are important in developing effective design learning experiences and have potential impact across design education. This study provides the basis {{for being able to}} assess learning of <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> which will allow educational programs to determine their impact, and what aspects are most effective. ^ Because the object of study was the variation of students’ experiences <b>human-centered</b> <b>design,</b> a phenomenographic framework was used to guide the methodology of the study. The literature and research on service-learning and <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> informed the construction of the phenomenographic study and also provided ways to interpret the data and situate the results. ^ Thirty-three student designers from a variety of academic contexts were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended approach in which they discussed concrete experiences “designing for others”, and reflections and meanings associated with those experiences. Analysis of the data yielded seven qualitatively different ways in which the students experienced <b>human-centered</b> <b>design,</b> or categories of description. Logically related, the seven categories of description formed an outcome space that was two-dimensional with distinct, but not independent, axes. The critical differences among the categories provided the basis for developing their hierarchical relationship. Five of the categories were nested hierarchically. From less comprehensive to more comprehensive, those categories included: <b>Human-centered</b> <b>design</b> as “User as Information Source Input to Linear Process”, “Keep Users’ Needs in Mind”, “Design in Context”, “Commitment” and “Empathic Design”. Two categories represented ways of experiencing <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> that were distinct: <b>design</b> was not <b>human-centered,</b> but “Technology-Centered” and <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> was not design, but “Service”. ^ In addition, this study found that students’ understanding of the user and their ability to integrate that into their design are related in the development of more comprehensive ways of experiencing <b>human-centered</b> <b>design,</b> and a conception of both aspects is needed. Furthermore, critical or immersive experiences involving real clients and users were important in allowing the students to experience <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> in more comprehensive ways. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on airline pilot surveys, {{industry}} {{committees and}} workshops, conducted on advanced technology "glass cockpit " airplanes, concerns {{have been raised}} about the application and long-term effects of automation technologies. It has been pointed out that purely technology-driven designs had resulted in unintended and unforeseen negative consequences. In order to counter this trend it has been proposed to shift the focus from technology-centered designs to what {{has become known as}} <b>human-centered</b> <b>design.</b> There are three primary objectives within a <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> philosophy: (1) the design should enhance the user's abilities, (2) the design should help overcome user limitations, and (3) the design should foster user acceptance.

Further, <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> typically focuses on integrating technology or other useful tools in order to alleviate problems, especially around issues of health.

5000|$|<b>Human-centered</b> <b>design</b> may be {{utilized}} in multiple fields, including sociological sciences and technology. It {{has been noted}} {{for its ability to}} consider human dignity, access, and ability roles when developing solutions. Because of this, <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> may more fully incorporate culturally sound, human-informed, and appropriate solutions to problems in a variety of fields rather than solely product and technology-based fields. Typically, <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> is more focused on [...] "methodologies and techniques for interacting with people in such a manner as to facilitate the detection of meanings, desires and needs, either by verbal or non-verbal means." [...] In contrast, user-centered design is another approach and framework of processes which considers the human role in product use, but focuses largely on the production of interactive technology designed around the user's physical attributes rather than social problem solving.|$|R
40|$|The current {{emphasis}} on social responsibility and community collaboration within higher education {{has led to}} an increased drive to include service learning in the curriculum. With its {{emphasis on}} mutually beneficial collaborations, service learning can be meaningful for both students and the community, but is challenging to manage successfully. From a design education perspective, {{it is interesting to note}} that contemporary design practice emphasises a similar approach known as a <b>human-centered</b> <b>design,</b> where users are considered and included throughout the design process. In considering both service learning and <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> as foundations for design pedagogy, various philosophical and methodological similarities are evident. The paper explores the relationship between a service learning community engagement approach and a <b>human-centered</b> <b>design</b> approach in contemporary communication design education. To this end, each approach is considered individually after which a joint frame of reference is presented. Butin’s service learning typology, namely the four Rs – respect, reciprocity, relevance and reflection – serves as a point of departure for the joint frame of reference.
