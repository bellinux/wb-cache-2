Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient <b>inland</b> <b>transportation.</b> It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E

40|$|The <b>inland</b> {{waterway}} <b>transportation</b> {{system of}} the United States (U. S.) handles 11. 7 billion tons of freight annually and connects the heartland of the U. S. {{with the rest of}} the world by providing a fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. This dissertation aims to create decision support tools for maritime stakeholders to measure the economic impacts of the <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transportation</b> systems under real world scenarios including disruptions, demand changes, port expansion decisions, and channel deepening investments. Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and multiregional input-output modeling techniques are utilized to analyze the complex relationships between <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transportation</b> system components and regional economic impact factors. The first research contribution illustrates that the expected duration of a disruption determines whether decision makers are better off waiting for the waterway system to reopen or switching to an alternative mode of transportation. Moreover, total disruption cost can be reduced by increasing estimation accuracy of disruption duration. The second research contribution shows that without future investment in inland waterway infrastructure, a sustainable system and associate economic impacts cannot be generated in the long-term. The third research contribution illustrates that investing in bottleneck system components results in higher economic impact than investing in non-bottleneck components. The developed models can be adapted to any <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transportation</b> system in the U. S. by utilizing data obtained by publically available sources to measure the economic impacts under various scenarios to inform capital investment decisions and support an economically sustainable <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transportation</b> system...|$|R

6000|$|While {{this simple}} {{pastoral}} life was centred around the school-house in the clearing, {{broken only by}} an occasional warning pistol-shot {{in the direction of}} the Harrison-McKinstry boundaries, the more business part of Indian Spring was overtaken by one of those spasms of enterprise peculiar to all Californian mining settlements. The opening of the Eureka Ditch and the extension of stagecoach communication from Big Bluff were events of no small importance, and were celebrated on the same day. The double occasion overtaxing even the fluent rhetoric of the editor of the [...] "Star" [...] left him struggling in the metaphorical difficulties of a Pactolian Spring, which he had rashly turned into the Ditch, and obliged him to transfer the onerous duty of writing the editorial on the Big Bluff Extension to the hands of the Honorable Abner Dean, Assemblyman from Angel's. The loss of the Honorable Mr. Dean's right eye in an early pioneer fracas did not prevent him from looking into the dim vista of the future and discovering with that single unaided optic enough to fill three columns of the [...] "Star." [...] "It is not too extravagant to say," [...] he remarked with charming deprecation, [...] "that Indian Spring, through its own perfectly organized system of <b>inland</b> <b>transportation,</b> the confluence of its North Fork with the Sacramento River, and their combined effluence into the illimitable Pacific, is thus put not only into direct communication with far Cathay but even remoter Antipodean markets. The citizen of Indian Spring taking the 9 A. M. Pioneer Coach and arriving at Big Bluff at 2.40 is enabled to connect with the through express to Sacramento the same evening, reaching San Francisco per the Steam Navigation Company's palatial steamers in time to take the Pacific Mail Steamer to Yokohama on the following day at 8.30 P. M." [...] Although no citizen of Indian Spring appeared to avail himself of this admirable opportunity, nor did it appear at all likely that any would, everybody vaguely felt that an inestimable boon lay in the suggestion, and even the master professionally intrusting the reading aloud of the editorial to Rupert Filgee with ulterior designs of practice in the pronunciation of five-syllable words, was somewhat affected by it. Johnny Filgee and Jimmy Snyder accepting it as a mysterious something that made Desert Islands accessible at a moment's notice and a trifling outlay, were round-eyed and attentive. And the culminating information from the master that this event would be commemorated by a half-holiday, combined to make the occasion as exciting to the simple school-house in the clearing as it was to the gilded saloon in the main street.|$|E

Rising rail costs at West Coast ports, coupled with port congestion and lengthy transit times, are causing shippers to seek cost-effective alternatives. As a result, the market share of Asian cargo has dramatically increased on the East and Gulf Coasts and ports are expanding terminal capacity and improving the <b>inland</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructure in response. The Port of New Orleans can provide less expensive <b>inland</b> <b>transportation</b> and faster transit times to the industrial Midwest and the East Coast than Houston, which continues to experience inland congestion because of its large local market {{to the north and}} west, including Dallas and Kansas City.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} tra�c in vehicular river corridors {{as well as}} {{the growing}} demands on e�ciency and positional accuracy for <b>inland</b> water <b>transportation</b> of goods have made the determination of position, navigation and timing (PNT) data including additional integrity information {{and the development of a}} driver assistance system for inland water vessels based on this PNT data one of the most important challenges facing modern <b>inland</b> water <b>transportation</b> and a major practical problem for both navigators and geodesists. As the basis of a driver assistance system, this work describes the architecture of a system including the tightly-coupled sensor fusion of GNSS and IMU data for the determination of reliable PNT data in real-time with inland water tra�c purposes. Moreover, a simple mathematical model of vessel manoeuvring is presented. Optimisation approaches based on Interior Point Optimisation and Sequential Quadratic Programming are applied to search for the vessel trajectory considering several tra�c conditions. Finally, �first numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{resources}} of the world’s oceans need to be fully utilized to benefit human activities in a sustainable manner. The maritime industry has made use of the ocean in a very responsible way, but inland water resources {{have been much more}} underutilized and under- maintained, especially for transportation. In an age so dire to find ways to mitigate the challenge of climate change and its associated impacts, recent research has indicated that <b>inland</b> water <b>transportation</b> represents the cleanest mode of transportation. This indicates the potential for an increase in usage of <b>inland</b> waterways for <b>transportation.</b> The use of <b>inland</b> water <b>transportation</b> is forecast to rise because of the potential for short sea shipping, expanding deep-sea operations, and alternative mitigation options for climate change. Coastal water transportation is associated with low probability, high consequence accidents, which makes reliability requirements for the design and operation for safety and environmental protection very necessary. Collision represents the largest percentage of accident risk scenarios among water transportation risk factors. This paper discusses recent work in risk and reliabilitybased design, and safe and efficient vessel operation in coastal waters. This includes systems based approach that covers proactive risk as well as holistic, multiple-criteria assessment of waterways variables required to develop mitigation options and decision support for preventive, protective and control measures for various collision accident scenarios within inland waterways...|$|R
