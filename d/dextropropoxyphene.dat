5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} allergic to paracetamol (acetaminophen) or <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> and in alcoholics. <b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> {{is not intended}} for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> is {{available}} on prescription, both as a combined product (32.5mg <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> per 325mg paracetamol branded as Di-gesic, Capadex, or Paradex; it is also available in pure form (100mg capsules) known as Doloxene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> {{has been}} found to be helpful in {{relieving}} the symptoms of restless legs syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, both pure <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> {{capsules}} (as napsylate, 100mg), {{marketed as}} Doloxene, and combination tablets and capsules (with paracetamol) all containing 32.5mg <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> HCl with 325mg paracetamol, which are currently available on prescription {{were supposed to}} be withdrawn from 1 March 2012, but Aspen Pharma sought a review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which ruled in 2013 that the drugs could be sold under strict conditions.|$|E
25|$|Overdose is {{commonly}} broken into two categories: liver toxicity (from paracetamol poisoning) and <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> overdose.|$|E
25|$|Several {{synthetic}} opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as pethidine, levorphanol, methadone, <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> tramadol and ketobemidone.|$|E
25|$|Effective May 2008, Sweden {{classified}} tramadol as {{a controlled}} substance {{in the same}} category as codeine and <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> but allows a normal prescription be used currently.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, Medsafe {{announced}} Paradex and Capadex (forms of <b>dextropropoxyphene)</b> {{were being}} {{withdrawn from the}} marketplace due to health issues, and withdrawal in other countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> {{acts as an}} mu-opioid {{receptor}} agonist. It also acts as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, {{as well as a}} weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Darvon, a <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> {{formulation}} made by Eli Lilly, {{which had}} been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by consumer groups that said it was associated with suicide. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently. But Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign among doctors, pharmacists and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010 the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of <b>dextropropoxyphene.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> {{is subject}} to some controversy: while many {{physicians}} prescribe it {{for a wide range}} of mildly to moderately painful symptoms, as well as for treatment of diarrhea, many others refuse to prescribe it, citing limited effectiveness. In addition, the therapeutic index of dextroproxyphene is relatively narrow.|$|E
25|$|Caution {{should be}} used when {{administering}} <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> particularly with children and the elderly and with patients who may be pregnant or breast feeding; other reported problems include kidney, liver or respiratory disorders, and prolonged use. Attention should be paid to concomitant use with tranquillizers, antidepressants or excess alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Before the FDA-directed recall, <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> HCl was {{available}} in the United States as a prescription formulation with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in ratio from 30mg / 600mg to 100mg / 650mg (or 100mg / 325mg {{in the case of}} Balacet), respectively. These are usually named Darvocet. Darvon is a pure propoxyphene preparation that does not contain paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1978, {{while on}} holiday {{with her parents}} and baby Georgia in Cornwall, Denny was injured when she fell down a {{staircase}} and hit her head on concrete. Following the incident, she suffered from intense headaches; a doctor prescribed her the painkiller <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> a drug known to have fatal side effects when mixed with alcohol.|$|E
25|$|An {{overdose}} of <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> {{may lead to}} various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation {{is responsible for the}} CNS depression, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, miosis, and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for mood- or thought-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{preparations}} containing only <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> were discontinued in 2004. In 2007, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency {{removed the}} licence for co-proxamol, also called distalgesic. From then {{on in the}} UK, co-proxamol is only available on a named patient basis, for long-term chronic pain and {{only to those who}} have already been prescribed this medicine. Its withdrawal from the UK market is a result of concerns relating to its toxicity in overdose (even small overdoses can be fatal), and dangerous reaction with alcohol. Recreational use in the UK is uncommon. Many patients have been prescribed alternative combinations of drugs as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|It was {{discussed}} {{at the time that}} people who abuse alcohol and other substances and take combination dextropoxyphene / acetaminophen (paracetamol) may need to take many combination tablets to reach euphoria, because the amount of <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> per tablet is relatively low (30–40mg). The ingested paracetamol—the other component—may then reach liver toxic levels. In the case of alcoholics, who often already have damaged livers, even a relatively small overdose with paracetamol may produce hepatotoxicity, liver failure and necrosis. This toxicity with the combination of overdosed dextroproxyphene (with its CNS/respiratory depression/vomit with risk for aspiration pneumonia, as well as cardiotoxicity) and paracetamol-induced liver damage can result in death.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden, {{physicians}} {{had long}} been discouraged by the medical products agency to prescribe <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> due {{to the risk of}} respiratory depression and even death when taken with alcohol. Physicians have earlier been recommended to prescribe products with only <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> and not to patients with a history of drug abuse, depression or suicidal tendencies. Products with mixed active ingredients were taken off the market and only products with <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> were allowed to be sold. [...] Dextropoxyphene was de facto narcotica labelled.|$|E

2500|$|In pure form, <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> is {{commonly}} used to ease the withdrawal symptoms in people addicted to opioids. Being very weak in comparison to commonly abused opioids, <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> can only act as a [...] "partial" [...] substitute. It does not have much effect on mental cravings; however, it can be effective in alleviating physical withdrawal effects, such as muscle cramps.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, the European Commission {{requested}} the European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{to review the}} safety and effectiveness of <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> based medicines and on 25 June 2009 the EMA recommended a gradual withdrawal throughout the European Union. The EMA's conclusion was based on evidence that dextropropoxyphene-containing medicines were weak painkillers, the combination of <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> and paracetamol was no more effective than paracetamol on its own, {{and the difference between}} the dose needed for treatment and a harmful dose (the [...] "therapeutic index") was too small.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> is {{sometimes}} combined with acetaminophen. Trade names include Darvocet-N and Di-Gesic, Darvon with APAP (for <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> and paracetamol). The British approved name (i.e. the generic {{name of the}} active ingredient) of the paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene preparation is [...] "co-proxamol" [...] (sold {{under a variety of}} brand names); however, it has been withdrawn since 2007, and is no longer available to new patients, with exceptions. The paracetamol combination(s) are known as Capadex or Di-Gesic in Australia, Lentogesic in South Africa, and Di-Antalvic in France (unlike co-proxamol, which is an approved name, these are all brand names).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene,</b> like codeine, is a weak opioid, {{known to}} cause {{dependency}} among recreational users. Codeine is more commonly used; however, as codeine is, in essence, a prodrug that requires in vivo metabolism for efficacy, it is ineffective for some individuals with the [...] "poor metabolizer" [...] genotype of the liver cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. In people with this low-function isoform, <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> is particularly useful, as its metabolism does not require CYP2D6. It is also used for patients with digestive complaints, as it is less liable to worsen their symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, an FDA {{advisory}} committee voted 14 to 12 against the continued marketing of propoxyphene products, {{based on its}} weak pain-killing abilities, addictiveness, association with drug deaths and possible heart problems, including arrhythmia. A subsequent re-evaluation resulted in a July 2009 recommendation to strengthen the boxed warning for propoxyphene to reflect the risk of overdose. <b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> subsequently carried a black box warning in the U.S., stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dextropropoxyphene</b> is an {{analgesic}} in the opioid category, patented in 1955 {{and manufactured}} by Eli Lilly and Company. [...] It is an optical isomer of levopropoxyphene. It {{is intended to}} treat mild pain and also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias. Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) {{is said to be}} 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2 hours after oral administration.|$|E

50|$|Norpropoxyphene {{is a major}} {{metabolite}} of the {{opioid analgesic}} drug <b>dextropropoxyphene,</b> and is responsible {{for many of the}} side effects associated with use of this drug, especially the unusual toxicity seen during <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> overdose. It has weaker analgesic effects than <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> itself, but is a relatively potent pro-convulsant and blocker of sodium and potassium channels, particularly in heart tissue, which produces prolonged intracardiac conduction time and can lead to heart failure following even relatively minor overdoses. The toxicity of this metabolite makes <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> up to 10 times more likely to cause death following overdose compared to other similar mild opioid analgesics, and has led to <b>dextropropoxyphene</b> being withdrawn from the market in some countries.|$|E
