40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} modeling sustained educational change via the use of dynamic multipliers applied to panel data. Dynamic multipliers arise from the incorporation of lagged endogenous variables in linear models. Three types of dynamic multipliers can be defined: (a) the impact multiplier, (b) interim multipli-ers, and (c) the long-run equilibrium multiplier. An impact multiplier gives {{the effect of a}} unit increase in an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable in the par-ticular sample period. An interim multiplier gives the effect of a unit increase in an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable when that effect is sustained for a specified amount of time. A long-run equilibrium multiplier gives the effect of a unit increase in an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable when sustained into the indefinite future. This article seeks to develop and advocate <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> analysis for education research. Extensions to multivariate dynamic linear models and multilevel linear models are provided. Three examples are presented to illus-trate the methodology. The article closes with a discussion of the implications of <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> analysis for education policy analysis...|$|E

We model the domain as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiply</b> sectioned Bayesian network (DMSBN) and populate the domain {{by a set}} of proprietary, cooperative agents.

In comparison with independent DBN-based agents, multiagent DMSBNs produce more accurate forecasts.

40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} {{positive}} comovements between land prices and business investment are {{a driving force}} behind the broad impact of land-price dynamics on the macroeconomy. We develop an economic mechanism that captures the comovements by incorporating two key features into a DSGE model: we introduce land as a collateral asset in firms ’ credit constraints, and we identify a shock that drives most of the observed fluctuations in land prices. Our estimates imply that these two features combine to generate an empirically important mechanism that amplifies and propagates macroeconomic fluctuations through the joint dynamics of land prices and business investment.

30|$|Impulse {{response}} functions {{based on}} a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) analysis provide evidence for {{the negative effects of}} economic recession on the unemployment dynamics, i.e., the inflow rate to unemployment rises and the outflow rate from unemployment drops. In addition, the results of the SVAR analysis indicate that the negative effects of economic recession on the outflow from unemployment are slightly more protracted compared to those on the inflow rate. Cumulative <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> functions from a VAR model suggest that structural reforms at times of deepening recession can aggravate the unemployment problem by raising the inflow and lowering the outflow rate, while structural reforms undertaken at times of gradual recovery or decelerating recession can be associated with an increase in the outflow and a decline in the inflow rate.|$|E

The model suggested substantially modifies that of Keen(1995), who combined insights from Goodwin and Minsky within a model of fluctuating growth.

This paper sets forth a theory of the Islamic revival in Egypt—the epicenter of the movement in the Arab world. We begin by documenting a contemporaneous de-cline in social mobility among educated youth, caused by a contraction in public sector employment. We then show how an unexpected decline in social mobility combined with inequality can produce a religious revival, led by the educated middle class, not the poor and illiterate. The principal idea is that religion is a coping mechanism for unfulfilled aspiration, which occurs when consumption falls below an expectations-based reference point. Religious participation by ed-ucated youth builds organizational capacity and can produce <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> effects which lead to a popular and long-lasting religious movement.

40|$|To explain {{economic}} {{impacts of}} flood damage due {{to climate change}} over time in Japan, this study develops a dynamic spatial computable general equilibrium model, and measures flood damage costs through some numerical experiments. It is inferred that the frequency {{and the intensity of}} flood are on the long-term increase. In the category of flood damage in Japan, there are serious flood damages to social capitals. These observations are described in statistical research on flood by Japanese government. In this study, these damages are defined as 8 ̆ 1 gthe direct damage 8 ̆ 1 h, and are different from decrease in equivalent consumption due to the direct effect. Also, the proportion of the direct damage to decrease in equivalent consumption is defined as 8 ̆ 1 gthe <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> of damage cost 8 ̆ 1 h. This study develops a spatial CGE model based on dynamic structure of the Ramsey model. Our model has 8 regions and 20 production sectors. The flood scenario is described as increase in capital depreciation rate due to flood from 2000 to 2050. In our simulations, 5 flood damage rates are used consisting of damage rates calculating by 4 climate models and uniform damage rate throughout Japan. To consider dynamic spillover effects of flood damage, this study proposes two indices as dynamic damage costs that are comparative static and transition dynamics. The former is the long-term damage caused as the result of shifts from a steady-state equilibrium to another by increasing in the frequency and the intensity of flood due to climate change. On the other hand, the latter is the difference between flood damage costs by a baseline scenario and by a flood scenario, on the transition path to a new steady-state equilibrium. As the transition path can be described, this study shows possible dynamic spillover effects of flood damage over time. The findings in this study are shown below. 1) In 2050, the total amount of flood damage cost is estimated to be from about US 0. 4 billion to about US 5. 6 billion. 2) The decrease in the rate of investment return by the long-term increase in flood damage causes decrease in savings and consumption, so that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> of damage cost is estimated to be from 1. 2 to 1. 7 times...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple macrodynamic {{model of the}} real-financial markets inter action with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> {{representing}} the goods market and a structured portfolio choice between money holdings and equities. This is contrasted with Blanchard’s (1981) alternative approach, where interest-bearing bonds and equities are perfect substitutes and are subject to myopic perfect foresight, {{with the result that}} the usual saddle-point dynamics is established, and where therefore the jump-variable technique of the rational expectations approach is needed in order to tame the explosive nature of the model by assumption. We consider this latter representation a very virtual one in contrast to our descriptive treatment of the interaction of the real with the financial markets. Our implied dynamical system has three dimensions: output, share prices and capital gains expectations. We show that this model exhibits a financial accelerator mechanism that endangers the stability of its stationary solution, at least when it becomes sufficiently strong. Furthermore, we show that this type of instability can definitely be overcome if actual capital gains are taxed to a sufficient degree. This tax policy is therefore effective as compared to an interest rate policy of Taylor type, showing that monetary policy may not impact the markets for risky financial assets, unless it is interpreted as state of confidence for the current situation of the economy and may therefore be fairly overrated in the current macrodynamic literature. By contrast, all policy measures that stabilise the profit rate of the economy may add to the stability implications of the assumed Asada et al.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider {{a model of}} Blanchard and Fischer which reformulated Keynesian IS-LM {{analysis}} {{from the perspective of}} a richer array of financial assets, namely short-term and long-term bonds, and thus from the perspective of the term structure of interest rates. The basic change in this extension of the IS-LM approach is that investment demand (and also consumption demand) now depend on the long-term rate of interest in the place of the short-term rate. This implies that the IS-curve and the LM-curve are no longer situated in the same diagram, but have to be linked via the dynamics of long-term bond prices (in the approach of Blanchard and Fischer based on perfect substitutes, perfect foresight and the jump variable technique), thereby creating one of the links for the real-financial interaction to be investigated, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>multiplier</b> process and the conventional LM curve representing the other one. Based on this dynamic interaction of real and financial markets we will reflect the outcomes achieved by Blanchard and Fischer from the perspective of imperfect substitutes and imperfect forecasts of capital gains in the place of the limit case of perfect substitutes and myopic perfect foresight. We derive on this basis an alternative to the conventional jump variable technique and its treatment of unanticipated and anticipated monetary and fiscal policy, which is global in nature and does not depend on the local analysis of saddlepath stability as in the case of the jump variable technique. Endogenous fluctuations around the unique steady state of the model arise from patching two nonlinear dynamical systems, each of which [...] but not their interaction [...] is of a very simple nature. ...|$|E

40|$|Extreme {{events are}} one of the main {{channels}} through which climate and socio- economic systems interact and it is likely that climate change will modify their probability distributions. The long-term growth models used in climate change as- sessments, however, cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To inves- tigate this issue, a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. In the model, <b>dynamic</b> processes <b>multiply</b> the extreme event direct costs by a factor 20. Half of this increase comes from short-term processes, that long-term growth models cannot capture. The model exhibits also a bifurcation in GDP losses: for a given distribution of extremes, there is a value of the ability to fund reconstruction below which GDP losses increases dramatically. This bifurcation may partly explain why some poor countries that experience repeated natural disasters cannot develop. It also shows that changes in the distribution of extremes may entail significant GDP losses and that climate change may force a specific adaptation of the economic organization. These results show that averaging short-term processes like extreme events over the yearly time step of a long-term growth model can lead to inaccurately low assessments of the climate change damages.
