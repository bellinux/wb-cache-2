50|$|From about 1950 to {{his death}} in February 1981, Iosif Silimon was Romania's most {{prominent}} glider designer, his aircraft distinguished by his initials. The IS-4 first flew on 5 June 1959. It was a high wing cantilever monoplane with an all wood structure and was largely plywood skinned. The wings, mounted with 2.5Â° of dihedral, were double straight tapered, {{with a little more}} taper outboard and an almost unswept leading edge. They were built around a single spar with a forward torsion box between it and the leading edge. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. Ply and fabric covered ailerons ran from the tips over the more tapered outboard panels, with mid-chord spoilers immediately <b>inboard,</b> <b>opening</b> above and below the wing.|$|E
50|$|The FK-3 was {{designed}} by Otto Funk to be a high performance sailplane, particularly suited to weak thermal conditions but also easy to fly. It is a largely metal pod and boom aircraft, with cantilever shoulder wings. The wing has a thickness/chord ratio of 15.3% and a simple straight tapered plan with square tips, built around a single spar. It made use of plastic foams, both in the light alloy-foam sandwich ribs and with a rigid foam honeycomb structure between the ribs to support the 0.50 mm skin. The whole trailing edge is filled with control surfaces; inboard of the ailerons there are camber changing flaps divided into two parts, the inner section deflecting through greater angles than the outer. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted at <b>inboard</b> at mid-chord, <b>opening</b> {{above and below the}} wing. The wings also contain rubber bags to hold up to 110 lb of water ballast, with a dump valve in the fuselage behind the undercarriage monowheel.|$|R
