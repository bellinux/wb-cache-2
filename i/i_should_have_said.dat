500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I say here, it's sad to say them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is stuff <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hirsi Ali criticises {{the central}} Islamic prophet on {{morality}} and personality traits (criticisms based on biographical details or depictions by Islamic texts and early followers of Muhammad). In January 2003 {{she told the}} Dutch paper Trouw, [...] "Muhammad is, seen by our Western standards, a pervert and a tyrant", as he married, {{at the age of}} 53, Aisha, who was six years old and nine at the time the marriage was consummated. She later said: [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 'a pedophile'". Muslims filed a religious discrimination suit against her that year. The civil court in The Hague acquitted Hirsi Ali of any charges, but said that she [...] "could have made a better choice of words".|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; {{that is why}} I know it," [...] {{returned}} the Scarecrow. [...] "If it required brains to figure it out, <b>I</b> never <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> rank. You cannot lose that;--but your {{station in}} the world, the respect of all around you, the--the--the--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have less}} frontal {{development}} than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> expected,' <b>said</b> he, at last. 'It {{is a dangerous}} habit to finger loaded firearms {{in the pocket of}} one's dressing-gown.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'—I should have used 'influence.' I think that would have been more appropriate. I should not have said 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted to know if he spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{beg your}} pardon, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{that you had}} {{accepted}} my affront. [...] . I admit it was an affront; I did not think to apologise, but I do, I ask your pardon; {{it will not be}} so again, I pass you my word of honour. [...] . <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that I admired your magnanimity with—this—offender,” Archie concluded with a gulp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why! <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{this was}} the country of all others for movements, and social work, and--and--cranks--" [...] he paused.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Faith! {{not that}} I know of,' said Loveday, reflecting. 'I didn't say {{a single thing}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{naturally}} <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> on purpose to give no offence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, ma'am," [...] replied her son, [...] "I {{consider}} your {{expression of the}} least ceremonious: Miss Home <b>I</b> <b>should</b> certainly <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> in venturing {{to speak of the}} gentlewoman to whom I allude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>said</b> a word, nor fancied any wrong. Of course she'll marry some one. And I don't {{know why}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ever wish {{that it should}} not be you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. Exactly, sir. Well, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it was yourself, sir; but I {{suppose it}} was the other Mr. Carnegie." ...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{that great}} artists work unconsciously, {{that they were}} 'wiser than they knew,' as, I think, Emerson remarks somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon," [...] hastily {{explained}} Miss Gentle, [...] "I don't mean frightened, of course; perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> alarmed, or agitated--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} cannot help it, and I am wrong to taunt you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> taunted you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> will not endure the {{suspicion}} either of a Christian or of a Jew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Brisbane, I {{beg your}} pardon; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> did." [...] He turned to Brisbane. [...] "I am sorry I spoke so harshly, sir. You are {{an older man}} than I, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} to you yet, only it pained {{me to think that}} there was anything between you--any aversion, I mean. I thought that if you knew, you would try and overcome it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! Indeed, I {{should have}} objected to her presence; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{she was a}} young lady out of her proper place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--that's {{just the}} question. If anybody had asked me, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{that you were}} the man of all men whom I could have best trusted." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the time}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> the epigram was as true {{as it was}} cruel, but I suppose we none of us quite know each other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing to}} her; but Cherry is not well, and {{everything}} is at sixes and sevens; but there, never mind,' as the tears started into the sick boy's eyes, 'we'll manage; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> anything about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Waddle;--it's true. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it. Perhaps {{you do not}} quite {{understand}} me, but your position {{is one of a}} single stick, rather than of the faggot. Ah me! She hasn't been at the shop lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> expected," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Hawley, {{mounting}} his horse. [...] "Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle John's!" [...] Martha cried {{with sharp}} surprise. [...] "If {{it had to}} be one or the other, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> Uncle Robert. But Uncle John!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; I must go too," [...] {{said the}} girl wistfully, forlornly. She had tears in her voice, tears of despair and vexation, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you were}} with Clark in Illinois?" [...] said the Baron, craftily. [...] "Pardon me, Mr. Ritchie, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that you are too young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To me,' {{observed}} Miss Fanny, 'they are excessively gratifying--inexpressibly so. The {{relief of}} finding {{that you have}} no objection to make, Mrs General, quite takes a load off my mind, I am sure. I hardly know what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done,' <b>said</b> Fanny, 'if you had interposed any objection, Mrs General.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so. It was very wrong; but, then, {{why did you}} ask so foolish a question? Did I not tell you to let there be an end of it? And now will you {{let me give you}} one little bit of advice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{certainly}} {{seems to be}} a use and pleasure in never sitting down three minutes without that carpet-work, which <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> suspected,' <b>said</b> Elizabeth.|$|R
6000|$|Colville laughed. [...] "Crude in looks? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> Miss Graham {{was rather}} crude in mind, though I'm not sure I wouldn't have stopped at saying young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish I knew. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that I {{had seen}} every {{shilling}} {{that came into}} the house; but I know nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the oddest}} thing I ever knew in my life. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{he was the}} last man in the world for success of that kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Somewhat to the speaker's {{surprise}} {{this did}} not inflame the sensitive sceptic; he had the air of thinking thoroughly, and then he said: [...] "No, I don't think it's my friend MacIan that taught me that. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> always <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> don't like this. These people have rights." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that as {{she looked}} a strong healthy child {{she would have been}} able to walk and run about at the age of three.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{did not see}} {{how easy}} people find it to believe the same of me on the mere {{evidence}} of circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> no doubt,' <b>said</b> Leonard, deliberately.|$|R
