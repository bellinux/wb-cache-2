5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> months {{following}} Woods' admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated {{their relationships with}} him. Accenture, AT, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was then}} tasked {{to put together}} a composite unit of Shermans to relieve the 142nd RAC Regt's composite group with the 8th Indian Infantry Division, and the advance began westwards to Perugia, which fell on 20 June. On 16 June, the Horse again relieved the 142nd, this time at Bastia Umbra. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> actions that followed, new upgunned Churchill tanks arrived, with their Besa machine guns.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks {{following}} the disaster, police fed false stories {{to the press}} suggesting that hooliganism and drinking by Liverpool supporters were {{the root causes of}} the disaster. Blaming of Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990, which found that the main cause of the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police (SYP). Following the Taylor report, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of individuals or institutions. The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> {{weeks that}} followed, {{relatives}} {{and friends of the}} victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from the Greathead. The sea search for the Darlwyne wreck continued through the autumn and winter and into 1967, led by HMS Iveston. This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of Darlwyne was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS Maxim investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had lost its nets after they caught on an unidentified object.|$|E

2500|$|At low {{population}} densities, moths {{are found}} mating high above <b>the</b> ground, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest canopy. [...] Mating starts late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> copulations are short. [...] In contrast, during high-density outbreaks, mating {{takes place on}} lower vegetation, presumably because caterpillars descend to forage in less defoliated areas, where they form their pupae. [...] This high population density increases the operational sex ratio and significantly intensifies male-male competition. As a result, copulations begin earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> last longer <b>in</b> an attempt to minimize sperm competition. In addition, such high densities enhance female opportunities for being selective regarding males.|$|R
25|$|Between 1972 and 1991, 29 {{volcanic}} eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent {{volcanic eruptions}} {{in modern times}} occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people. Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years. Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made a whole world without a summer in 1815. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa {{was one of the}} deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. Nearly 40,000 deaths are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks after the volcano's destruction.|$|E

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks {{following}} the incident, a propaganda battle was waged between Boston's radicals {{and supporters of}} the government. Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, which were principally published in London {{in a bid to}} influence opinion there. The Boston Gazette version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to [...] "quell a Spirit of Liberty", and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.|$|E

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> {{weeks after}} the Baltimore Riot, {{newspapers}} and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, {{at the start of}} the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861. Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those Minutemen who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the [...] "Minutemen of '61." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the bomb}} was more {{powerful}} than the one used on Hiroshima, the effect was confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley. Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including [...] "mobilized"/conscripted students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed. Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well. Casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000 At least 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 others injured. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> months following the explosion, more people died from bomb effects. Because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a range of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1939 Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland, {{resulting in the}} partition of Polish territory between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR), Jewish communities in eastern Poland welcomed with some relief the Soviet occupation, which they saw as a [...] "lesser of two evils" [...] than openly antisemitic Nazi Germany. The image of Jews among the Belorussian and Ukrainian minorities waving red flags to welcome Soviet troops had great symbolic meaning in Polish memory of the period. Young Jews joined or organized communist militias, others organized a new, communist, temporary self-government. Such militias often disarmed and arrested Polish soldiers, policemen and other authority figures; often, Poles and the Polish states were mocked. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks following the events of September 1939, the Soviets engaged in a harsh policy of Sovietization. Polish schools and other institutions were closed, Poles were dismissed from jobs of authority, often arrested and deported, and replaced with non-Polish personnel.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of coffee on performance <b>and</b> alertness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> at night. <b>The</b> results showed that caffeinated coffee had a beneficial effect on alertness and improved performance on a variety of tasks in both <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night sessions. <b>The</b> effects were often very large. For example, at night, consumption of caffeinated coffee produced comparable alertness ratings to the day-time ratings given when juice was drunk. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> effects of caffeinated coffee, the difference between the decaffeinated coffee and juice were small and variable. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of consuming caffeinated coffee, and show that this effect is comparable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> night...|$|R

500|$|American {{casualties}} in the battle were very light, and are therefore not listed in the table below. [...] Two Virginia officers, Capt. William Washington and Lt.

[...] (Monroe, the future United States president, suffered a wound to the neck that very nearly killed him. [...] His life was saved by a doctor who volunteered his services to the army as it marched through New Jersey that morning.) Two privates {{are known to have}} died in the battle, and one account includes mention of two men dying from exposure on the march. [...] The most pessimistic estimate of American casualties lists four killed and eight wounded, although Fischer points out that many more American troops probably died of non-combat causes (including illness, hypothermia, malnutrition, and exhaustion) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> weeks following the campaign of late December and early January.|$|E
