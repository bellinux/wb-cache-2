5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human <b>evolutionary</b> <b>genetics,</b> where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

40|$|<b>Evolutionary</b> {{developmental}} <b>genetics</b> {{brings together}} systematists, morphologists and developmental geneticists; it will therefore impact {{on each of}} these component disciplines. The goals and methods of phylogenetic analysis are reviewed here, and the contribution of <b>evolutionary</b> developmental <b>genetics</b> to morphological systematics, in terms of character conceptualisation and primary homology assessment, is discussed. <b>Evolutionary</b> developmental <b>genetics,</b> like its component disciplines phylogenetic systematics and comparative morphology, is concerned with homology concepts. Phylogenetic concepts of homology and their limitations are considered here, and the need for independent homology statements at different levels of biological organisation is evaluated. The role of systematics in <b>evolutionary</b> developmental <b>genetics</b> is outlined. Phylogenetic systematics and comparative morphology will suggest effective sampling strategies to developmental geneticists. Phylogenetic systematics provides hypotheses of character evolution (including parallel evolution and convergence), stimulating investigations into the evolutionary gains and losses of morphologies. Comparative morphology identifies those structures that are not easily amenable to typological categorisation, and that may be of particular interest in terms of developmental genetics. The concepts of latent homology and genetic recall may also prove useful in the evolutionary interpretation of developmental genetic data...|$|R

25|$|A {{commonly}} used measure of genetic distance is the fixation index which varies between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that two populations are genetically identical (minimal or no genetic diversity {{between the two}} populations) whereas a value of 1 indicates that two populations are genetically different (maximum genetic diversity between the two populations). No mutation is assumed. Large populations between which there is much migration, for example, tend to be little differentiated whereas small populations between which there is little migration tend to be greatly differentiated. Fst is a convenient measure of this differentiation, {{and as a result}} Fst and related statistics are among the most widely used descriptive statistics in population and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>genetics.</b> But Fst is more than a descriptive statistic and measure of genetic differentiation. Fst {{is directly related to the}} Variance in allele frequency among populations and conversely to the degree of resemblance among individuals within populations. If Fst is small, it means that allele frequencies within each population are very similar; if it is large, it means that allele frequencies are very different.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{critics of}} this view are often {{bracketed}} together as holding a [...] "multiregional hypothesis", which was being studied in the early 1980s into the 2000s.

The elevation of the mountains west of the lake (which is currently the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, {{one of the largest}} reserves of eastern lowland (or Grauer's) gorillas in the world), combined with the elevation of the eastern rift (located in eastern Rwanda) would be responsible for drainage of water from central Rwanda in the actual Lake Kivu. This concept of [...] "proto-lake Kivu" [...] was challenged by lack of consistent geological evidence, although the cichlid's molecular clock suggests the existence of a lake much older than the commonly cited 15,000 years.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{began as}} a series of lectures at Columbia University in October and November 1936. Dobzhansky decided to attend the summer 1936 meeting of the Genetics Society of America in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. When the {{geneticist}} Leslie Dunn learned of this, he invited Dobzhansky to give a series of lectures at Columbia. He sent the invitation in April, and within a month he had suggested that the lectures be a springboard for writing a general treatise on <b>evolutionary</b> <b>genetics.</b> Dobzhansky was enthusiastic, and in May he wrote back, proposing the title [...] "Genetics and the Origin of Species". He envisioned two parts [...] "part I containing data on the sources of evolutionary change, and part II containing a discussion of their interactions leading to race- and species formation." [...] After the lectures (for which he received $500), Dobzhansky returned to Pasadena, and in December Columbia University Press accepted his proposal for a book. The pace of writing was helped by a riding accident in February 1937 in which he crushed his knee, rendering him immobile; and by April he was able to send a manuscript to Dunn for his perusal.|$|E

2500|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species {{provided}} the outline for {{a synthesis of}} genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation {{of the field of}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>genetics,</b> and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology, systematics and botany in a series of notable books: Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) by Ernst Mayr; Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and Variation and Evolution in Plants (1950) by G. Ledyard Stebbins. The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by Julian Huxley in his book, [...] In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete. Developmental biologists did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and {{it was not until the}} 1970s and 1980s that molecular biology bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole.|$|E
