Diatomaceous earth powder is inserted into the vacuum space to aid in the effectiveness of vacuum insulation. It was used in the Classical AGA Cookers as a thermal heat barrier.|$|E

50|$|The British siege {{operation}} proceeded throughout September, often {{under heavy}} fire. British batteries moved progressively {{closer to the}} walls, inflicting heavy damage within the city. The hospital had to be <b>evacuated,</b> and the <b>powder</b> magazine (a particular target of the British guns) was also emptied. On 19 September a British cannonball killed {{the commander of the}} French artillery. By 24 September breaches were beginning to show in the bastions under attack, and by 6 October the British trenches had reached the inner ditches, with additional gun batteries doing significant damage along the entire French works.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{investigation}} {{was made on}} the heat transport through insulation <b>powder</b> <b>evacuated</b> under high vacuum, in which an aluminium powder was added for radiation shield. Experiments on heat flux in the powder were carried out from room temperature down to liquefied Belgium temperature, which enabled us to examine {{the relation between the}} heat flux and temperature. Furthermore, the general solution for total heat transfer for combined radiation and conduction proposed by Wang and Tien was applied to the powder, and was compared with the experimental results. We then quantitatively determined the roles of the contribution from both radiation and conduction and the effect of added aluminium powder, and investigated the basic heat transfer mechanism in the powder at low temperatures such as extinction coefficient for radiation and contact conduction between particles...|$|R
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium <b>powder,</b> <b>evacuating</b> the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} represents all of {{the natural}} and artificial factors created through human actions, which in tight interaction, they are influencing the biological equilibrium determining the life conditions for the human being and the society developing. The technical progress brings along, besides so many wonderful achievements, numerous drawbacks and a lot of polluting substances, which may destroy the environment. The environment polluting has became a contemporary, social-economic problem which has taken so big proportions, that required adopting some laws to reduce its harmful actions. The quantification of the human activity effects and the natural processes on the environment, the health and security of the human being, as well as goods of any kind are achieved by assessing the impact on the environment. The paper presents the way the thermo-electric centrals influence the environment by evacuating in the atmosphere the polluting substances resulted from the burning of fuel in the energetic boilers. There are analyzed the noxa emissions for the combined heat and power plant of Suceava. The central was projected to work on solid fuel (lignite from the Rovinari basin)  combined with fuel oil for stabilizing the burning. Between 1999 - 2001 people have been working on repairs at the energetic boilers by upgrading from the lignite operating to the pitcoal operating. The pitcoal is imported from Russia, Ukraine, Australia, South Africa.  The source of air polluting is the emission in atmosphere of the polluting contained in the burning gases resulted from burning the fuel in the focus of energetic boilers (SO 2, NOx, CO 2, powders). The direct impact of the polluting (SO 2, NOx, CO 2, <b>powders),</b> <b>evacuated</b> in the atmosphere by the burning installation, takes place in areas relatively close to the central, on distances from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers (by affecting the air quality and solid, acid deposition on the soil), this depends of the evacuated polluting quantity and the climatic factors in the area. The gas polluting emission effects can manifest on wide areas, at noticeable distances from the source (some hundreds of kilometers) by the acid rain apparition (because of the SO 2 emissions) and even at global scale through contribution to the sere effect (because of the CO 2 emissions). The thermal power plants in Romania were built during a period in which their {{impact on the environment}} was undervalued and constraints relating to environmental protection were relatively few. The location has been chosen most often by other criteria (sources of cooling water, fuel, energy consumers) and less after the environmental impact. Stack height was considered a means (only) effective to prevent air pollution in the neighboring area, the dispersion of the combustion gases over a large area around the plant.  For the case the combined heat and power plant of Suceava is observed that exceeded the maximum permissible limits for the pollutants SO 2, NOx, and particulates in the combustion gases discharged, compared with the limit imposed by GD 541 / 2003. Solution with high funnel is no longer sufficient and that the rules will be supplemented with measures to limit emissions into the atmosphere for each noxa separately. </p...|$|R
