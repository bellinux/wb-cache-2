5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 2011, it was {{announced}} that a new Halloween film, at the time titled Halloween 3D, would be released on October 26, 2012. At the time of the announcement, there was no director or writer attached to the project. Originally, Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer were labeled as writers but dropped out due to their occupancy on the Hellraiser reboot. There was no confirmation <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> script had been written or if any cast or crew members from previous films in the series would be involved. The film was dropped from the release schedule on October 26, 2012, as no work had progressed on the film.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{not without}} {{precedent}} in Major League baseball: the Dauvray Cup (named after actress Helen Dauvray) was awarded to {{the winner of the}} World Series between the National League and the American Association from 1887 to 1890, and from 1891 to 1893, when a solitary major league remained, to the winner of the National League pennant. The Dauvray Cup was to be held by the victorious team, and was to be relinquished the following year when (and <b>if)</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> champion team emerged. The Dauvray Cup mysteriously vanished following the 1893 series and has never been located. From 1894 to 1897, the Temple Cup was awarded to the winner of a postseason contest between the two top National League clubs.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E

5|$|At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo {{president}} Satoru Iwata {{announced that}} the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement {{was a surprise to}} Sakurai, who left HAL Laboratory in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another Smash Bros. game, despite the fact that Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Smash game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a private meeting with him, where he was asked to be involved as Brawls director. Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Help from a variety of studios such as Monolith Soft and Paon was enlisted, with Game Arts as the main team in the preliminary development stages. In addition, several Smash Bros. staff members that resided {{in the area of the}} new office joined the project. Altogether, roughly 100 individuals worked on the project full-time, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> class of locomotives was to be built, {{it would have to}} satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ {{stated that}} they would {{discontinue}} Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company had never made a profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. The {{only part of the}} service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB stated that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E

5|$|Originally, a rectory {{was located}} on the site, which {{provided}} {{a home for the}} rector who officiated in the private chapel of St. Nicholas in the Beauchamp manor house nearby. When the rector, Henry de Wyk, resigned in 1304, the lord of the manor, John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp, established a chantry and founded a college for five chaplains. It is suggested in the English Heritage listing that the rectory was probably already owned by the Beauchamps, but if not they purchased it upon de Wyk's departure. The college was composed of four priests governed by a provost, and was attached to the manor house chapel. A National Trust report referenced in the Historic Environment Record could not determine if the pre-1304 rectory was retained for the college's use, or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> building was erected instead.|$|E

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The Seahawks {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999. In 1995 a {{proposal}} was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> stadium could be built {{and said that the}} team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.|$|E
