5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
5|$|Lester becomes {{infatuated}} with Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine {{at a high}} school basketball game with Jane. He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival, Buddy Kane. When Lester's boss and efficiency expert, Brad, tells him that he is to be laid off, Lester instead blackmails him for $60,000 and quits his job. Lester continues his liberation by taking a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant, trading his Toyota Camry for a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> in shape. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky. The girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky. Jane and Ricky bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag being blown in the wind.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E

25|$|The post of a farba {{was very}} prestigious, and his {{descendants}} could inherit {{it with the}} mansas approval. The mansa could also replace a farba <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out of control, {{as in the case}} of Diafunu.|$|E
25|$|Turner was {{concerned}} {{also with the}} situation of Cyprus and in February 1958 declared that he would rejoin the Parliamentary Conservative Party <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> an undertaking that the Government would not weaken their attitude there. By June 1958, Turner and the remaining Independent Conservatives declared that they now agreed with the Government's foreign policy, and the five wrote to ask to be readmitted to the Conservative whip. After seeing Edward Heath, his application was approved.|$|E
25|$|Viscera began wrestling in {{pajamas and}} making overtly sexual {{gestures}} in the ring. He became smitten with Raw ring announcer Lilian Garcia and tried different tactics to seduce her every week. At Vengeance in June, Garcia finally reciprocated, proposing {{to him in}} the center of the ring, only to be turned down and left crying in the ring when The Godfather arrived with many of his hos to show Viscera what he would be leaving behind <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> married.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, {{two years}} after his father's death, Villeneuve asked his mother if he could follow his father's {{footsteps}} and go motor racing. His mother, Joann, promised she {{would allow him to}} drive a kart <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> good marks in one of his weakest subjects, mathematics. Villeneuve applied himself at school and soon got the marks he required for his mother to fulfill her promise. A year later, Joann allowed him to drive a 100cc kart at a kart track in Imola. The owners of the track, Luigi and Massimo Buratti, were impressed by the Canadian and after proving himself in a 100cc machine, he moved up to the 135cc version before, on the same day, being allowed onto the Grand Prix circuit with a Formula Four car.|$|E
500|$|His manager Terry Francona said, [...] "He's {{taking more}} of what the {{pitchers}} give him, using the whole field. He's going to work the count {{about as good as}} any hitter in baseball. Last year <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a two-strike breaking ball, he might swing and miss. This year he's fouling it off, or taking it to right field." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams was {{promoted}} captain on 5January 1916. He was appointed a flight commander in No.1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which was initially numbered 67Squadron Royal Flying Corps by the British. The unit departed Australia in March 1916 without any aircraft; {{after arriving in}} Egypt it received B.E.2 fighters, a type deficient in speed and manoeuvrability, and which lacked forward-firing machine guns. Williams wrote that in combat with the German Fokkers, [...] "our fighting in the air was of short duration but could mean a quick end", and that {{when it came to}} bombing, he and his fellow pilots [...] "depended mainly on luck". He further quoted a truism in the Flying Corps that [...] "if a new pilot got through his first three days without being shot down he was lucky; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through three weeks he was doing well and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through three months he was set. Williams and the other Australians were initially involved in isolated tasks around the Suez Canal, attached to various Royal Flying Corps (RFC) units. No.1 Squadron began to operate concertedly in December 1916, supporting the Allied advance on Palestine. Williams completed his RFC attachment in February 1917.|$|E

After waiting five days longer than planned, Clark decided to leave Wheeling without Lochry because men were deserting the expedition, and Clark believed that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> them further away from home, they would be less inclined to run off. When Lochry finally reached Wheeling on August 8, he found that Clark had departed {{only a few hours}} earlier. Lochry sent the following message to Clark: ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{asked me}} if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up into the body all the time, so that Bradman had to play his shots to leg. [...] "Yes, I think that can be done", I said... I had no doubt of its purpose: we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls, and we {{reasoned}} that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{a lot of them}} he would be... intimidated and eventually, having to direct his shots to leg all the time, would give a catch to one of the [...] fieldsmen".|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, it was {{revealed}} Jackson's will named Diana Ross as the next-in-line guardian for his children, after his mother, Katherine. In September 2009, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach released a book based on taped conversations he had with Jackson in 2001. It included Jackson's thoughts on personal relationships in general and specific ones. His romantic feelings for two famous friends were widely cited in the media; when asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> jealous when his long-time friend Elizabeth Taylor dated other men, he replied, [...] "Yes and no. I know that if we ever did anything romantically the press would be so mean and nasty and call us the Odd Couple. It would turn into a circus and that's the pain of it all." ...|$|E

500|$|This bout was {{followed}} by a WrestleMania 21 rematch that involved Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle. In a brawling match, Angle had an Ankle Lock [...] applied on Michaels. Moments later, however, Michaels recuperated and performed Sweet Chin Music on Angle before pinning Angle for the win. After the match, both men were given a standing ovation. An in-ring segment took place next between Raw's ring announcer, Lilian Garcia and Viscera. During the segment, Garcia proposed to Viscera. Before Viscera could have given an answer, he was interrupted by The Godfather. The Godfather gave Viscera advice about the life he would miss out on <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> married. This led to Viscera rejecting Garcia's marriage proposal and leaving the ring with the Godfather's hos and abandoning a crying Garcia in the ring.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Up Yer News, Bathurst auditioned for a one-off {{television}} comedy called Joking Apart. Earlier in the day, {{he noticed a}} fellow Up Yer News performer reading the script to prepare for his own audition. As Bathurst went into the audition room, his colleague was leaving and told Bathurst he would [...] "break his legs" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the part, a threat that seemed not to be [...] "entirely jocular". Bathurst got the part and the pilot of Joking Apart was broadcast as an installment of the BBC 2 Comic Asides strand. It returned for two series in 1993 and 1995. Bathurst appeared as sitcom writer Mark Taylor in the series. After the first series was broadcast, a critic called Bathurst the [...] "Best Comedy Newcomer of 1993".|$|E
500|$|Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales, on [...] 1910. Scott, {{detained}} by expedition business, sailed later on a faster passenger liner {{and joined the}} ship in South Africa. In Melbourne, Australia, he left the ship to continue fund-raising, while Terra Nova proceeded to New Zealand. Waiting for Scott in Melbourne was a telegram from Amundsen, informing Scott that the Norwegian was [...] "proceeding south"; the telegram was the first indication to Scott {{that he was in}} a race. When asked by the press for a reaction, Scott replied that his plans would not change and that he would not sacrifice the expedition's scientific goals to win the race to the Pole. In his diary he wrote that Amundsen had a fair chance of success, and perhaps deserved his luck <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through.|$|E

500|$|In Super Bowl XL in February 2006, the Steelers faced a tough test in slowing Seattle Seahawks All-Pro {{running back}} Shaun Alexander {{who ran for}} 1,880 yards and scored an NFL record 28 touchdowns {{in the regular season}} behind an {{offensive}} line that featured All-Pro linemen Walter Jones and Steve Hutchinson on the left side. [...] The defensive line would need to slow down the Seahawks running attack to keep the Steelers in the game, a challenge which Mitchell took personally. [...] The players came through holding Alexander under the 100-yard plateau and most importantly preventing him from scoring, which was crucial to a Steelers win. [...] After the game, Mitchell said of the strategy, [...] "Our thing was 'keep him out of the end zone.' We [...] didn't care <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> 300 yards; don't let him in the end zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Yardley {{then called}} upon the {{occasional}} leg spin of Hutton {{in an attempt}} to exploit the turning wicket. The latter had taken only four wickets in the 1947 English season and had never dismissed an Australian batsman in ten Tests against such opponents. As Australia were still behind the required run rate, Yardley could afford to take risks and sacrifice some runs <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> wickets in return. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours from Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as [...] "rather terrible" [...] due to the errant length. This over took Morris to 51. After an economical over from Compton, Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost holing out to Yardley. Despite the near miss, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 96/1 from 90 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The Jets {{had high}} hopes for 1999, but {{suffered}} a blow in the season opener when Testaverde ruptured his Achilles tendon and was lost for the season. New York suffered other injuries and fell to a 2–6 record before recovering to finish 8–8. Two days {{after the end of}} the season, Parcells announced his resignation as coach; he remained with the team for a year as chief of football operations. Belichick was slated to become head coach in Parcells' place, but one day later, he announced his own resignation. [...] Robert Kraft had gotten word to Belichick through intermediaries that he could have complete control of football operations and a $2 million salary <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out of his contract with the Jets. After a lawsuit to void Belichick's contract failed and Tagliabue refused to release him, the Jets and Patriots agreed on draft choice compensation for the Jets.|$|E
