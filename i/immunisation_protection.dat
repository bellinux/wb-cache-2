40|$|Replication-defective and replication-competent {{recombinant}} human adenovirus type 5 vectors efficiently expressed the glycoprotein D (gD) or the transmembrane anchor truncated gD (tgD) of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV- 1) in vitro. To facilitate {{the evaluation of}} the efficacy of immunisation with these recombinant adenoviruses in conferring protection against BHV- 1 infection, a cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) model for intranasal BHV- 1 challenge was developed. I used this model to assess the ability of different routes of immunisation with the recombinant adenoviruses to elicit gD-specific systemic and mucosal immunity and confer protection against BHV- 1 challenge. Immunisation with gD-expressing vectors induced better immunity and protection than immunisation with tgD-expressing viruses. Mucosal immunisation with the replication-competent virus was more efficient than that with the replication-defective vector in inducing gD-specific antibody in the serum and the respiratory tract. In contrast, systemic immunisation with the two vectors stimulated similar gD-specific antibody levels. These results indicate that the route of immunisation was crucial when assessing the efficacy of recombinant adenoviruses as vaccine vectors. The importance of the route of administration was further demonstrated by the finding that intranasal immunisation with the replication-competent vector stimulated higher antigen-specific IgA levels and antibody-secreting cell numbers in the respiratory tract than intradermal, intraperitoneal or enteric <b>immunisation.</b> <b>Protection</b> correlated with gD-specific antibody levels such that intranasal immunisation, even 3 months following vaccination, conferred complete, while intradermal or enteric immunisation conferred partial protection of the lungs of cotton rats against intranasal BHV- 1 challenge. Pre-existing active adenovirus-specific immunity significantly inhibited the development of gD-specific antibody responses and protection against BHV- 1 challenge following immunisation with recombinant adenovirus, while only a slight inhibition was observed by passive transfer of adenovirus-specific antibody. Overall, the results demonstrated that mucosal and systemic immunisation with adenovirus vectors could induce antigen-specific immunity and protection against BHV- 1 challenge. The level of gD-specific immune responses and protection from challenge were, however, dependent on the cellular localisation of the foreign gene expressed by the vectors, the replication-capability of the viruses, the route of immunisation and {{the presence or absence of}} pre-existing adenovirus-specific immunity in the cotton rat...|$|E
40|$|In two studies, pneumococcal {{polysaccharide}} (Pnc PS) vaccine {{was given}} to more than 400 pregnant Papua New Guinean women. No deleterious effects were found. The vaccine prevented acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) among offspring in utero or aged 1 - 17 months {{at the time of}} maternal <b>immunisation,</b> suggesting <b>protection</b> through breast feeding. Serum IgG antibody titres were higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated groups for 2 - 4 months after delivery and no immune suppression, evaluated by the response to subsequent Pnc PS vaccination, was detected. Breast milk IgA to four serotypes was 1. 1 - 1. 8 times higher in immunised than unimmunised women for 6 months postpartum. Given results from several developing countries, large-scale safety and efficacy trials are now justified. Postpartum maternal immunisation is another intervention under consideration...|$|R
40|$|Since 2013, rabies {{cases have}} been {{reported}} among Formosan ferret badgers in Taiwan, {{and they have been}} shown to be the major reservoirs for Taiwanese enzootics. To control and eradicate rabies, the authorities plan to implement a vaccination programme. Before distributing live vaccines in the field, this study assessed the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of SAG 2 vaccine on ferret badgers by direct oral instillation. After application of 109 TCID 50 /dose, no virus was excreted into the oral cavity 1 - 7 days post-application, and safety was also satisfactorily verified over a 266 -day period. Moreover, despite the low level of rabies virus neutralising antibodies induced after vaccination of a 108 TCID 50 /dose, the efficacy assessment revealed a 100 % survival rate (15 / 15) of vaccinees and an 87. 5 % fatality rate (7 / 8) in control animals after a challenge on the 198 th day post-vaccination. The <b>immunisation</b> and <b>protection</b> rates obtained more than 6 months after a single vaccination dose demonstrated that SAG 2 is an ideal vaccine candidate to protect Formosan ferret badgers against rabies in Taiwan...|$|R

While difficult to express, the proteins VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10 are immunogenic components of the outer membrane type IV secretion system that {{have been identified as}} candidate antigens for vaccines targeting of A. marginale. Soluble VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10 were successfully expressed using Pichia pastoris. When formulated with the self-adjuvanting silica vesicles, SV- 100 (diameter: 50 nm, and pore entrance size: 6 nm), 200 µg of VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10 were adsorbed per milligram of nanoparticle. The VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10, SV- 100 formulations were shown to induce higher antibody responses in mice compared to the QuilA formulations. Moreover, intracellular staining of selected cytokines demonstrated that both VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10 formulations induced cell-mediated immune responses in mice. Importantly, the SV- 100 VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 10 complexes were shown to specifically stimulate bovine T-cell linages derived from calves immunised with A. marginale outer membrane fractions, suggesting formulations will be useful for bovine <b>immunisation</b> and <b>protection</b> studies. Overall this study demonstrates the potential of self-adjuvanting silica vesicle formulations to address current deficiencies in vaccine delivery applications...|$|R
40|$|Why we must {{invest in}} health workers to end {{maternal}} and child malnutrition Summary Malnutrition 1 is an underlying cause {{of an estimated}} 45 % of child deaths. Poor maternal nutrition is also a contributing factor to maternal, infant and child mortality. Building long-term, sustainable solutions to reduce malnutrition is therefore essential for child survival and ending preventable child deaths. Breaking the cycle of hunger and malnutrition over the long-term requires a multi-sectoral approach that addresses food security, the affordability and availability of nutritious foods, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), preventive health services such as <b>immunisation,</b> and social <b>protection.</b> But to reduce mortality and poor health being caused by malnutrition now, we also need universal coverage of a package of 13 effective, direct interventions for preventing and treating malnutrition. Together, they {{have been identified as}} able to stop 25 % of deaths in children under 5. Health workers are essential for getting these interventions to the children who need them. The children at greatest risk of malnutrition are also the ones least likely to see a health worker...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown in rodent malaria models that {{immunisation}} with genetically attenuated Plasmodium parasites can confer sterile protection against challenge with virulent parasites. For the mass production of live attenuated Plasmodium parasites for vaccination, safety is a prerequisite. Knockout of a single gene is not sufficient for such a strategy since the parasite can likely compensate for such a genetic modification and a single surviving parasite is sufficient to kill an immunised individual. Parasites must therefore be at least double-attenuated when generating a safe vaccine strain. Genetic double-attenuation can be achieved by knocking out two essential genes or by combining a single gene knockout with the expression of a protein toxic for the parasite. We generated a double-attenuated Plasmodium berghei strain that is deficient in fatty acid synthesis by the knockout of the pdh-e 1 α gene, introducing a second attenuation by the liver stage-specific expression of the pore-forming bacterial toxin perfringolysin O. With this double genetically attenuated parasite strain, a superior attenuation was indeed achieved compared with single-attenuated strains that were either deficient in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) -E 1 or expressed perfringolysin O. In vivo, both single-attenuated strains resulted in breakthrough infections even if low to moderate doses of sporozoites (2, 000 - 5, 000) were administered. In contrast, the double genetically attenuated parasite strain, given at moderate doses of 5, 000 sporozoites, did not result in blood stage infection and even when administered at 5 - to 20 -fold higher doses, only single and delayed breakthrough infections were observed. Prime booster immunisation with the double genetically attenuated parasite strain completely protected a susceptible mouse strain from malaria and even a single <b>immunisation</b> conferred <b>protection</b> in some cases and lead to a markedly delayed onset of blood stage infection in others. Importantly, premature rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane by liver stage-specific perfringolysin O expression did not induce host cell death and soluble parasite proteins, which are released into the host cell cytoplasm, have the potential to be processed and presented via MHC class I molecules. This, in turn, might support immunological responses against Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|The current {{worldwide}} {{epidemic of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection {{is a huge}} global health problem. Widespread BCG vaccination remains a useful tool in combating this epidemic; however, its variable efficacy requires urgent development of novel vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Such a candidate vaccine is a serotype 5 adenovirus expressing antigen 85 A from M tuberculosis (Ad 85 A). In animal models Ad 85 A confers significant protection when administered intra-nasally. The work in this thesis demonstrates that intra-nasal immunisation with Ad 85 A results in inhibition of M tuberculosis growth in the lung early after infection, {{in contrast to the}} late inhibition induced by parenterally administered vaccines. Early inhibition correlates with the presence in the lung of a highly activated population of antigen-specific CD 8 T cells, maintained for at least 6 months post-immunisation by persistent antigen. For intra-nasal Ad 85 A to be effective, the vaccine must be delivered into the lower respiratory tract, as immunisation targeting only the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) does not result in protection. Following a change of animal facility, the lung immune response to intra-dermal immunisation with Ad 85 A increased and this route of <b>immunisation</b> now induced <b>protection,</b> though growth of M tuberculosis was inhibited only late after infection. However, this response and protection can be altered by exposure to environmental mycobacteria. Further experiments showed that simultaneous respiratory and parenteral immunisations (SIM) act additively, where local lung immunity inhibits the growth of M tuberculosis early after infection and systemic immunity protects later. SIM regimes generate greatly improved <b>protection</b> over either <b>immunisation</b> alone and do not depend on priming and boosting. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVirulent {{strains of}} Rhodococcus equi {{have a large}} plasmid of 80 – 90 kb, which encodes several virulence-associated {{proteins}} (Vap), including VapA, a lipoprotein highly associated with disease. We have previously demonstrated that oral immunisation with attenuated Salmonella enterica Typhimurium strain expressing the antigen VapA (STM VapA+) induces specific and long-term humoral and cellular immunity against R. equi. It was shown that VapA activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) on macrophages by establishing an interaction that ultimately favours immunity against R. equi infection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the immune response triggered by nasal immunisation with STM VapA+ and to determine whether TLR 2 supports the vaccine effect. We developed an optimised protocol for a single nasal <b>immunisation</b> that conferred <b>protection</b> against R. equi infection in mice, which was manifested by efficient R. equi clearance in challenged animals. Nasal vaccination with STM VapA+ has also induced protection in Tlr 2 −/− mice and mice with non-functional TLR 4. Moreover, spleen cells of vaccinated mice augmented T-bet expression, as well as the production of IL- 12, IFN-γ, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Notably, the population of CD 4 + T cells with memory phenotype significantly increased in the spleens of vaccinated mice challenged 1 or 5 months after immunisation. In these animals, the spleen bacterial burden was also reduced. When similar experimental procedures were performed in TLR 2 knockout mice, an increase in CD 4 + T cells with memory phenotype was not observed. Consequently, we conclude that nasal vaccination with attenuated Salmonella expressing the R. equi virulence factor VapA confers long-lasting protection against experimental rhodoccocosis and that TLR 2 engagement was not crucial to induce this protection but may be required for a long-term immune response...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is {{a member}} of the {{pneumovirus}} genus (family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae). RSV is an important respiratory virus of both infants and the elderly, representing an underappreciated burden on health care systems. In addition, re-infections can occur despite the presence of pre-existing immunity, suggesting that immunological memory to RSV is incomplete. To date, treatment of RSV infection is limited to the provision of supportive care and no effective vaccine is available. Although several are currently under investigation, these candidates focus upon the delivery of the F and G antigens of RSV to stimulate the immune system, rather than the internal antigens, which may provide cross protection between different subtypes of RSV. Vaccine development has been greatly hindered by the lack of an appropriate animal model in which to study vaccine efficacy and pneumovirus pathogenesis. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is also a member of the Pneumovirus genus and, like RSV infection of humans, causes a bronchiolitis and fatal pneumonia in its natural host, the mouse. PVM has been proposed as an appropriate model system in which to both study pneumovirus pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. The PVM model system was adapted to investigate a potential vaccination strategy to address the lack of an available RSV vaccine. Replication deficient recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd 5) vectors were constructed which expressed the F, M and N genes of PVM J 3666, in addition to a control construct, which expressed the LacZ gene of E. coli. The constructs were administered via the intranasal route to BALB/c mice and were able to elicit complete protection against a lethal dose of pathogenic PVM J 3666, in both short-term experiments and in a long-term experiment, up to 20 weeks post <b>immunisation.</b> The <b>protection</b> effect elicited by the constructs was observed when administered in a single dose, and in alternative mouse strains, C 3 H/He-mg and C 57 BL/ 6, which had differing immunity haplotypes. The rAd 5 vectors generated a PVM specific IgG humoral response to PVM and Ad 5 antigen which did not correlate as the primary mediator of protection. The rAd 5 candidate expressing the N gene of PVM was shown to induce IFNγ secreting T-cells. The use of a peptide library of PVM N protein determined that a specific response could be identified towards the amino acids N 41 - 90, N 81 - 130, N 161 - 210 and N 281 - 330. Thus, the PVM infection model of BALB/c mice provides an immunological platform to facilitate the study of RSV and PVM pathogenesis, immunology and vaccine development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was the {{development}} and testing of NDV-AIV recombinants respectively. Using reverse genetics the H 9 -ORF of the LPAIV strain A/turkey/Wisconsin/ 1 / 66 (H 9 N 2) was inserted into the intergenic region between the F and HN genes of NDV Clone 30 and an infectious virus was generated. Inserting an additional transcription unit led to a delay of replication but the final titers were comparable to the parent virus. Expression of the foreign gene was demonstrated using indirect immunofluorescence (IFT), Western blot analysis (WB) and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIP). The insert remained stable after ten passages in eggs. No increase in virulence resulting from the additional expression of the H 9 protein in NDV was registered, neither in the ICPI nor post immunisation of turkeys and SPF chickens. A single immunisation of SPF chickens with NDV expressing H 9 induced protection against clinical symptoms after a lethal infection with velogenic NDV and reduced the excretion of the virus. A single immunisation with NDV-H 9 resulted in partial protection of turkeys against clinical symptoms but virus excretion was not significantly reduced in comparison to naive animals. However, neither in SPF chickens nor in turkeys were H 9 specific antibodies detectable after <b>immunisation.</b> Therefore no <b>protection</b> against clinical symptoms after challenge infection with A/turkey/Wisconsin/ 1 / 66 (H 9 N 2) was induced. Immunised and AIV-naive SPF chickens and turkeys displayed differences in clinical symptoms and virus excretion, but most differences were not significant. Protective efficacy against the HPAIV H 5 infection after a single immunisation with NDV expressing AIV hemagglutinin and neuraminidase was also investigated. Animals immunised with NDV expressing N 1 revealed prolonged survival {{in comparison to the}} control group after challenge infection with HPAIV H 5 N 1 indicating a contribution of N 1 to protective immunity. Furthermore NDV expressing HPAIV H 5 (NDV-H 5) or HPAIV H 5 modified by deletion of the polybasic cleavage site (NDV-H 5 LP), or coexpressing H 5 and N 1 were evaluated for their protective efficacy after challenge infection with homologous (A/whooper swan/Germany/R 65 / 06 (H 5 N 1)) or heterologous (A/duck/Vietnam/TG 24 - 01 / 05 (H 5 N 1); A/chicken/Italy/ 8 / 98 (H 5 N 2)) HPAI viruses. A single immunisation of SPF chickens with either one of these recombinants induced protection against clinical signs after homologous HPAIV challenge infection and inhibited virus excretion. After challenge infection with heterologous HPAIV H 5 N 1 all immunised animals displayed few clinical symptoms, low mortality, and a low level of virus excretion. After challenge infection with heterologous HPAIV H 5 N 2 all immunised animals remained healthy and the low level of virus excretion was close to the detection limit, whereas naive animals excreted high levels of viral RNA and 90 % died. The recombinants (NDV-H 5, NDV-H 5 LP, and NDV-H 5 N 1) thus demonstrated a high level of protection against homologous and heterologous HPAIV H 5 challenges without any differences between one another. Additionally chickens immunised with NDV expressing H 5 or N 1 could be distinguished from infected animals by the absence of AIV NP specific antibodies...|$|R
