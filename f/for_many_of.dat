5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing {{into the hands of}} foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E

The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E

5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Balzac's characters.

There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E

5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his eleven seasons, Hutson {{was also}} the Packers' kicker.

He {{led the league in}} extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in field goals made in 1943. As did almost all players in his day, Hutson played both offense and defense. On defense, he played safety and intercepted 30 passes over the final six years of his career. His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.|$|E
