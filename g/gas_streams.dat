40|$|The {{delivery}} of powder to the melt pool via the nozzle {{is a crucial}} element at laser material deposition. It has {{a major influence on}} the consumption of powder material {{and the quality of the}} coating layer. In order to ensure consistently high process stability and quality, it is necessary to check the powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> at regular intervals. In considering a powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream,</b> the important variables that need to be monitored includes the symmetry of the powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> and the position and size of the powder focus. In order to measure the requisite variables, the powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> is illuminated from the side using a laser line and monitored by a coaxially aligned camera through the powder nozzle. A high image rate allows the number and position of individual powder particles to be recorded. Relevant algorithms are used to calculate the particle density distribution from these images. The spatial particle density distribution of the powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> can be calculate d by superimposing individual levels along the powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b> The measurement principle was successfully tested on various powder nozzles. The measurement process makes it possible to fully characterize a powder <b>gas</b> <b>stream...</b>|$|R
50|$|In the CrystaSulf process, a heavy {{hydrocarbon}} liquid is pumped through an absorber where the liquid contacts the <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> that contains H2S. The H2S is absorbed from the <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> and the clean <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> then exits the absorber.

25|$|Particulate {{scrubbers}} Wet scrubber {{is a form}} {{of pollution}} control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{what is seen}} is not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} that are consistent only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with other <b>gas</b> <b>streams,</b> interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E
500|$|Lithium {{chloride}} and {{lithium bromide}} are hygroscopic {{and are used}} as desiccants for <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> [...] Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.|$|E

50|$|A {{deoxygenation}} tower {{brings the}} injection water {{into contact with}} a dry <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> (<b>gas</b> is always readily available in the oilfield). The filtered water drops into the de-oxygenation tower, splashing onto a series of trays, causing dissolved oxygen to be lost to the <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|R
50|$|Particles of {{different}} sizes have different health effects. Inertial separators are used to eliminate particles outside of the desired size range. If a <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> containing particles {{of different}} sizes is forced to turn a sharp corner, the inertia of the large particles causes them to separate from the <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> lines. The larger particles can be collected and removed from the <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> after collisions with {{the walls of the}} vessel.|$|R

2500|$|New X-ray {{observations}} by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show {{three distinct}} structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, {{and a hot}} central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around Eta Carinae are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. [...] "The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays," [...] says Prof. Kris Davidson of the University of Minnesota. Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the Hubble Space telescope. [...] "In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding <b>gas</b> <b>streams</b> from two stars so close together that they'd look like a point source to us. But what happens to <b>gas</b> <b>streams</b> that escape to farther distances? The extended hot stuff {{in the middle of}} the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} {{advances}} in zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), that have {{allowed them to}} be useful for carbon dioxide separation from flue <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> Extensive modeling has been performed to demonstrate the value of using MOFs as membranes. MOF materials are adsorption-based, and thus can be tuned to achieve selectivity. The drawback to MOF systems is stability in water and other compounds present in flue <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> Select materials, such as ZIF-8, have demonstrated stability in water and benzene, contents often present in flue gas mixtures.
