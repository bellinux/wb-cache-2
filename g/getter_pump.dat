40|$|The vacuum {{required}} for electron machines {{is determined by}} the beam lifetime and must be in the ultrahigh vacuum range. Since the emission of intense synchrotron radiation by the electron beam produces strong dynamic outgassing from the vacuum chamber, this gas load must be removed by a powerful, distributed pumping system. To achieve good beam lifetimes an extended in-situ cleaning (beam conditioning) by synchrotron radiation must be applied. High pumping speeds can be obtained using a distributed pumping system, e. g. based on linear, non-evaporable <b>getter</b> <b>pumps.</b> The absorption of the synchrotron radiation power, either by the vacuum chamber directly or on local aborbers,is closely linked to the design of the global system and to the choice of the vacuum chamber material...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{summarized}} {{for an investigation}} of the sorption rates of gases on vapor-deposited titanium films. The usefulness of such films for ultrahigh speed vacuum pumping is appraised. The sorption of hydrogen, deuterium, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor, helium, argon, and methane onto titanium films was measured for a variety of circumstances using techniques and apparatus developed for this specific purpose. The information obtained and techniques evolved in this study have shown that large-scale <b>getter</b> <b>pumping</b> is feasible and can be a very effective means of pumping many gases. Sticking fractions larger than 0. 8 were obtained for hydrogen, deuterium, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The experiments have shown that the sticking fraction for gases on vapor-deposited films {{is a function of the}} deposition conditions. There is strong evidence to support the supposition that conditions which favor the formation of a porous, fine-grained film structure with a large surface-to-volume ratio produce films with the highest sorption rates. The technique for measuring sticking fractions is new and in many respects unique. It utilizes a very large sorption surface, thus minimizing the perturbing effect of the instrumentation and evaporation apparatus and reducing the hazard of film contamination due to small leaks in the system or outgassing of system components. The method gives especially good accuracy for measurements of sticking fractions approaching unity. The quantity of gas adsorbed, the gas flux onto the getter surface, and the gas flux leaving the getter surface are measured directly. Any two of these three independent measurements can be used to determine the sticking fraction, thereby providing a means of checking the data. The evaporation techniques, substrate surface, and substrate area were chosen to very nearly duplicate the conditions likely to be encountered in the practical application of large-scale <b>getter</b> <b>pumping.</b> (auth...|$|R
40|$|A method {{eliminates}} (or recovers from) residual methane {{buildup in}} getter-pumped atomic frequency standard systems by applying ionizing assistance. Ultra-high stability trapped ion frequency standards for applications requiring very high reliability, and/or low power and mass (both for ground-based and space-based platforms) benefit from using sealed vacuum systems. These systems require careful material selection and system processing (cleaning and high-temperature bake-out). Even {{under the most}} careful preparation, residual hydrogen outgassing from vacuum chamber walls typically limits the base pressure. Non-evaporable <b>getter</b> <b>pumps</b> (NEGs) provide a convenient pumping option for sealed systems because of low mass and volume, and no power once activated.

40|$|The {{structure}} of LEP, with long bending magnets and little {{access to the}} vacuum chamber between them, required distributed pumping. This is an early prototype for the LEP vacuum chamber, made from extruded aluminium. The main opening is for the beam. The small channel to the right is for cooling water, to carry away the heat deposited by the synchroton radiation from the beam. The 4 slots in the channel to the left house the strip-shaped ion-getter pumps (see 7810255). The ion-getter pumps depended on the magnetic field of the bending magnets, too low at injection energy for the pumps to function well. Also, a different design was required outside the bending magnets. This design was therefore abandoned, in favour of a thermal <b>getter</b> <b>pump</b> (see 8301153 and 8305170) ...|$|E

40|$|Many accelerators of {{electron}} beams {{are susceptible}} to per-sistent beam lifetime disruptions, with correspondingly re-duced performance. One distinguishes between three pre-vailing explanations of these disruptions: (1) trapping of positive atomic ions in the negatively charged beam; (2) trapping of small highly positively ionised micro-objects (“dust”) in the negatively charged beam; (3) disruptions due to stray magnetic objects trapped in the magnetic field of undulators. The lifetime disruption of certain electron storage rings that employ ion-getter pump systems are attributed by most researchers to explanation (2), the trapped dust hypothe-sis. Systematic experimental studies of HERA, PETRA and DORIS reinforce the suspicion that specifically this type of pump system is the culprit. Examples of beam lifetime disruptions are presented, to-gether with a summary of observations and experiments performed at various afflicted storage rings to investigate dust trapping and the connection between ion <b>getter</b> <b>pumps</b> and dust particle release.

With this architecture we have demonstrated short-term stability approx. 1 - 2 x 10 -(sup 1) (sup 3) at 1 second, averaging to 10 -(sup 1) ? at 1 day. This development shows that H-maser quality stabilities can be produced in a small clock package, comparable in size to an ultra-stable quartz oscillator required for holding 1 - 2 x 10 -(sup 1) (sup 3) at 1 second.

Lett. 102, 234103 (2013) ]. This demonstration was achieved by addressing two discharge problems that lead to vacuum breakdown in the dc gun. One is field emission generated from a central stem electrode. We employed a segmented insulator to protect the ceramic insulator surface from the field emission. The other is microdischarge at an anode electrode or a vacuum chamber, which is triggered by microparticle transfer or field emission from a cathode electrode. An experimental investigation revealed that a larger acceleration gap, optimized mainly to reduce the surface electric field of the anode electrode, suppresses the microdischarge events that accompany gas desorption.
