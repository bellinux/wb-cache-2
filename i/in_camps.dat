5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian {{immigration}} into Israel first emerged {{among the}} Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, living <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians {{crossing the border}} seeking food or the recovery of property lost in the 1948 war.|$|E
25|$|Historians Ramsay Weston Phipps and Edward Cust both {{assert that}} Saint-André led the allies at Saorgio. However, {{an order of}} battle exists for the Austro-Sardinian army on 8 June 1793 that placed the Duke of Chablais in command over the Left Division of Saint-André and the Right Division of Colli. The Left Division had two {{battalion}}s of Infantry Regiment Nice, one battalion of Queen's and 8th Grenadier Battalion <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Brouis, two battalions of Saluzzo <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Perus, two battalions of Tortona in Saorge, two battalions of Vercelli <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Linieras, one battalion of Sardinia <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Albarea, 1st Light Battalion <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Beolet, one battalion of Queen's <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Briel and 4th Grenadier Battalion <b>in</b> <b>Camp</b> Corgoule.

Her time <b>in</b> <b>camp</b> left a lasting imprint on her writings. Much of the original haiku that were written during her years <b>in</b> the <b>camps</b> has been lost or destroyed, however, her surviving writings and later work reflected the desolation and despair that she felt during that period.|$|R

5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|Conditions <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> varied {{considerably}} geographically {{and over}} time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E
5|$|German forces invaded Belgium, {{which had}} been {{following}} a policy of neutrality, on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, Belgium surrendered on 28 May and was placed under German occupation. During the fighting, between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20 percent of the country's entire male population) served in the military. Many were made prisoners of war and detained <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> in Germany, although some were released {{before the end of}} the war. Leopold III, king and commander-in-chief of the army, also surrendered to the Germans on 28 May along with his army and was also held as prisoner by the Germans. The Belgian government fled first to Bordeaux in France, and then to London where it formed a government in exile.|$|E

5|$|More than 21,000 {{members of}} the AIF were {{captured}} by the Japanese during {{the first months of}} 1942. Most of these men were {{members of the}} 8th Division captured at Singapore, the NEI and Rabaul, but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there. Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly, resulting in a high death rate. Australians were held <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships. While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease, hundreds were murdered by their guards. The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences, as 13,000Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese; nearly 2,650Australians died there. Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions. The POWs held <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates; 77percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945. Overall, only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity. The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease. The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war. Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country's zone of responsibility after the war, and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland began on 17 September {{in accordance with}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Red Army advanced quickly and met little resistance, as Polish forces facing them were under orders not to engage the Soviets. About 250,000 to 454,700 Polish soldiers and policemen were captured and interned by the Soviet authorities. Some were freed or escaped quickly, but 125,000 were imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> run by the NKVD. Of these, 42,400 soldiers, mostly of Ukrainian and White Russian ethnicity serving in the Polish army, who lived in the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, were released in October. The 43,000 soldiers born in western Poland, then under German control, were transferred to the Germans; in turn, the Soviets received 13,575 Polish prisoners from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav People's Army took {{thousands}} of prisoners {{during the war}} in Croatia, and interned them <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. The Croatian forces also captured some Serbian prisoners, and the two sides agreed to several prisoner exchanges; most prisoners were freed by the end of 1992. Some infamous prisons included the Sremska Mitrovica camp, the Stajićevo camp, and the Begejci camp in Serbia, and the Morinj camp in Montenegro. The Croatian Army also established detention camps, such as the Lora prison camp in Split.|$|E

5|$|The white lion {{is not a}} {{distinct}} subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin {{to that of the}} white tiger; the condition is similar to melanism, which causes dark skin. They are not albinos, but have normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lion individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is caused by a recessive allele. Reportedly, they have been bred <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live <b>in</b> <b>camps.</b> The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Within Stalags and Oflags, prisoners had {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} leisure time. Letters and parcels from home could take months to arrive <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> and be distributed by the Red Cross; consequently, most had little regular contact with their families. The Red Cross also provided food, books, sports equipment and musical instruments, {{as well as information}} and letters. Thanks to the access to books, the historian Fernand Braudel wrote most of his influential work La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II (1949), which established the analytical concept of the longue durée, while in captivity in Germany.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly <b>in</b> <b>camps,</b> and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside <b>in</b> <b>camps.</b> Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} mainly used {{horses for}} logistical support; {{they were better}} than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation <b>in</b> <b>camps,</b> caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops {{were told that the}} loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short of horses.|$|E

5|$|In Bačka and Baranja, the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian {{authorities}} killed {{significant numbers}} of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Bačka and Baranja {{in the second half}} of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, Pechuj and Baja. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months, with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.|$|E
