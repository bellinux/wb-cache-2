25|$|Joe Paterno {{expressed}} his displeasure with the officials {{for the second}} time this season as he yelled at referee David Witvoet after regulation. There were a number of odd and questionable actions by the officials during the game, as pointed out by the TV commentators, including the roughing the punter penalty and the referee refusing to ask for measurements when it appeared Michigan had been stopped short of first down. Each time <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sideline and signaled first down. It was most noticeable in the third quarter when he signaled first down even as Michigan was lining up in short-yardage formation, thinking it was third-and-1.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrick {{smiled as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> major’s severe countenance.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{neat little}} bill {{and took out}} his pocketbook.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifthly and lastly," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tube. [...] "Say, young fellah, don't tell me you've been writin' up your {{impressions}} in {{that paper}} on your knee." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Oh, it's all right, Mr. McIlheny. You've {{only got}} {{about half a}} minute." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock, and McIlheny runs out, profusely waving his hand in adieu.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> behind <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{retreating}} {{figure of}} the flower woman.|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} with some letters. Relocking the door, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> envelopes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> watch {{which he}} had taken from his {{waistcoat}} pocket.|$|E
60|$|Aaron frowned {{slightly}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark, self-possessed {{face of the}} little man.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{little man}} with the peeled nose.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it steadfastly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> covertly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young man, who {{was already}} {{immersed}} in his work.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steep face {{of broken}} rock that ran {{down into the}} shadow.|$|E
60|$|Helen showed it. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> initials, {{and laid}} it down with a slight smile.|$|E
60|$|And then, from habit, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{clock in}} the tower, and made further oration.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a noble spire,' said <b>he,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great stone spire {{in front}} of us. 'The men of old {{would seem to have}} spent all their days in piling stones upon stones. And yet we read of tough battles and shrewd blows struck, showing that they had some time for soldierly relaxation, and were not always at this mason work.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it with folded arms.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{clock in}} the tower. <b>The</b> hands stood <b>at</b> three minutes to nine.|$|R
60|$|When a pause came, Billy stood up, {{still holding}} her. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fried potatoes.|$|E
60|$|Somewhat irrelevantly <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{next few}} boxes where {{the rest of}} Mrs. Montressor's guests were.|$|E
60|$|Richard {{needed no}} further urging. Whatever Mattie said must {{certainly}} be right. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock.|$|E
60|$|Tallente {{affected}} to misunderstand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> around <b>at</b> <b>the</b> few farmhouses dotted in sheltered places {{amongst the}} hills.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{business}} of Samuel Weatherley & Company," [...] <b>he</b> interrupted, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock, [...] "will be entirely disorganized unless you promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|Baldassarre did {{not reply}} immediately; <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> suspiciously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> officious stranger. <b>At</b> last he said, [...] "If you will." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> book, and {{the bit of}} sky was crimson. But {{still he}} said nothing.|$|E
60|$|John {{took up his}} hat and gloves. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock--it was {{a little}} past eleven.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{frowned at}} me. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young lady as though seeking for some explanation.|$|E
50|$|The {{occupants}} are humanoid—a man and {{an adolescent}} boy—standing immobile and apparently lifeless. Carter, thinking he sees movement within the cabinet, tries to brush away dust {{for a better}} look. Before his hand touches the glass, he is thrown back by a powerful force-field. As Johnson kneels to check on Carter, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> aliens—and is shocked to see the adult's eyes are open, glaring {{at him with a}} burning intensity.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> disdainfully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{smooth face}} and careful dress of their visitor, who bore the {{inspection}} with a kindly return of contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seventy-five cents I am offered!" [...] cried Matt. [...] "Who {{makes it}} a dollar--ninety--eight-five--eighty?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> inquiringly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old countryman.|$|R
60|$|The doctor's eyes sparkled as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gold {{which his}} visitor had laid upon the table.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Captain Putnam had come in. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead snake {{and gave a}} start.|$|E
60|$|Granet was {{thoughtful}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little {{clock on}} the dashboard opposite to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fools of Habit," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cover. [...] "I see it {{is making}} quite a {{sensation}} down east. I suppose you've read it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are you off to, Jernyngham?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{rolled up}} blanket. [...] "Looks {{as if you}} meant to camp on the trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's not in dock, sir," [...] he said. [...] "She's lying out yonder. You'll barely catch her, I'm afraid," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock.|$|R
