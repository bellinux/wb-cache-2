500|$|Zrinski did {{not allow}} the final assault {{to break into the}} castle. [...] As the Turks were {{pressing}} forwards along a narrow bridge the defenders suddenly <b>flung</b> <b>open</b> the gate and fired a large mortar loaded with broken iron, killing 600 attackers. Zrinski then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle. He received two musket wounds in his chest and was killed shortly afterwards by an arrow to the head.

500|$|... "As David grapples {{with the}} fire {{extinguisher}} to remove the hose from the barrel, we hear running footsteps approaching. The door is suddenly <b>flung</b> <b>open</b> and two male colleagues of the counsellor's burst open into the room. In a second they {{take a look at}} the scene, and we see what they see—the counsellor looking lost, Karen looking shocked, and most significantly, David standing over the counsellor, brandishing a fire extinguisher in an apparently threatening manner. Presuming their colleague to be in danger, the two men hurl themselves at David, knocking him to the ground. He squeals as he goes down, and complains loudly as he's pinned to the floor." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Alice de Janzé's {{life was}} {{prominently}} {{featured in the}} investigative non-fiction book White Mischief by journalist James Fox, which examined the events surrounding the murder of Lord Erroll, the Happy Valley set, and their notorious life {{before and after the}} event. [...] In 1988, the book was made into an eponymous film, directed by Michael Radford, in which Alice de Janzé was portrayed by British actress Sarah Miles. Radford was reportedly drawn to the story primarily due to an incident attributed to Alice, in which she had once <b>flung</b> <b>open</b> the shutters of her window in her house in Kenya and remarked: [...] "Oh, God. Not another fucking beautiful day." [...] Radford incorporated this scene into the film.|$|E
