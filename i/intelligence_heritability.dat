50|$|Heritability {{measures}} {{the fraction of}} phenotype variability that {{can be attributed to}} genetic variation. This {{is not the same as}} saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics. In addition, heritability can change without any genetic change occurring, such as when the environment starts contributing to more variation. As a case in point, consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence <b>intelligence.</b> <b>Heritability</b> could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation, like showing different levels of intelligence. On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation, like showing more similar levels of <b>intelligence.</b> <b>Heritability</b> increases when genetics are contributing more variation or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation; what matters is the relative contribution. Heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{influence}} on the association between contemporaneously measured intelligence and academic achievement in childhood was examined in nationally representative cohorts from England and The Netherlands using a whole population indirect twin design, including singleton data. We identified 1, 056 same-sex (SS) and 495 opposite-sex (OS) twin pairs among 174, 098 British 11 year-olds with test scores from 2004, and, 785 SS and 327 OS twin pairs among 120, 995 Dutch schoolchildren, aged 8, 10 or 12 years, with assessments from 1994 to 2002. The estimate of <b>intelligence</b> <b>heritability</b> was large in both cohorts, consistent with previous studies (h (2) = 0. 70 +/- A 0. 14, England; h (2) = 0. 43 +/- A 0. 28 - 0. 67 +/- A 0. 31, The Netherlands), as was the heritability of academic achievement variables (h (2) = 0. 51 +/- A 0. 16 - 0. 81 +/- A 0. 16, England; h (2) = 0. 36 +/- A 0. 27 - 0. 74 +/- A 0. 27, The Netherlands). Additive genetic covariance explained {{the large majority of}} the phenotypic correlations between intelligence and academic achievement scores in England, when standardised to a bivariate heritability (Biv h (2) = 0. 76 +/- A 0. 15 - 0. 88 +/- A 0. 16), and less consistent but often large proportions of the phenotypic correlations in The Netherlands (Biv h (2) = 0. 33 +/- A 0. 52 - 1. 00 +/- A 0. 43). In the British cohort both nonverbal and verbal reasoning showed very high additive genetic covariance with achievement scores (Biv h (2) = 0. 94 - 0. 98; Biv h (2) = 0. 77 - 1. 00 respectively). In The Netherlands, covariance estimates were consistent across age groups. The heritability of intelligence-academic achievement associations in two population cohorts of elementary schoolchildren, using a twin pair extraction method, is at the high end of estimates reported by studies of largely preselected twin samples...|$|E
50|$|Hogben's {{research}} {{has left a}} lasting impression {{on the history of}} biology. The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), which Hogben first developed as a model organism, {{is now one of the}} most widely used model organisms in biological research. Likewise, his emphasis on the interdependence of nature and nurture has affected and continues to affect scientific practice and scientific debate. In terms of scientific practice, modern research on phenotypic plasticity, gene-environment interaction, and developmental systems theory all owes much to the legacy of Hogben's initial emphasis on understanding nature and nurture interdependently rather than in dichotomy. In terms of scientific debate, the dispute between Hogben and R.A. Fisher over gene-environment interaction was the first of many subsequent disputes over the extent to which the primacy of the gene can be understood independently of its developmental relationship with the environment (Tabery 2007). The debate on nature and nurture, the race and <b>intelligence</b> controversy, the <b>heritability</b> wars, concerns over the geneticisation of complex human traits, and arguments over the promises and perils of the human genome project all incorporate some element of disagreement over the primacy of the gene. Hogben's attack on that primacy by appeal to the interdependence of nature and nurture has been echoed in each successive dispute.|$|R
5000|$|Snyderman and Rothman {{originally}} conducted their {{survey in}} 1984 {{because they felt}} that intelligence testing had been portrayed in the media as being in direct opposition to egalitarianism. They described the IQ controversy in terms of two conflicting sets of values in the US: egalitarianism, favouring equal opportunity, and meritocracy, favouring individual differences. In the 1960s, {{in the light of}} the civil rights movement, an environmental view of <b>intelligence</b> differences, de-emphasizing <b>heritability,</b> had become prevalent. In their view equality of opportunity had been transformed to mean equality of outcome, to the detriment of more able individuals. As they wrote: The danger inherent in egalitarianism is that a philosophy of human rights may be extrapolated into a theory of human nature. That individuals should be treated equally does not mean that all individuals are equal. Whether as a result of accidents of birth and environment, or through strength of will, people differ in abilities of all sorts. As a consequence, they wrote that attitudes to intelligence testing had changed: Intelligence and aptitude tests have fallen into disfavor among the literate public, as have attempts to define intelligence. However intelligence is defined, the suggestion that individual differences in intelligence, like individual capacities for painting or composing, may have a genetic component has become anathema. Snyderman and Rothman claimed that the media had misrepresented the views of experts, so that the public now believed that it was impossible to define intelligence, that IQ or aptitude tests were outmoded and that environmentalism and hereditarianism were incompatible points of view. As they wrote: [...] Most significantly, the literate and informed public today is persuaded that the majority of experts in the field believe it is impossible to adequately define intelligence, that intelligence tests do not measure anything that is relevant to life performance... It appears from book reviews in popular journals and from newspaper and television coverage of IQ issues that such are the views of the vast majority of experts who study questions of intelligence and intelligence testing. The purpose of their survey was to challenge what they considered to be the media's portrayal of intelligence testing. Their study had three parts: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of general cognitive ability (g) {{on the performance}} {{of a wide variety of}} cognitive abilities is well established. The primacy of genetic influences on g (genetic g) also has firm empirical standing. This thesis aimed to investigate the {{influence of}} genetic g on a range of measures that had either not been previously investigated or had been indexed in different ways from those used here. In five empirical studies, I investigated: (1) word reading ability, (2) general academic achievement, (3) specific academic achievement skills, (4) chromosomal regions implicated in variation in academic achievement, and (5) the personality construct of Openness to Experience (Openness). Based on previous findings and accompanying theory it was hypothesised that genetic g would exert significant and substantive influence on irregular word reading ability, general academic achievement and specific academic achievement skills, and three particular facets of Openness known collectively as Objective Openness. It was also hypothesised that chromosomal regions reported as pertinent to variation in IQ would be germane to variation in academic achievement. For study 1, data were available from 500 (225 MZ, 275 DZ) twin pairs (mean age, 16 years). Two tests of reading words aloud were employed: the Cambridge Contextual Reading Test (CCRT) which measures irregular word reading skills and the Schonell Graded Word Reading Test (SGWRT) which incorporates both irregular and regular words. IQ subtests were drawn from the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB) and the Wechsler Adult <b>Intelligence</b> Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). <b>Heritabilities</b> of 0. 54 and 0. 65 were obtained for the CCRT and SGWRT respectively. Heritabilities for IQ subtests ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 65. A genetic general factor accounted for 13 % of the variance in the CCRT and 20 % of the variance in the SGWRT. Genetic influences of comparable magnitude were found for a genetic reading factor and a genetic verbal factor. The best fitting model suggested that genetic influences were principally responsible for the phenotypic correlation between IQ subtests and word reading, and that approximately a third of this influence was due to genetic g. For study 2, IQ data from 582 (256 MZ, 326 DZ) twin pairs (mean age, 17 years for IQ, 16 years for academic achievement) were analysed. Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ) were measured using the MAB and general academic achievement was measured using total score for the Queensland Core Skills Test (QCST). A trivariate Cholseky decomposition was used to examine genetic and environmental influences. Heritability of the QCST was estimated at 0. 72 incorporating adjustment for truncate selection (upward bias) and assortative mating (downward bias). Common environmental influences were minor, as were unique environmental effects. Strikingly, there was no significant specific genetic influence on the QCST, indicating that genetic g sufficiently explains all genetic variation in total academic achievement on the QCST. For study 3, QCST data from 390 twin pairs (182 MZ, 208 DZ) and IQ data from 611 (VIQ) to 615 (Pairs) were used. IQ data were primarily included to adjust for truncate selection. The influence of genetic g on five specific academic skills which constitute the QCST was examined. Heritabilities of the specific academic skills ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 73 with limited common environmental influences being evident. Unique environmental influences were essentially specific to each measure. Genetic g accounted for all genetic variation in three of the five academic skills and approximately 90 % of genetic variation in the two other academic skills: essay writing and mathematical problem solving. About 32 % to 73 % of phenotypic variation in specific academic skills was attributable to genetic g. It was concluded that genetic g is of primary importance in variation in specific academic achievement skills as measured by the QCST. For study 4, data from 210 families were analysed in a linkage analysis designed to locate chromosomal regions potentially implicated in variation in academic achievement. Data were analysed using Merlin-Regress to permit adjustment due to truncate selection. While no empirically derived significant or suggestive linkage peaks were observed for total QCST score, linkage was observed for a number of regions recently suggested to be involved in variation in IQ measures. Consistent with recent findings, linkage on chromosome 2 (LOD = 1. 26) and chromosome 18 (LOD = 1. 25) were observed for PIQ and FSIQ on chromosome 2 and dyslexia on chromosome 18. While empirically suggestive LOD scores for a number of specific academic skills were observed in other chromosomal regions the results were not considered sufficiently robust to warrant firm conclusions. For study 5, data from 754 families were analysed with the aim of investigating the genetic and environmental bases of the relationships among cognitive measures of Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), educational achievement (QCST), 2 -Choice Reaction Time (CRT), and inspection time (IT), and Openness facets from the NEO-Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PIR). The number of twin and twin/sibling pairs ranged from 432 (182 MZ, 350 DZ/sibling) to 1023 (273 MZ, 750 DZ/sibling) for cognitive measures, and between 432 (90 MZ, 342 DZ/siblings)  437 (91 MZ, 346 DZ/siblings) for Openness facets. The strongest phenotypic correlations between Openness and cognitive measures were between Ideas and the QCST (0. 42) and Values and the QCST (0. 32). Openness facets tended to correlate more strongly with verbal measures. However, Values and Ideas accounted for 3 % and 8 % respectively of variation in PIQ. Genetic g was shown to exert influence over five of the Openness facets (not Actions) as well as IQ and processing speed measures. The strongest influences from genetic g on Openness measures were for Ideas and Values with loadings of 0. 51 and 0. 38 respectively, thus accounting for 26 % and 14 % of their respective variances. The best fitting model was interpreted as suggesting that higher levels of general cognitive ability engender a small, albeit discernible tendency toward several facets of Openness. Overall, the five studies showed the primacy of the influence of genetic g on cognitive measures of academic achievement and word reading. Beyond exhibiting a genetic correlation between academic achievement and IQ, the linkage analysis provided evidence that the genetic correlation is due to pleiotropic genetic effects arising principally from regions on chromosome 2. The breadth of influence of genetic g was illustrated with its demonstrable effect on Openness personality variables, particularly the pursuit of a manifold array of cultural and intellectual interests (Ideas), and questioning of conventional norms and receptivity to unconventional values (Values) ...|$|R
