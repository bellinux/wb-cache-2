In conventional practice one factorizes the groundstate wave functions |Ψ) = e S |Φ) which {{live in the}} “physical” Hilbert space H (P) using an elementary ansatz for |Φi plus a formal expansion of S in an operator basis of multi-configurational creation operators C +. In our paper a reinterpretation of the method is proposed. Using parallels between the CCM and the so called quasi-Hermitian, alias three-Hilbert-space (THS), quantum mechanics, the CCM transition from the known microscopic Hamiltonian (denoted by usual symbol H), which is self-adjoint in H (P), to its effective lower-case isospectral avatar h = e −S <b>He</b> <b>S,</b> <b>is</b> assigned a THS interpretation. In the opposite direction, a THS-prescribed, non-CCM, innovative reinstallation of Hermiticity is shown to be possible for the CCM effective Hamiltonian h, which only appears manifestly non-Hermitian in its own (“friendly”) Hilbert space H (F). This goal is achieved via an ad hoc amendment of the inner product in H (F), thereby yielding the third (“standard”) Hilbert space H (S). Due to the resulting exact unitary equivalence {{between the first and}} third spaces, H (F) ∼ H (S), the indistinguishability of predictions calculated in these alternative physical frameworks is guaranteed...|$|R
