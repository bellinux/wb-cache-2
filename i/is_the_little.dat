5|$|Three {{defensive}} {{positions are}} positioned outside the main ramparts of the castle. To the south, reached by an underground passage, is the Half-Moon Battery, constructed in 1793 and redesigned in 1895 and 1941. This has two camouflaged gun houses and 6-inch guns {{dating from the}} Second World War, when it held a team of 99 soldiers. Further south, near the waterline, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Dennis Blockhouse, a D-shaped gun position dating from 1539, altered in the 1540s and then adapted to form {{part of a larger}} fortification covering the whole of Pendennis Point in the late 16th century. Built from Killas rubble, the exterior of the blockhouse and its lookout turret still survive intact. Just along the shoreline to the north-east is the Crab Quay Battery, a set of defences originating in the 16th century, intended to prevent an amphibious landing on the headland, and modernised extensively in 1902.|$|E

25|$|The core text of a Book of Hours <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Office of the Virgin, {{illustrated}} by {{scenes from the}} Life of the Virgin. This series of hourly prayers were prayed to the Mother of God, who co-mediates and sanctifies the prayers to God. The Penitential Psalms were recited to help one resist temptation of committing any of the Seven Deadly Sins. The prayers in the Office of the Dead were prayed to shorten the time a loved one spent in Purgatory. Supplementary texts were added to celebrate any personal patron, family saint, special circumstances, or a fortuitous event. This standard pattern of daily prayer provided the framework for the artists' efforts.|$|E
25|$|Clonal {{derivation}} {{exists in}} nature in some animal species and {{is referred to}} as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, fish (for example the hammerhead shark), the Komodo dragon and lizards. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments.|$|E

25|$|Wolverhampton has {{a number}} of live music venues; the largest {{occasionally}} used being the football ground, Molineux Stadium, which was used for a Bon Jovi concert in 2003, but the biggest indoor venue regularly used is Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with a standing capacity of 3,000. Second to that is Wulfrun Hall (part of the same complex as the Civic Hall, which is owned and operated by the City Council) which has a standing capacity of just over 1,100. The Civic Halls complex also has a newer venue, The Slade Rooms (named after the 1970s rock band), which has a capacity of approximately 550 standing. There are also a number of smaller venues with capacities of between 100 and 250, although the longest-established of these, the Wolverhampton Varsity, is now closed, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Civic. Other venues include the Light Bar in Fryer Street, the 'Numa Bar' and the Dog & Doublet (next to the old Little Civic), although the situation in this area of entertainment remains fluid. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company, and Wolf Town DIY, an independent record label that primarily releases punk and alternative music by underground artists. The Midland Box Office is the primary sales point for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is manned by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.|$|E
500|$|In English language, German, Russian and Scandinavian historiography, these {{conflicts}} were traditionally {{referred to as}} First Northern War. The term [...] "Second Northern War", coined in Polish historiography (Druga Wojna Północna), has lately been increasingly adopted by German and English language historiography. Another ambiguous term referring to the Second Northern War <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Northern War, which however might also refer to the 1741-43 war. In Poland, the term [...] "The Deluge" [...] is also ambiguous, as it is sometimes used for a broader series of wars against Sweden, Brandenburg, Russia, Transylvania and the Cossacks.|$|E
500|$|Despite these criticisms, {{the novel}} still {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, [...] "So this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> lady who started this great war." [...] Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.|$|E

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, {{following}} the Bible. It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. In {{the first year after}} it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States; one million copies in Great Britain. In 1855, three years after it was published, it was called [...] "the most popular novel of our day."

500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{was clearly}} Stowe's magnum opus (although she {{considered}} Old Town Folks, {{which was written}} {{while she was in}} Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying [...] "So this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> lady who made this big war?" [...] Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it [...] "uneven in quality and unstable in stance". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it [...] "downright offensive" [...] and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.|$|E
