5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application {{was rejected by the}} CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium.

The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E

5|$|His mother {{raised the}} family, {{including}} Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time gang member with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling {{to keep him out}} of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance.

5|$|In 2003, the Insight Bowl {{contracted}} with the Big East conference and Pacific-10 conference to select teams <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> its annual game. Big East champion Miami was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth, and second-place Pittsburgh accepted {{a bid to}} the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech {{to participate in the}} game, but were required to invite Virginia due to the Continental Tire Bowl's contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference. Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season, Continental Bowl officials chose another team. The other possibility for the Hokies was the San Francisco Bowl, whose managers also held a contract with the Big East, but because Tech played in the previous year's San Francisco Bowl, the bowl's organizing committee decided against a second invitation.|$|E

MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in The New York Times by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials have denied such claims. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E

5|$|In Vaikom, a {{small town}} in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of {{untouchability}} in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On the fourteenth of April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned <b>for</b> <b>participation.</b> <b>In</b> spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.|$|E
