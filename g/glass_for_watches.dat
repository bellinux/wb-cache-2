30|$|Originally, {{anaglyph}} {{glasses with}} separate {{red and blue}} lenses were used to generate the stereoscopic 3 D effect for movies. When wearing the glasses, part of the 3 D image is displayed to the one eye {{and the second part}} to the other eye. The modern version of these glasses uses circular polarization. The objection to this technology is that the brightness of the image is essentially halved. Active shutter <b>glasses</b> are used <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> most 3 D televisions. The media is displayed at a high frame-rate, and the glasses rapidly switch between opaque and clear using a pair of low-latency transparent liquid-crystal displays. For auto-stereoscopic displays, the lenticular lens method (a saw-tooth prism) was used in the 1990 s for “holographic” displays on fancy jewel cases for compact discs. However, there is a relatively small “sweet spot,” and the effective resolution and brightness are halved. To overcome these drawbacks, the screens have to be modified.|$|R
