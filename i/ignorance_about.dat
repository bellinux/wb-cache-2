5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the consequences of radiation sickness, {{with much of the}} public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

5000|$|Avidya {{appears as}} a major item of {{discussion}} in two doctrines {{about the nature of}} reality, in various Buddhist traditions. One relates to the Anatta (Anatman) doctrine, that is <b>ignorance</b> or misconceptions <b>about</b> [...] "Self", when in reality there is only non-Self according to Buddhism. The second relates to Anicca doctrine, that is <b>ignorance</b> or misconceptions <b>about</b> [...] "permanence", when the nature of reality is impermanence.|$|R

25|$|According to Timothy S. George, the {{environmental}} protests {{that surrounded the}} disease appeared {{to aid in the}} democratization of Japan. When the first cases were reported and subsequently suppressed, the rights of the victims were not recognised, and they were given no compensation. Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the disease, as people were afraid that it was contagious.|$|E
25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the details of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mary Ann Bighead" [...] – {{a mockery}} of the former Times {{columnist}} and assistant editor Mary Ann Sieghart. Bighead is lampooned for her pretentions, <b>ignorance,</b> boastfulness <b>about</b> her children Brainella and Intelligencia, high standard of living, travels (mainly to developing countries where she patronises the locals), {{and the fact that she}} can speak so many languages (including Swahili, Tagalog and 13th Century Mongolian).|$|R

In 1987, he spoke against a proposal to re-institute {{the death penalty in}} Canada. Garnsworthy spoke in support of AIDS victims in 1987, saying that {{they have a right to}} pastoral care within the church community and expressing concern at [...] "fear and <b>ignorance</b> abroad <b>about</b> AIDS." ...|$|R
25|$|One {{should also}} keep {{the purpose of}} the {{analysis}} in mind when choosing the prior distribution. In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor can be misleading unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is carefully considered.|$|E
25|$|These {{transnational}} {{political and}} legal ramifications threw a veil of secrecy around the disaster and obstructed the discovery of vital medical and toxicologic information. The medical community was often frustrated in its attempts to understand the links between gas exposure and health and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> whether the main poison, methyl isocyanate, could decompose to deadly cyanide gas, led to years of acrimonious debate {{on the merits of}} treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Before Internet Explorer 6 SP2 was {{released}} {{as part of}} Windows XP Service Pack 2, the browser would automatically display an installation window for any ActiveX component that a website wanted to install. The combination of user <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> these changes, and the assumption by Internet Explorer that all ActiveX components are benign, helped to spread spyware significantly. Many spyware components would also make use of exploits in JavaScript, Internet Explorer and Windows to install without user knowledge or permission.|$|E

Asked to name the most important problem facing them, the options named by more than ten percent of American Muslims were discrimination (19%), being viewed as a terrorist (15%), public's <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> Islam (13%), and stereotyping (12%). 54% believe that the U.S. government's anti-terrorism activities single out Muslims. 76% of surveyed Muslim Americans stated that they are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, while 61% express a similar concern about the possibility of Islamic extremism in the United States.|$|E
25|$|By this time, all {{routes to}} the North were {{completely}} sealed so Heidsieck went to New Orleans {{and attempted to}} charter a boat to Mexico or Cuba in hopes of making it back to Europe. To facilitate his passage, the French consul in Mobile gave him a diplomatic pouch with a request to deliver some documents to the consulate in New Orleans. Arriving in New Orleans on 5 May 1862, {{he found that the}} city had fallen to Union forces and was immediately seized upon his arrival by General Benjamin F. Butler. Within the diplomatic pouch that was given to Heidsieck by the Mobile consulate were documents from French textile manufacturers about supplying the Confederate armies with their uniforms. Despite Heidsieck's pleas of innocence and <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the documents, he was charged with spying and imprisoned in Fort Jackson, Louisiana.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{favorable}} review upon release, stating [...] "Once again prime-time television entertainment is approaching {{the subject of}} AIDS through {{the case of a}} hemophiliac youth infected through a transfusion of tainted blood. The vast majority of AIDS patients are homosexuals and drug addicts, but television apparently is not ready to explore these groups with any degree of compassion. Innocent youngsters trapped by circumstances beyond their control provide far easier dramatic hooks for uplift exercises. Still, these stories are indeed heartbreaking and do serve as vehicles for exposing public <b>ignorance</b> and prejudice <b>about</b> AIDS. The Ryan White Story at 9 o'clock tonight on ABC is a good case in point. The key roles are more fleshed out and are handled remarkably well by Judith Light as Ryan's divorced, working mother, Nikki Cox as his kid sister Andrea, and Lukas Haas as Ryan. They hold the film together firmly as the unsettling story unfolds. It is a story not only <b>about</b> <b>ignorance</b> but also <b>about</b> an almost total lack of enlightened community leadership in the city of Kokomo. Residents are understandably concerned and frightened, but panic is allowed to take over. It is not a pretty story. Worse, it is a story that didn't have to happen. Ryan White's story is certainly worth telling." ...|$|R
5000|$|..... {{the notion}} that {{probabilistic}} theories must be about ensembles implicitly assumes that probability is <b>about</b> <b>ignorance.</b> (The 'hidden variables' are {{whatever it is that}} we are ignorant of.)

500|$|In the 1996 novel The Story of B, {{environmentalist}} author Daniel Quinn {{spends a}} chapter on {{the metaphor of the}} boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus. [...] Pierce Brosnan's character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie Dante's Peak in reference to the accumulating warning signs of the volcano's reawakening. Al Gore used a version of the story in a New York Times op ed, in his presentations and the 2006 movie An Inconvenient Truth to describe <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> global warming. In the movie version the frog is rescued before it is harmed. This use of the story was referenced ironically by writer/director Jon Cooksey in the title of his 2010 comedic documentary How to Boil a Frog.|$|E
500|$|In The Globe and Mail, Canadian author Paul William Roberts {{praised the}} book, calling it [...] "... the most {{important}} use of printed word and post-consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." [...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, {{not just because of}} the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." [...] Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, [...] "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> markets and economics." ...|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, several {{relatives}} of people killed during The Troubles {{objected to the}} prospect of a former IRA member, McGuinness, becoming President. On 10 October, McGuinness was confronted in Athlone by the son of a member of the Irish Army killed by the IRA after Don Tidey's kidnap in Ballinamore in 1983. [...] In a RTÉ interview that aired on 20 October, Bryan Dobson noted a 1985 Hot Press interview in which McGuinness indicated that he considered the IRA volunteers at Ballinamore to be [...] "defending themselves against armed Gardaí and soldiers." [...] When Dobson then asked if it was [...] "fair to say that on this occasion you were standing over the killing of members of the Gardaí and Defence Forces?" [...] McGuinness insisted that he has [...] "never done that." [...] The family of Garda Detective Frank Hand, killed in 1984, accused McGuinness of misleading younger generations with a [...] "glossy campaign". The husband of a mother killed by the IRA in 1981 said he doubted McGuinness' claims of <b>ignorance</b> <b>about</b> the identities of IRA killers, saying [...] "If anybody knows who did it, he does.

5000|$|Perfect {{redemption}} is the cognition {{itself of}} the ineffable greatness: for since through <b>ignorance</b> came <b>about</b> the defect ... {{the whole system}} springing from ignorance is dissolved in gnosis.

Through gnosis, then, is redeemed the inner, spiritual man: so that to us suffices the gnosis of universal being: and this is the true redemption.|$|R
