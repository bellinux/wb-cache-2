40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating system for an effective credit {{risk management system}} can not be overemphasized. The system demands contunuous support and involement of top management of the commercial banks, and the regulators. The attempt to develop robust <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating systems is ongoing among commercial banks. This study was made to measure the quality of <b>internal</b> credit <b>risk</b> rating systems of commercial banks in Pakistan {{in terms of the}} various aspects of an internal rating system. To achieve this objective interviews of head of risk management of 10 commercial banks operating in Pakistan were conducted. The unstructured questions used in the interviews were transcribed and the technique of content analysis was used. The findings revealed that <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating systems of commercial banks in Pakistan are generally strong but need improvement in a few aspects. The following areas of <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating systems of commercial banks in Pakistan were found weak: 1. 	Environment specific to <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating methodologies employed by the banks. 2. 	Environment specific to the documentation in the <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating system. Other areas such as credit grades, use of qualitative and quantitative factors, methodology, <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating <b>policy,</b> external credit rating, rating definitions, rating criteria, boards involvement were found in lines with the <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> rating guidelines issued by the SBP.

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that in order}} to combat climate change, GHG emissions need to be managed from the supply chain perspective. This paper moves one more step forward on the base of literature by introducing one concept—supply chain emission trading and one framework in addressing emission trading in the context of supply chains. To implement the supply chain emission trading, this paper proposed to assign the responsibility of supply chain GHG emissions to the focal company in the supply chain by including the scope 3 emissions of the focal company into ETS. Moreover, this paper discerns itself from others by identifying risks for supply chains under emission trading program. From a corporate perspective, these <b>risks</b> are from <b>policy</b> instability, market variation, supply chain agreement dispute, green investment uncertainty, and supply chain GHG emission accounting failure. Moreover, based on the concept of supply chain risks, this paper attributes green investment <b>risks</b> to <b>internal</b> and external <b>risks,</b> <b>policy</b> and market <b>risks</b> to supply chain environmental risks, accounting <b>risks</b> to <b>internal</b> <b>risks,</b> and agreement risks to external risks.|$|R

After a short overview about financial regulation in Germany in general, the paper {{focuses on the}} most important development in the area of capital adequacy regulation from the 1930 s up to the financial crisis. Two main trends are identified: a gradual softening of the eligibility criteria for regulatory equity and the increasing reliance on banks' <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> models for the determination of risk weights. The first trend has been reversed with the regulatory reforms following the financial crisis. <b>Internal</b> <b>risk</b> models will still play a central role. The rest of the paper focuses on the problems with the use of <b>internal</b> <b>risk</b> models for regulatory purposes. The discussion includes the moral hazard problem, the technical problems with the models, the difference between economically and socially optimal capital requirements, the pro-cyclicality of the models and the problem occurring due to the existence of fundamental uncertainty. The regulatory reforms due to Basel 2. 5 and Basel III and their potential to alleviate the identified problems are then examined. It is concluded that those cannot solve the most relevant problems and that currently the use of models for financial regulation is problematic. Finally, some suggestions of how the problems could be addressed are given...|$|R
