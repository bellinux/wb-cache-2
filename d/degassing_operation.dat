After some improvement, upgrade and tuning, the storage current of the HiSOR {{was up to}} 200 mA in May 2000. As the stored current increased more and vacuum degree was better by repeating <b>degassing</b> <b>operation,</b> the beam instability problem at injection and at acceleration was severer. At present, changing the operation point at injection and updating the tracking pattern at acceleration from 150 MeV to 700 MeV is only a way to suppress the beam instability of the HiSOR. In near future, we will get approval from the radiation protection authority for the operation with 350 mA. Then we are getting ready for upgrade of the HiSOR in order to operate stably. ...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{removal of}} {{unwanted}} particles from a molten metal alloy by flotation relies on purging a gas into the melt through a rotating impeller. This device is {{commonly known as}} a rotary degasser. Unwanted particles in the melt attach to the rising gas bubbles and rise to the slag layer where they are removed from the metal bulk. In addition, the turbulence created by the rotating impeller causes the randomly distributed solid particles to agglomerate into relatively large clusters. These clusters float up or settle down due to the difference between their density and that of the melt. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the particle dynamics and particle agglomeration that occur during the rotary degassing of aluminum melts. While previous investigations addressed particle collisions in low intensity turbulent fields where the size of the colliding particles is smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale, this model is more encompassing as it considers both low intensity and high intensity turbulence. Consequently, this model is more representative of a typical industrial rotary <b>degassing</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} is {{described}} an original dynamic model of a reactive co-rotating twinscrew extrusion (TSE) process operated by the Rhodia company for the Nylon- 66 degassing finishing step. In order to validate the model, dynamic experiments have been performed on a small-scale pilot plant. These experiments consist in a temporary injection of glass fibers at the inlet of the extruder after it has reached a given operating point. The outlet glass fibers mass fraction time variation is then measured. This experiment {{does not lead to}} the RTD measurement. As a matter of fact, due to the high quantity of glass fibers that is introduced, the behavior of the flow through the extruder is perturbed so that the glass fibers cannot be considered as an inert tracer. The dynamic model that we have published elsewhere (Choulak et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2004, 43 (23), 7373 - 7382) is adapted to take into account this nonlinear behavior of the extruder with respect to the glass fibers injection and is favorably compared to experimental results. The description of the <b>degassing</b> <b>operation</b> is also included in the model. The model allows simulations of the complete dynamic behavior of the process. When the steady state is reached, the good position of the degassing vent with respect to the partially and fully filled zones positions can also be checked, thus illustrating the way the model can be used for design purposes...|$|E

40|$|Oil caverns at the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) are {{subjected}} to geothermal heating from the surrounding domal salt. This process raises {{the temperature of the}} crude oil from around 75 F upon delivery to SPR to as high as 130 F after decades of storage. While this temperature regime is adequate for long-term storage, it poses challenges for offsite delivery, with warm oil evolving gases that pose handling and safety problems. SPR installed high-capacity oil coolers in the mid- 1990 's to mitigate the emissions problem by lowering the oil delivery temperature. These heat exchanger units use incoming raw water as the cooling fluid, and operate only during a drawdown event where incoming water displaces the outgoing oil. The design criteria for the heat exchangers are to deliver oil at 100 F or less under all drawdown conditions. Increasing crude oil vapor pressures due in part to methane intrusion in the caverns is threatening to produce sufficient emissions at or near 100 F to cause the cooled oil to violate delivery requirements. This impending problem has initiated discussion and analysis of alternative cooling methods to bring the oil temperature even lower than the original design basis of 100 F. For the study described in this report, two alternative cooling methods were explored: (1) cooling during a limited drawdown, and (2) cooling during a <b>degas</b> <b>operation.</b> Both methods employ the heat exchangers currently in place, and do not require extra equipment. An analysis was run using two heat transfer models, HEATEX, and CaveMan, both developed at Sandia National Laboratories. For cooling during a limited drawdown, the cooling water flowrate through the coolers was varied from 1 : 1 water:oil to about 3 : 1, with an increased cooling capacity of about 3 - 7 F for the test cavern Bryan Mound 108 depending upon seasonal temperature effects. For cooling in conjunction with a <b>degas</b> <b>operation</b> in the winter, cavern oil temperatures for the test cavern Big Hill 102 were cooled sufficiently that the cavern required about 9 years to return to the temperature prior to degas. Upon reviewing these results, the authors recommended to the U. S. Department of Energy that a broader study of the cooling during degas be pursued in order to examine the potential benefits of cooling on all caverns in the current degasification schedule...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{reduction}} of CO 2 emission as the greenhouse gas emitted {{in the largest}} volume due to human activities has become a primary focus in the last decade. Generally, in CO 2 gas purification technologies using chemical/physical absorption, the regeneration of solvent is carried out on high temperature and low pressure. This process is quite energy intensive and solvent consuming due to the evaporation loss. The ultrasonic insonation of the solution as a pioneering <b>degassing</b> <b>operation</b> promotes the developing of gas bubbles via rectified diffusion. In the physical models appeared in literature, {{the effect of the}} dissolution process on the bubble dynamics is usually neglected due to the different order of magnitudes of the respective timescales. This allows of using constant bubble mass in the equation of motion. Our investigated cases correspond to three different drive frequencies with both coupling and decoupling model settings. Numerical calculations are carried out for an adiabatic CO 2 microbubble by applying a spectral collocation method with Chebyshev polynomials. The obtained results pointed out an enhancement of the rectified diffusion rate by increase of the acoustical frequency at certain pressure amplitude. In addition, the damping effect of the mass diffusion process on the eigen-frequencies can be established in case of subharmonic- and close-to resonance cases.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} a high demand on clean steel for high {{performance}} materialproperties. Thus, steel producers try to deliver a steel product with the highestquality and cleanliness to the market. The number of parameters that affect thesteel cleanliness may vary depending on the required material properties of thefinal product. However, the non-metallic inclusion characteristics represent one ofthe most important parameters. More specifically, the composition, size, numberand morphology affect steel cleanliness. In this work, selected parameters affectingthe inclusion characteristics were studied using the following methods: i) thermodynamic calculations (including computational thermodynamiccalculations), ii) inclusion determinations using a cross sectional (CS) method (2 Dinvestigations) and iii) inclusion determinations using an electrolytic extraction(EE) method (3 D investigations). The computational thermodynamic calculations of the slag-steel and inclusion-steelequilibriums were carried out using the Thermo-Calc software. With the help ofthese calculations, the influence of the slag carryover on the top slag, aluminumcontent in steel and sulfur distribution ratio as well as predictions of stable phasesof inclusions were studied. In addition, inclusion determinations of tool steel gradesamples collected during various stages of the ladle treatment in a scrap-based steelplant were carried out using both 2 D and 3 D methods. Furthermore, inclusiondeterminations of bearing steel grade samples from a runner system after ingotcasting were performed using a 2 D metallographic method (CS-method). Also, theINCAFeature software was used, when using cross sectional method, in order tocollect more statistics of the inclusion characteristics. It was found that slag carryover has a large influence on the composition of theactual top slag as well as the aluminum content in the steel as well as the sulfurdistribution ratio. In addition, steel and slag were found to be in “near”-equilibriumconditions, after the completion of the vacuum <b>degassing</b> <b>operation.</b> Furthermore,the composition of small-size inclusions in samples taken from tool steel was foundto be very scattered. Moreover, the composition of the large-size inclusions wasfound to be less scattered. Furthermore, closer to the top slag composition insamples collected after vacuum degassing. Finally, the accuracy of the inclusioncomposition determinations of tool steel samples using the electrolytic extractionmethod was found to be better than for the cross sectional method. The worseaccuracy of the CS-method is due to a considerable effect of matrix elements oninclusion composition. QC 2010070...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Hydrogen causes defects, for which aluminiurn alloy products are rejected. The behaviour of hydrogen in aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy extrusion ingots, has been studied {{throughout the course of}} manufacture from freshly reduced aluminium. It is shown that hydrogen in the liquid metal is produced by temperature-dependent reaction between the metal and water vapour in the atmosphere. As the metal is received from the reduction cells, its temperature is - 850 'C and its hydrogen content, > 0. 4 cm 3 / 100 g, is too high for casting sound ingots. The metal is transferred first to a so-called melting furnace, where it is alloyed and stirred, thence to a holding furnace, where the composition is adjusted, the metal is degassed by gas sparging and allowed to settle before casting. The metal cools throughout these operations and as the temperature falls, the calculated value for the hydrogen content in equilibrium with the atmosphere falls in response to the reduced hydrogen solubility. The actual hydrogen content of the metal exhibited marked hysteresis in following the equilibrium value. Significant reduction of the hydrogen content occurred only when the metal was agitated. The hydrogen content never fell below the equilibrium value even during the nominal <b>degassing</b> <b>operation,</b> leading to the conclusion that gas sparging in a furnace does not positively remove hydrogen but only assists the equilibration. The hot-top DC casting process yielded a 8 m x 0. 18 m diameter ingot with a virtually uniform hydrogen content. When this ingot was homogenised by heating it to 590 ˚C in a 7 h cycle, a significant proportion of the hydrogen content was lost from the surface zone. By matching the loss to a theoretical model assuming diffusion control, it was shown that the loss of hydrogen is attenuated by trapping in micropores. The effects of simulated industrial atmospheres on the loss or absorption of hydrogen by the solid alloy were investigated in an extended series of laboratory heat-treatments. The interaction of the metal with these atmospheres was found to be determined {{by the nature of the}} oxide films formed and therefore the films were investigated by XPS and SIMS surface analysis techniques. In clean atmospheres the absorption or loss of hydrogen was determined by the balance between inward migration of protons and outward diffusion of hydrogen atoms through the oxide. Pollution of the air by chlorine or especially sulphur stimulated hydrogen absorption to a degree which seriously damaged the metal by pore growth. These effects are explained by modified compositions and structures in the surface oxide. United Arab Emirate...|$|E
