40|$|The widespread, {{economic}} {{utilization of}} geothermal energy {{is at least}} partly dependent on efficient methods for stimulation of geothermal wells and formations. The principal problem is temperature, which imposes chemical, physical and mechanical limitations on equipment and stimulation fluids. The restrictions become particularly serious when formation temperatures exceed the 350 ยบ to 400 ยบF range which of course are the better geothermal zones. Ironically, one stimulation technique which has lost favor in oil and gas fields offers promise geothermally. Explosive fracturing, particularly bore shooting, {{can be used to}} fracture formations adjacent to the well bore. For true stimulation, only bore shooting offers economic viability today in high temperature wells. Nevertheless, it is a long step from economic and technical feasibility to commercial reality; a major element in that step is the development of safe hardware and field operational procedures. Therefore, certain conditions must be met in order to qualify an <b>explosive</b> <b>stimulation</b> system for routine commercial use. These conditions will insure that the explosive charges cannot cause massive damage or injury to personnel above ground in case of an accident, and also will minimize the potential for serious damage to a well {{in the event of a}} mishap. Fortunately, these conditions are within the present state of the art, and can be incorporated into the design of charges and supporting hardware today. Given the new developments in low cost geothermal explosives, it appears that geothermal stimulation, using bore hole shooting, can be a commercial reality in less than two years...|$|E
5000|$|As a {{point of}} comparison, the most {{successful}} and profitable nuclear stimulation effort that {{did not result in}} customer product contamination issues was the 1976 Project Neva on the Sredne-Botuobinsk gas field in the Soviet Union, made possible by multiple cleaner <b>stimulation</b> <b>explosives,</b> favorable rock strata and the possible creation of an underground contaminant storage cavity. The Soviet Union retains the record for the cleanest/lowest fission-fraction nuclear devices so far demonstrated.|$|R
2500|$|The United States {{government}} {{continued with}} exploring the peaceful uses of nuclear detonations with Operation Plowshare, but was likewise eventually terminated in 1977. While social scientist, Benjamin Sovacool {{contends that the}} main {{problem was that the}} produced oil and gas was radioactive, which caused consumers to reject it. In contrast, oil and gas are sometimes considerably naturally radioactive to begin with and the industry is set up to deal with this, moreover in contrast to earlier stimulation efforts, contamination from many later tests was not a showstopping issue, it was primarily changing public opinion due to the societal fears caused by events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, that resulted in protests, court cases and general hostility that ended the US exploration. Furthermore, {{as the years went by}} without further development and the closing/curtailment in US nuclear weapons factories, this began to evaporate the economies of scale advantage that had earlier existed, with this, it was increasingly found that most US fields could instead be stimulated by non-nuclear techniques which were found to be likely cheaper.
