50|$|Responding to the cross-jurisdictional {{implications}} of the Herstatt debacle, the G-10 countries (the G-10 is actually eleven countries: Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States), Luxembourg and Spain formed a standing committee {{under the auspices of}} the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the committee comprises representatives from central banks and regulatory authorities. This type of settlement risk, in which one party in a foreign exchange trade pays out the currency it sold but does not receive the currency it bought, is sometimes called <b>Herstatt</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
50|$|One form of {{settlement}} risk is foreign exchange settlement risk or cross-currency settlement risk, sometimes called <b>Herstatt</b> <b>risk</b> after the German bank {{that made a}} famous example of the risk. On 26 June 1974, the bank's license was withdrawn by German regulators {{at the end of}} the banking day (4:30pm local time) because of a lack of income and capital to cover liabilities that were due. But some banks had undertaken foreign exchange transactions with Herstatt and had already paid Deutsche Mark to the bank during the day, believing they would receive US dollars later the same day in the US from Herstatt's US nostro. But after 3:30 pm in Germany and 10:30 am in New York, Herstatt stopped all dollar payments to counterparties, leaving the counterparties unable to collect their payment. The closing of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 did not cause similar problems because the Bank of England had set up a special scheme which ensured that payments were completed. Barings in 1995 resulted in minor losses for counterparties in the foreign exchange market because of a specific complexity in the ECU clearing system.|$|E
40|$|We exploit {{previously}} unpublished data {{on foreign}} exchange turnover to analyse the institutional {{setting in which}} the currencies of non-Japan Asia are traded. Volumes grew rapidly between 2004 and 2007 and the diversity of market participants increased. Nevertheless, liquidity is undermined by foreign exchange controls. For Asian currencies other than JPY, HKD and SGD, non-residents account for a relatively small share of activity and FX swap markets are still in their infancy. Offshore non-deliverable markets have developed in response to controls, causing segmentation in trading activity.

40|$|The {{development}} of Asian foreign exchange markets has progressed appreciably in recent years. Data from the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey {{indicate that the}} turnover of Asian currencies rose sharply between 2004 and 2007, financial institutions became more important customers, and the participation of non-residents increased. Notwithstanding this progress, the liquidity of Asian foreign exchange markets continues to be undermined by foreign exchange controls. For Asian currencies other than HKD and SGD, non-residents account for a relatively small share of activity and FX swap markets are still in their infancy. Offshore non-deliverable markets have developed in response to controls, causing trading activity to fragment. Furthermore, <b>Herstatt</b> <b>risk</b> remains high in Asian foreign exchange markets. Almost all transactions between Asian currencies are executed via the US dollar so, for those trades not cleared through CLS Bank, each leg is settled at significantly different times. foreign exchange, trading volume, currency controls...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at the {{prudential}} and regulatory measures needed to prepare India''s financial system to manage the risks arising from fuller capital account convertibility (FCAC). The paper contributes to the debate on FCAC in two ways. First, it reviews the potential and existing financial stability challenges to FCAC in India. Second it studies how prudential regulation and supervision is addressing these challenges. The main conclusion is that regulatory and supervisory measures alone are not enough and will need to be complemented by improvements in Indian banks'' risk management and further development of the domestic capital markets.

40|$|The UK {{is due to}} move to {{a system}} of {{real-time}} gross settlement (RTGS) later this year. Although the decision to move to RTGS was based on prudential concerns, this paper considers whether it has any implications for the implementation of monetary policy. In particular, the move could, in theory, lead to the development of an intra-day funds market which in turn would imply the existence of intra-day interest rates. Although the paper argues that such a market is unlikely to develop in the near term, it continues by developing a simple theoretical framework to analyse the intra-day funds market and the intra-day yield curve. The paper derives two main results from this model. First, intra-day interest rates of a given duration could be highly volatile, {{even in the absence of}} shocks, since rates will vary depending on how close to the end of the trading day the loan is taken out. Second, the provision of intra-day liquidity does not effect a central bank's ability to control one-day (or longer) interest rates. As long as intra-day loans have to be repaid at some point during the day, the Bank will retain control over the one-day interest rate. As a result, extending the opening hours of the intra-day market (i. e. the period over which the discount window is open) could help reduce <b>Herstatt</b> <b>risk</b> without unduly influencing monetary control. ...|$|E
40|$|The concept {{known as}} FX {{settlement}} risk (aka <b>Herstatt</b> <b>risk)</b> came into focus some {{thirty years ago}} when Bankhaus Herstatt, a small German bank, became insolvent leaving its counterparties with credit exposure equivalent to the nominal value of receivables in US dollar from FX transactions, for which they had already transferred their payables in Deutsch mark to the failed bank. There {{was no way to}} withdraw their payment orders. These events, however, shed some light on the – usually significant – risks inherent in clearing and settlement procedures of financial transactions. Under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), central banks set out in 1996 to take joint action and find a solution for this matter. They consequently came up with a methodology, which is now broadly used by a great many central banks for mapping and measuring FX settlement risk. The MNB undertook an analysis among banks active on the FX markets with questionnaires following the BIS methodology and personal interviews {{for the first time in}} October 2000, and published the results and observations in 2001 (MNB, 2001) under the title ‘Management of FX settlement risk in Hungary’. As the FX trading data indicated significant risks faced by the Hungarian banking system in terms of FX settlement, in 2005 the MNB decided to revisit the same area and conduct a survey similar to the review completed in 2000. The MNB received a significant boost in its efforts early in 2006 when BIS announced its intention to conduct a survey of the subject once again among the G 10 central banks. The objective of this study is to analyse – relying on 2006 data – FX settlement risk that may arise in the domestic banking system under its current operations, and to chart the changes which took place after 2000, covering improvements and, if necessary, formulating (new) recommendations to reduce risks. As will be referred to in many cases, this study actively relies on the material published in 2000, including the methodology it describes in detail. As a number of central banks (for example Riksbank and Norges Bank) are using the BIS methodology plus other (regular and specific) statistical reports to analyse FX settlement risk in the credit institution sector, along with all its consequences for financial stability, this latest analysis involves a deeper approach, reaching somewhat beyond the constraints of the 2000 publication. In the first chapter we will demonstrate how FX settlement risk is treated among other risks to which banks are exposed, including its dimensions and the impact it may have on financial stability, and the means available to reduce risks in general. The second chapter contains a brief description of the 2006 survey and a summary of general views and overall concepts relating to the information obtained through the questionnaires and personal interviews. The third chapter provides an analysis of the data conveyed in the 2006 survey and – minus the composition effect – a comparison of the results from 2000 and 2006. The fourth chapter offers an overview of the personal interviews, and at the end a summary of the results, conclusions and recommendations for future purposes, where deemed necessary.
