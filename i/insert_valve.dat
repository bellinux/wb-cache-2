They compared its performance to a conventional Savonius wind turbine and found that with valves on a three-bladed turbine, the power coefficient was higher compared to a two-bladed turbine for both semi-circular and twisted blades. Without valves, air strikes the blades and rotates them in a negative direction. Saha et al. also varied the number of stages in a Savonius wind turbine and found that while the power coefficient increased from one to two stages, it decreased from two to three stages due to increased inertia.

50|$|The {{drawback}} to the monobloc head is {{that access to}} the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) becomes difficult.

This is a frequent problem in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, and its main hemodynamic consequence is the generation of high transvalvular gradients through normally functioning prosthetic valves. The purposes of this report are to present an update on the concept of aortic prosthesis–patient mismatch and to review the present knowledge with regard to its impact on hemodynamic status, functional capacity, morbidity and mortality. Also, we propose a simple approach for the prevention and clinical management of this phenomenon because it can be largely avoided if certain simple factors are taken into consideration before the operation...|$|R
40|$|Mitral valve {{replacement}} with posterior leaflet preservation was shown beneficial for postoperative left vetricular (LV) performance {{in patients with}} mitral regurgitation. Some authors find it beneficial even {{for the long term}} LV function. We investigated a long term effect of this technique in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. We studied 20 patents with mitral {{valve replacement}} due to rheumatic mitral stenosis, in the period from January 1988. to December 1989. In group A (10 patients) both leaflets and coresponding chordal excision was performed, while in group B (10 patients) the posterior leaflet was preserved. In all patients a Carbomedics <b>valve</b> was <b>inserted.</b> We compared clinical pre and postoperative status, as well as hemodynamic characteristics of the valve and left ventricle in both groups. Control echocardiographyc analysis included: maximal (PG) and mean (MG) gradients; effective valve area (AREA); telediastolic (TDV) and telesystolic (TSV) LV volume; stroke volume (SV); ejection fraction (EF); fractional shortening (FS) and segmental LV motion. The mean size of <b>inserted</b> <b>valve</b> was 26. 6 in group A and 27. 2 in group B. Hemodynamic data: PG (10. 12 vs 11. 1); MG (3. 57 vs 3. 87); AREA (2. 35 vs 2. 30); TDV 126. 0 vs 114. 5); TSV (42. 2 vs 36. 62); SV (83. 7 vs 77. 75); EF (63. 66 vs 67. 12); FS (32. 66 vs 38. 25) Diaphragmal segmental hypokinesis was evident in one patient from group A and in two patients from group B. In patients with rheumatic stenosis, posterior leaflet preservation did not have increased beneficial effect on left ventricular performance during long-term follow-up. An adequate posterior leaflet preservation does not change hemodynamic valvular characteristics even after long-term follow-up...|$|R

30|$|In this context, the {{implementation}} of the paradigm of “divide and conquer” in a WDN allows simplifying the management, defining sub-systems named District Meter Areas (DMAs), by <b>inserting</b> gate <b>valves</b> and flow meters along network pipes, properly selected, in order to define a Water Network Partitioning (WNP). In this way, it is possible to improve water losses identification (Water Industry Research Ltd, 1999), control district pressure (Alonso et al, 2000), and protect users from accidental and intentional contamination (Di Nardo et al, 2015 b), because these activities are simpler to achieve if the network is divided in sub-systems. By dividing the water network in DMAs, implementing innovative Information and Communications Technology (ICT) remote-controlled devices and big data analysis, it is possible to change the traditional approach to the management of WDN, transforming the water systems into modern Smart Water Network (SWAN) (Di Nardo et al, 2016 a), considered as part of Smart Cities.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the significance of}} the results of microbiological cultures of heart valves and identification tags from newly <b>inserted</b> prosthetic <b>valves</b> that were removed from patients with valvular heart disease; none of these patients had a preoperative diagnosis of endocarditis. We reviewed the charts of patients with positive cultures for evidence of infections before or after surgery. Cultures were positive for 11. 9 % of 219 valves (206 native valves and 13 prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves) and 11. 6 % of 224 tags. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci. Typical agents of endocarditis-viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus jaecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus-were cultured from five specimens, and Mycobacterium avium complex was identified in six valves. None of the patients with positive valve or tag cultures developed postsurgical endocarditis or wound infection. Findings on histopathologic examination of the valves were not consistent with endocarditis. We conclude that the results of cultures of valves from patients without preoperative diagnoses of endocarditis lack clinical significance, and positive tag cultures are not predictive of postsurgical infection. Positive cultures are most likely a result of contamination during surgery or thereafter. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a significant cause o...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} amniotic membrane {{in the management of}} painful bullous keratopathy secondary to the intractable glaucoma and in preventing exposure of drainage devices, we <b>inserted</b> Ahmed <b>valve</b> with amniotic membrane patch graft over the implant itself, and debrided corneal epithelium with amniotic membrane graft over the exposed stroma as a single operation. During the follow-up periods, we monitored vision, intraocular pressure (IOP), presence of ocular pain, and postoperative complications associated with the implants. The mean follow up period was 8. 4 ± 3. 2 months. IOP was well controlled after the intervention. The preoperative mean IOP was measured as 43. 9 ± 9. 0 mmHg and lowered to 16. 1 ± 1. 8 mmHg at the last visit and no complications associated with the implants were noted. Even though the improvement in vision was not prominent, the ocular surface stabilized rapidly and ocular pain associated with bullous keratopathy disappeared soon after surgery.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the utility of the EFVR to quantify the indexed EOA in patients with an aortic bioprosthesis and left ventricular dysfunction considering an indexed EOA value of 0. 85 cm(2) /m(2) or less to be indicative of a prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM), defined as an EOA of the <b>inserted</b> prosthetic <b>valve</b> of less than that of the normal human valve. Methods. We studied 100 patients (62 men and 38 women; mean age +/- SD, 71 +/- 8. 6 years) with an aortic bioprosthesis and left ventricular dysfunction (EF 0. 85 cm(2) /m(2)) also showed an indexed EOA of greater than 0. 85 but less than or equal to 1. 0 cm(2) /m(2) (meaning the presence of a mild PPM). Conclusions. The EFVR can be considered a reliable echocardiographic alternative to the CE, especially in conditions in which that is technically difficult, allowing identification of a PPM (indexed EOA <= 0. 85 cm(2) /m(2)) with excellent sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
