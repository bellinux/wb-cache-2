My {{clothing}} seemed good, but the ditch had soiled it. I had no hat, nor could the farmer find one when I sent {{him back to}} look for it. My mind was not wholly a blank; I {{seemed to have a}} fair knowledge of life, and when the farmer mentioned New York the city seemed familiar to me. But in regard to myself, my past history--even my name--I was totally ignorant. All personal consciousness dated from the moment <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ditch." ...|$|E

Had I heard it mentioned I would have known nothing about it and cared as little. I know all about it now--its size, its standing, its military significance. Yesterday the news that the Germans have captured it in their second rush to Warsaw made my heart sink into my boots. <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night and worried over it.

60|$|As I {{had grown}} {{accustomed}} to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very well {{that it was not}} all good. I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night,--like Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.|$|E

60|$|I had not shed a tear before, but now I cried tempestuously, and {{clung to}} him like a shipwrecked little mariner in a storm. Neither spoke, but he held me fast and let me cry myself to sleep; for, when the shower was over, a pensive peace fell upon me, and the dim old garret seemed not a prison, but a haven of refuge, since my boy came {{to share it with}} me. How long I slept I don't know, but it must have been an hour, at least; yet my good Christy never stirred, only waited patiently till <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twilight, and was not afraid because he was there. He took me down as meek as a mouse, and kept me by him all that trying evening, {{screening}} me from jokes, rebukes, and sober looks; and when I went to bed he came up to kiss me, and to assure me that this awful circumstance should not be reported at home. This took a load off my heart, and I remember fervently thanking him, and telling him I never would forget it.|$|E
6000|$|You {{see how far}} my {{imagination}} had gone towards readjustment when Mary returned into my life. You see how strange and distant it was to meet her again, changed completely into the great lady she had intended to be, speaking to me with the restrained and practised charm {{of a woman who}} is young and beautiful and prominent and powerful and secure. There was no immediate sense of shock in that resumption of our broken intercourse, {{it seemed to me that}} night simply that something odd and curious had occurred. I do not remember how we parted that evening or whether we even saw each other after dinner was over, but from that hour forth Mary by insensible degrees resumed her old predominance in my mind. <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night and thought about her, and next day I found myself thinking of her, remembering things out of the past and recalling and examining every detail of the overnight encounter. How cold and ineffective we had been, both of us! We had been like people resuming a disused and partially forgotten language. Had she changed towards me? Did she indeed want to see me again or was that invitation a mere demonstration of how entirely unimportant seeing me or not seeing me had become? ...|$|E

There wasn't a soul in sight. But just level with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you'd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked the place {{carefully}} in my own mind, so that I'd find it again. There was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air. I thought I'd slip into another carriage. But the woman called me back, said I'd dropped something, and when I stooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here." [...] She placed her hand {{to the back of her}} head.

5000|$|Cierach founded her own couture business, Lindka Cierach Couture in 1979. Her first {{commission}} was a wedding dress for a Bahraini princess, which {{enabled her to}} establish a client base in the Middle East. Cierach entered the global spotlight in 1986, when she designed the wedding dress for Sarah Ferguson's marriage to The Duke of York. Cierach is quoted to have described the designing of the dress thus: [...] "I wanted the Duchess of York's sense of fun and joy {{to come out in}} the dress. One day <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the night and}} had dreamed it, and that was it".

50|$|A {{successor}} to the Cypherpunks of the 1990s, CryptoParty was conceived in late August 2012 by an Australian privacy advocate (who goes by the nom de plume Asher Wolf) in a casual Twitter conversation with computer security experts following {{the passage of the}} Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and the proposal of a two-year data retention law in that country, the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The DIY, self-organizing movement immediately went viral, with a dozen autonomous CryptoParties being organized within hours in cities throughout Australia, the US, the UK, and Germany. “When <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, they were all there,” Wolf said in an interview. Asher organised the @cryptoparty Twitter account, paid @hellojaffe to set up the wiki, organised a logo, and promoted the idea, and the need to contribute to the handbook on Twitter. Many more parties were soon organized or held in Chile, The Netherlands, Hawaii, Asia, etc. Tor usage in Australia itself spiked, and CryptoParty London with 130 attendees -some of whom were veterans of the Occupy London movement- had to be moved from London Hackspace to the Google campus in east London's Tech City.|$|E
5000|$|Cullinan's poetry, often (in {{his earlier}} works) {{permeated}} by the Transvaal landscape, {{is most often}} concerned with the personal rather than the political; with emotional and metaphysical themes, such as his poem [...] "My Predawn Owl". Exemplified by this poem, his work is carefully crafted, often lyrical, and at one with the tradition of W. B. Yeats. His work draws from the cultural tradition inspired by major figures such as Dante and Eugenio Montale. While he was inspired and informed by such European tradition, Cullinan firmly identified himself as an African writer: I spent seven years, {{from the age of}} 14 to 21 in Europe (mainly, because I had no choice, in England), so I certainly ingested a great deal of European-ness. Therefore, when I came back to South Africa at the age of 21, I had a problem. Was I in fact a European, or an African? I remember sitting in a cottage in the Eastern Transvaal, on the Escarpment, thinking it through one night. When <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, I didn't have to think of it any longer: I was an African, and I always would be." ...|$|E
