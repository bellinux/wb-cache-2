5|$|<b>Everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> disbelief that Stewie {{would try}} to murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and {{explains}} what happened.

While at a white supremacist rally, she takes a blow to the head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E

25|$|In Asterix and Obelix All at Sea, Asterix, Obelix and Getafix go to {{the remains}} of Atlantis (said to be the present-day Canaries) to seek the secret of age {{reversal}} as Obelix was accidentally reverted to childhood.

25|$|The {{apartment}} {{resembles a}} prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily {{on all of}} us. As none of us do much, we haven’t got much to tell each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the same black pit, there isn’t much point in repeating time and again that we can’t see clearly.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first episode, Wishology includes references from three recent films: The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. In Timmy's first trilogy wish, Timmy—under his alias Teo—is dressed as Neo from The Matrix, while his school teacher, Mr. Crocker, is dressed as Neo's antagonist, Agent Smith. Timmy dodges Mr. Crocker's lasers in a style similar to that seen in The Matrix. [...] After doing so, he jumps off a building and lands on, and crushes, a Volkswagen New Beetle. In his second trilogy wish, the group arrives at Middle-earth. Timmy is dressed as Frodo; Wanda and Poof are dressed as Hobbits; and Cosmo takes the appearance of Gollum. In the third, Harry Potter-themed trilogy wish, where <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a Quidditch match, Timmy is dressed as the film's main character, Harry Potter, Vicky is dressed like Voldemort, and Poof {{takes the form of a}} quidditch snitch.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.5 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, highlighting the reunion {{of the six}} original team members and their evolved dynamic, despite {{what he called a}} [...] "contrived" [...] set up for that situation. He felt that using the characters of List and Hill to tie the series into Age of Ultron was [...] "the right way" [...] to tie the two together, and was also positive of the character beats for Simmons and Palamas. Goldman also made special mention of Tancharoen's direction of the one-shot fight, though he felt that Tancharoen's May vs. Agent 33 fight from [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] was the superior sequence, and of the visual effects for the shooting down of the Bus. The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] a 'B+', also noting that [...] "has to take some shortcuts to reunite the original team, but the momentum picks up considerably once <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the same room". Discussing the changed in the main characters {{from the start of the}} series, Sava particularly noted the development of Skye into [...] "kick-ass Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and praised Tancharoen as [...] "the one director on this series that is really going out of his way to create memorable action sequences". Sava called the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "overt", with Raina's clairvoyance [...] "a convenient plot device to put certain pieces in place", but ultimately felt that [...] "those big-screen connections don’t interrupt the focus on relationships".|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E

2500|$|Without recommending {{one form}} of {{government}} over another, Leo put forth some principles for the appropriate role of the State in good government. The primary purpose of a State is {{to provide for the}} common good. [...] All people have equal dignity regardless of social class, and a good government protects the rights and cares for the needs of all its members, both rich and poor. Leo also pointed out that <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> some way a contributor to the common good and everyone's contribution is important.|$|E
2500|$|Seurat's Bathers preceded A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, {{which shows}} {{people on the}} bank of the other side of the river. While the bathers at Asnieres on the left bank are working-class people, it is the bourgeoisie who are on the right bank. The bathers are cast in light, while on the Grande Jatte almost <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> shadows, and there are allusions to lust (a woman with a monkey on a leash) and {{prostitution}} (a woman [...] "fishing"). Seurat's message has been interpreted as implying that the working class represented the future, while the middle classes had grown decrepit and ridden with vice. Seen in this light and context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears to be calling out to them, as if to say [...] "we are the future, come and join us".|$|E

He knew Finkle had been spying on him while practicing and thus knew how good he was at shooting.|$|R
5000|$|I cannot {{conceive}} of more conflicting psychological elements meeting under similar conditions without explosion. Almost <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love or hate and only Mary Foote could come {{cutting through the}} snarled air like a cool smooth silver fruit-knife, severing at the crucial moments the crossed threads that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> danger of becoming firmly knotted entanglements.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a curious}} scene it is, Percy," [...] Ralph said. [...] "Who {{would think that}} we were in a besieged city? Everything looks very much as usual: the shops are open; people walk about and chat, and smoke, and drink their coffee or absinthe, just as usual. The only {{difference}} is, that <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> some sort of uniform or other. One does not see a single able-bodied man altogether in civilian dress; and at night the streets are very dismal, owing to there being no gas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is our skating place," [...] {{the count}} {{said as they}} entered. [...] "We have guest-nights here once a week during the winter. As a rule, those present are simply the invited guests of members; but to-night the tickets are sold at twenty roubles each, and the {{proceeds}} go to the funds {{for the benefit of}} the wounded. It will furnish a handsome sum, for everyone is here, and there are few indeed who have paid as little as the twenty roubles. Some sent cheques for as much as five hundred roubles for their tickets, and a hundred may be taken as the average. This is the first time that we have had a military band, for music is naturally considered out of place when <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> mourning and such vast numbers of our soldiers are still suffering horribly; but as this is for their benefit it is considered as an exception. You will not see much skating; the ice will be far too crowded." ...|$|E
