40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for simultaneous motion tracking of left ventricle and coronary arteries from cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. We first use the multi-scale vesselness filter proposed by Frangi et al. 1 to enhance vessels in the cardiac CTA images. The vessel centrelines are then extracted as the minimal cost path from the enhanced images. The centrelines at end-diastolic (ED) are used as prior input for the motion tracking. All other centrelines are {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of the motion tracking. To segment the left ventricle automatically, we perform three levels of registration using a cardiac atlas obtained from MR images. The cardiac motion is derived from cardiac CTA sequences by using local-phase based non-rigid registration. The CTA image at each time frame is registered to the <b>ED</b> <b>frame</b> by maximising the proposed similarity function and following a serial propagation scheme. Once the images have been aligned, a dynamic motion model of the left ventricle can be obtained by applying the computed free-form deformations to the segmented left ventricle at ED phase. A similar propagation method also applies to the coronary arteries. To validate the accuracy of the motion model we compare the actual position of the coronaries and left ventricle in each time frame with the predicted ones as estimated from the proposed tracking method...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} newspaper {{coverage of the}} Democratic and Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates in the 2008 U. S. election. Since the composition of candidates involved in this election is so unprecedented, this study seeks to uncover {{the ways in which}} they are portrayed through the lens of framing theory. The study focused on three major frames: experience, race and viability. A total of 225 newspaper articles randomly collected from The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and USA Today were content analyzed. The following questions were asked: What is the most dominant frame used in the coverage of the 2008 election? Is there a relationship between the dominant frame used and candidate focus? Is there a difference in the way news articles and non-news articles (feature stories, editorial/op <b>ed.)</b> <b>frame</b> candidates? Which received the greater amount of media attention in the 2008 election, image or issue-focused stories? What aspects of image are most frequently used in describing the candidates? How frequently is age used to describe the candidates in the 2008 election? How frequently is gender mentioned to describe the candidates? The results show that consistent with previous research, the media continue to place a greater importance on candidate image and viability than on policy issues. The media paid little attention to the subject of age, but discussed race, gender and experience more thoroughly. The discussion of gender and the one female candidate was stereotypical and used harsher and more negative language than that used for the male candidates, especially when found in editorial/op ed. articles. This suggests that contrary to what many believe were improving conditions for female political candidates, the media still put a much greater emphasis on their gender than for their male counterparts...|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} component in computing quantitative diagnostic metrics, such as ejection fraction, as well as, image segmentation and registration is the accurate {{identification of the}} end-systolic (ES) and end-diastolic (<b>ED)</b> <b>frames</b> in cine MRI. Localization of the LV is also important, to assist further analysis (ie., myocardial segmentation). Currently, these tasks are performed in a manual, semi- or fully-automated fashion. Fully-automated methods are desirable since they can eliminate manual labor and inter- and intra-observer variability. Most methods rely on measuring {{the area of the}} blood pool in the LV chamber, but they are computationally intensive,susceptible to noise, and require prior localization and segmentation of the LV.

40|$|Background: Identifying End-Diastole (ED) and End-Systole (ES) frames {{is highly}} {{important}} {{in the process of}} evaluating cardiac function and measuring global parameters accurately, such as Ejection Fraction (EF), Cardiac Output (CO) and Stroke Volume. Objectives: The current study aimed to develop a new method based on measuring volume changes in Left Ventricle (LV) during cardiac cycle. Material and Methods: For this purpose, the Level Set method was used both in detecting endocardium border and quantifying cardiac function of all frames. Results: Demonstrating LV volumes displays <b>ED</b> and ES <b>frames</b> and the volumes used in calculating the required parameters. Conclusions: Since ES and <b>ED</b> <b>frames</b> exist in iso-volumic phases of the cardiac cycle with minimum and maximum values of LV volume signals, such peaks can be utilized in finding related frames...|$|R

30|$|Image {{analysis}} was performed manually using QMass MR (version 7.6, Medis, Leiden, The Netherlands) [13] by a CMR expert (EW who has 9  years of experience in CMR analysis) in a totally blind fashion to the SPECT findings. The ES and end-diastolic (<b>ED)</b> <b>frames</b> were visually selected. The basal slice was selected {{with the aid of}} long-axis cine view images. Slices at the apex were included when blood was clearly visible. Contours were drawn manually by tracing the endocardial and epicardial borders in every slice at ED and ES. Contour tracing was aided by reviewing the multiple phase scans in the movie mode. Papillary and trabecular muscles were considered to be inside the LV cavity. LV volumes and EF were derived from all short-axis images according to a modified Simpson’s rule.|$|R
40|$|Object of {{this study}} is to provide a new method to {{estimate}} right ventricular volume. The right ventricle (RV) is a complex crescent-shaped structure and, contrary to the left ventricle, it cannot be suitable with any simple geometric model existing in medical literature. To test RV volume estimation based on level set method, we performed RV endocardial surface detection on reconstructed cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies. Level set algorithm has been integrated into a package for 3 D reconstruction of medical images, navigation and processing. The semi-automatic procedure has been applied to end-systolic (ES) and enddiastolic (<b>ED)</b> <b>frames</b> of MRI data belonging to 5 patients affected by dilative and infiltrative pathologies and 5 affected by congenital heart diseases. This study demonstrates the feasibility of accurate evaluation of RV chamber size and shape, even in case of irregular geometry. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} component in computing quantitative diagnostic metrics, such as ejection fraction, as well as, image segmentation and registration is the accurate {{identification of the}} end-systolic (ES) and end-diastolic (<b>ED)</b> <b>frames</b> in cardiac cine MRI. Reliable identification of ES is also important in cardiac phase-resolved myocardial blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI studies (1). An assessment of changes in myocardial oxygenation requires BOLD images to be collected at rest and stress, which is typically induced with intravenous infusion of adenosine. ES images at both states are compared to assess the presence of coronary artery stenosis. To increase reproducibility and eliminate variability it is desirable to automate this procedure. Most automated methods relying on trigger times do not account for anatomical correspondence, while methods based on identifying the minimum and maximum of the blood pool area in the Left Ventricle (LV) chamber, are computationally intensive, susceptible to noise, and require prior localization and segmentation of the LV. The purpose of this work is to develop automated methods to facilitate in the robust and reproducible evaluation of cardiac cine MRI studie...|$|R

I flesh out this picture, arguing that the notion of “structure” is best understood as of two sorts: There is “material structure” as the definition of the concrete material object of design as recognized above, but there is structure again in a formal sense - as abstract, engineering models and representations of the “parts” of the design (object- worlds here). It is this latter “formal structure” of the parts and their place in the whole that participants in design work to define, given the stated functional requirements of the whole.

40|$|Many of the Y- 12 Plant buildings, {{constructed}} {{during the}} 1940 s and 1950 s, consist of steel <b>ed</b> concrete <b>framing</b> infilled with hollow clay tile (HCT). The infill {{was intended to}} provide for building enclosure and was not designed to have vertical or lateral load-carrying capacity. During the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, seismic and wind evaluations were performed on many of these buildings {{in conjunction with the}} preparation of a site-wide safety analysis report. This analytical work, based on the best available methodology, considered lateral load-carrying capacity of the HCT infill on the basis of building code allowable shear values. In parallel with the analysis effort, DOE initiated a program to develop natural phenomena capacity and performance criteria for existing buildings, but these criteria did not specify guidelines for determining the lateral force capacity of frames infilled with HCT. The evaluation of infills was, therefore, based on the provisions for the design of unreinforced masonry as outlined in standard masonry codes. When the results of the seismic and wind evaluations were compared with the new criteria, the projected building capacities fell short of the requirements. Apparently, if the buildings were to meet the new criteria, many millions of dollars would be required for building upgrades. Because the upgrade costs were significant, the assumptions and approaches used in the analyses were reevaluated. Four issues were identified: (1) Once the infilled walls cracked, what capacity (nonlinear response), if any, would the walls have to resist earthquake or wind loads applied in the plane of the infill (in-plane) ? (2) Would the infilled walls remain within the steel or reinforced concrete framing when subjected to earthquake or high wind loads applied perpendicular to the infill (out-of-plane) ? (3) What was the actual shear capacity of the HCT infill? (4) Was modeling the HCT infill as a shear wall the best approach...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} was to describe the epidemiology of emergency department (ED) visits for attempted suicide and self-inflicted injury over a 16 -year period. METHOD: Data {{were obtained from the}} National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey including all visits for attempted suicide and self-inflicted injury (E 950 -E 959) during 1993 - 2008. RESULTS: Over the 16 -year period, there was an average of 420, 000 annual ED visits for attempted suicide and self-inflicted injury [1. 50 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 33 - 1. 67) visits per 1000 US population], and the average annual number for these ED visits more than doubled from 244, 000 in 1993 - 1996 to 538, 000 in 2005 - 2008. During the same time <b>frame,</b> <b>ED</b> visits for these injuries per 1000 US population almost doubled for males (0. 84 to 1. 62), females (1. 04 to 1. 96), whites (0. 94 to 1. 82) and blacks (1. 14 to 2. 10). Visits were most common among ages 15 - 19, and the number of visits coded as urgent/emergent decreased from 0. 95 in 1993 - 1996 to 0. 70 in 2005 - 2008. CONCLUSIONS: ED visit volume for attempted suicide and self-inflicted injury has increased {{over the past two decades}} in all major demographic groups. Awareness of these longitudinal trends may assist efforts to increase research on suicide prevention. In addition, this information may be used to inform current suicide and self-injury related ED interventions and treatment programs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Research has {{consistently}} indicated {{that fear of}} stigma is a pertinent factor when understanding the poor prevalence of treatment seeking among individuals with mental illness, particularly eating disorders (EDs). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the treatment experiences of ED sufferers within an Australian context, in addition to exploring patient views on <b>framing</b> <b>EDs</b> as biogenetic conditions, given the increased understanding and presentation of EDs as biologically based conditions. Methods: Semi-structured online data collection was conducted with 35 Australian women with a history of an ED (54. 3 % in treatment, 45. 7 % in “recovery” or “recovered”). The data were evaluated using a three-phased coding system, allowing findings to emerge from significant themes inherent within the raw data (thematic analysis). Results: Treatment was perceived as traumatic, punitive, blaming, lacking in understanding/education, and overemphasised the physical dimensions of the illness. The experience of volitional stigma in the health “care” system was frequent and expected, and for many sufferers had adverse effects. Biogenetic framing was perceived to be more likely to reduce (rather than exacerbate) stigma, particularly perceptions of volition and personal responsibility. Although reductions in blame and responsibility were welcomed, there was concern that biogenetic explanations could negatively impact recovery by endorsing genetic fatalism and encouraging self-fulfilling prophecies via genetic essentialism. Conclusions: Overall, findings highlight that attention to volitional stigma within the health system is required (particularly education) and that aetiological framing (with caution and sensitivity) is perceived to be a feasible stigma reduction method by ED sufferers...|$|R
