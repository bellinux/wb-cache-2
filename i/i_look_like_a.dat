It begins with a video {{featuring}} Madonna in a glamorous dress cavorting with bare-bodied males juxtaposed with Mike Tyson talking inside of a cage. Tyson commented about the shooting, saying: [...] "Riveting is not [...] It's just intense... I'm in a cage. I'm a hostage. I'm chained. I'm naked. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> savage. When I [...] it, it didn't seem that intense. But then you watch it and go, 'Whoa'. It was like [...] National Geographic. I need to be tamed, man." [...] Madonna performed wearing an [...] "ornate kimono-like robe with wide sequin-lined sleeves" [...] inside a medieval-looking cage surrounded by religious iconography that she later breaks out of as she sings the first lines, while guards dressed {{similar to the ones}} who guarded the Wicked Witch of the West's castle marched onstage. During the performance, she also hung upside down on a cross.|$|E
500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comedian?' No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Do I wish {{right this}} second I {{had a better}} {{relationship}} with Cory Lidle? Yeah, I absolutely do, (but) {{you got to do}} what you got to do. I don't know what to tell you. You can make the argument that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> heel. ... I've been ripping him for five or six months. Does that make me a bad guy? I'll let others evaluate that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the celebrity preview {{a group of women}} wearing army jackets, pea coats, jeans and boots and {{carrying}} protest signs demonstrated outside the cinema against the film, which they thought was anti-women's liberation. When Darling heard about this, she said, [...] "Who do these dykes think they are anyway?... Well, I just hope they all read Vincent Canby's review in today's Times. He said <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cross between Kim Novak and Pat Nixon. It's true– I do have Pat Nixon's nose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ji {{accepted}} {{a position in}} the wartime government in Chongqing, where he lived in the same rooming-house as Adler. One senior Nationalist Party official, Chen Lifu, later complained that the intelligence agencies knew of Ji's communist connections but that Finance Minister H.H. Kung trusted Ji because they were from the same province and Kung respected Ji's father. The next Finance Minister, T. V. Soong, Chen continued, was American trained and could not speak Chinese well. Soong and Ji got along because they both had a better command of English than Chinese, Chen charged, and that Ji fed damaging policies to both Kung and Soong, but Chiang Kai-shek trusted and defended them because they were married to his wife's sisters. Ji Chaozhu, Ji's brother, recalled that Kung had once demanded" [...] "Chaoding, tell the truth. Are you a Communist?" [...] Knowing that a Communist might be tortured or executed, Chaoding replied, [...] "Uncle, I have followed you these many years... Do <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Communist to you?" ...|$|E
