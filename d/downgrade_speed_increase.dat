30|$|Figures  8 a and 9 a {{depicts the}} {{relationship}} of packet delivery ratio with respect to node speed for both the protocols. Decrease in the trend is observed {{because of the fact}} that link fails easily as node <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> However, the rate of decrease of packet delivery ratio for SGFL is obviously higher than that of POR. That is because POR is distance based routing protocol, link failure often occurs due to node mobility, and data packets are dropped upon experiencing a link failure. Figures  8 b and 9 b highlights the comparison of delays for SGFL and POR protocols. It is evident from the experimental outcome that, delays vary as node <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> That is because as node <b>speed</b> <b>increases,</b> topology changes faster, which more easily leads to link failure and triggers route rediscovery process, thereby raising an increase in transmission delay. However, the routing protocols indicate different performances. SGFL has smaller variation in end to end delay than POR, which indicates an improvement in transmission delay as node <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> Figures   8 c and 9 c shows the routing overhead with the increase of node mobility. Routing overhead is increased for both protocols as the node <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> However routing overhead of SGFL slower than POR. The reason behind this is the novel methodology employed by proposed SGFL in selection of next hop forwarder and backup node. This imparts stability to inter-node communication by decreasing the possibility of packet loss during transmission. The results in Figs.  8 (d, e) and 9 d show that our protocol SGFL dominates over POR with respect to average energy consumption, even when the node <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The parallelization and {{vectorization}} of Monte Carlo algorithms for modelling charge transport in {{semiconductor devices}} are considered. The standard ensemble Monte Carlo simulation of a three parabolic band model for GaAs is first presented as partial verification of the simulation. The model includes scattering due to acoustic, polar-optical and intervalley phonons. This ensemble simulation is extended {{to a full}} device simulation {{by the addition of}} real-space positions, and solution for the electrostatic potential from the charge density distribution using Poisson's equation. Poisson's equation was solved using the cloud-in-cell scheme for charge assignment, finite differences for spatial discretization, and simultaneous over-relaxation for solution. The particle movement (acceleration and scattering) and the solution of Poisson's are both separately parallelized. The parallelization techniques used in both parts are based on the use of semaphores for the protection of shared resources and processor synchronization. The <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> results for parallelization with and without vectorization on the Ardent Titan II are presented. The results show saturation due to memory access limitations at a <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> of approximately 3. 3 times the serial case when four processors are used. Vectorization alone provides a <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> of approximately 1. 6 times when compared with the nonvectorized serial case. It is concluded that the <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> achieved with the Titan II is limited by memory access considerations and that this limitation is likely to plague shared memory machines for the forseeable future. For the program presented here, vectorization is concluded to provide a better <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> per day of development time than parallelization. However, when vectorization is used in conjunction with parallelization, the <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> due to vectorization is negligible...|$|R
