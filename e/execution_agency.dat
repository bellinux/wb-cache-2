Tokio calls him [...] "the darkness" [...] right before he is killed. It then flashes forward two years to the modern day where Mondo is accepted into Bryan's <b>execution</b> <b>agency</b> following his assassination of the former executioner in his place, who had also {{been taken over by}} a dark force and was deemed unfit for his job. This man, Damon, warns Mondo about the perils of the job and that he may also fall to the dark side.|$|E
5000|$|The fictional Special <b>Execution</b> <b>Agency</b> (S.E.A.) sends three {{operatives}} {{from their}} Phantom Unit, Billy Bishop, Sheila Crawford and Nicklaus Nightwood; {{onto the roof}} of Castle Wolfgang in Austria. Eve, SEA's commanding officer, informs them that the terrorist group Enigma is inside the castle, {{and they must be}} stopped before they can utilize their bio-weapon [...] "Lahder". The trio are successful in infiltrating the castle, but Nicklaus is captured in the process. The player infiltrates a chapel within the castle by posing as Enigma's second-in-command, Dietrich Troy. Inside, Bishop and Sheila are confronted by the real Dietrich, as well as Enigma's anonymous leader and a group of guards. Dietrich displays Nicklaus hung upon a crucifix, shooting and killing him as the leader leaves. A flashback commences once Nicklaus has died.|$|E

40|$|Part (A) of {{the case}} is about how Shashank Nigam, CEO of SimpliFlying Pte Ltd, a company based in Singapore, {{searches}} for the corporate strategy and vision for his company. SimpliFlying was founded in March 2008, and was originally a blog, which commented on issues in marketing aviation. After thinking about how he could find a niche for his business, Nigam decided to sell his company’s services by combining the three pillars of aviation, marketing and technology through social media. However, he recognised that he still needed {{to decide on the}} long-term positioning of the company – should SimpliFyling focus on strategy consulting, or strategy <b>execution</b> (<b>agency)</b> work, or both. At the same time, Nigam’s company was also receiving calls from hotels to help them with branding projects. In the end, Nigam decides that the company should handle business that was related to aviation strategy only. Part (B) {{of the case}} covers a specific project that SimpliFlying is handling. By November 2011, SimpliFlying had developed into a reputed aviation market strategy consulting and training firm. Estonian Airline’s social media loyalty programme was not only SimpliFlying’s second major airline project, but also the first airline loyalty programme in the world to be driven purely by social media. Despite the challenging timeline – only eight weeks from conceptualisation to launch – SimpliFlying had managed to deliver beyond expectations. However, Nigam had to consider if the approach he had used {{was the best way to}} implement bigger projects going forward...|$|E

40|$|Title III of the JOBS Act {{took effect}} in May 2016 {{and it began}} {{a new chapter in}} equity {{crowdfunding}} in the United States by providing an opportunity for entrepreneurial ventures to solicit funding from non-accredited investors. Due to the relative novelty, little is known about factors that can affect equity crowdfunding success under Title III. To address this gap in research, we draw on the risk capital framework and we examine the effects of market, <b>execution</b> and <b>agency</b> risks in equity crowdfunding under Title III. We collect data on 133 ventures that attracted more than $ 11 million in funding commitments across sixteen Title III equity crowdfunding platforms. We find that all three types of risks can affect the likelihood of successful fundraising under Title III. We discuss the implications of these findings for entrepreneurs, investors, crowdfunding platforms and policy makers...|$|R

40|$|The {{annual budget}} {{process is a}} primary {{financial}} control mechanism over community resources. However, in New Hampshire, some business school leaders do not have effective strategies for proper budget creation and <b>execution.</b> Using <b>agency</b> theory to frame this study, {{the purpose of this}} explanatory case study was to explore strategies for proper budget creation and execution in local school administrative units (SAUs) in New Hampshire. The targeted population was comprised of New Hampshire SAU business administrators who had operational responsibility for the administration of the yearly public budgets in each school district. Data were collected from SAU document review and semi structured interviews of seven SAU business administrators. Through a data extraction process, 6 themes emerged, which included appropriate accounting controls, risk management, enhancing the procedures, usefulness of fund balance information, use of governmental standards to develop more decision-making information, and improved operation procedures. The implications for positive social change may include the potential to establish accounting controls in the SAUs to complete balanced budgets. The results of the study indicate the potential impact of property tax revenue collected from the citizens of New Hampshire to balance local SAU school budgets...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} mean-variance optimal <b>agency</b> <b>execution</b> strategies, when the market liquidity and volatility vary randomly in time. Under specific assumptions for the stochastic processes satisfied by these parameters, we construct a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the optimal cost and strategy. We solve this equation numerically and illustrate optimal strategies for varying risk aversion. These strategies adapt optimally to the instantaneous variations of market quality. A fundamental part of agency algorithmic trading in equities and other asset classes is trade scheduling. Given a trade target, that is, a number of shares that must be bought or sold before a fixed time horizon, trade scheduling means planning how many shares will be bought or or sold by each time instant between the beginning of trading and the horizon. Grinold and Kahn (1995) and Almgren and Chriss (2000) suggested that the optimal trajectory could be determined by balancing market impact cost, whic...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} for discussion is whether {{in cases of}} agency by ratification the doctrine that notice to the agent is notice to the principal has any application. Some of the general principles from which the argument is to proceed may be set forth in a few sentences. Where one without the semblance of authority assumes to act as the agent of another, that other may ratify the act and thereby acquire the rights and assume the obligations {{that would have been}} his had the agent 2 ̆ 7 s assumed authority been actual. In like manner, where an agent, whose authority is limited, acts on his principal 2 ̆ 7 s behalf beyond the scope of that authority, the principal 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent ratification is, in most respects at least, equivalent to actual prior authority. Further, where an agent is acting for his principal, within the scope of his authority, notice to or knowledge possessed by the agent, germane to {{the subject matter of the}} agency and affecting the <b>execution</b> of the <b>agency,</b> will with some exceptions be deemed to be notice to or the knowledge of the principal. This knowledge must have been acquired by the agent while he was acting as such; or, if acquired previously, must have been actually present in the agent 2 ̆ 7 s mind during the <b>execution</b> of his <b>agency,</b> and it must have been knowledge which he was at liberty to disclose to his principal. In cases where the knowledge of the agent is relied upon to affect the validity or the consequences of action on the part of the principal himself, the communication of such knowledge must have been within the scope of the agent 2 ̆ 7 s duty and there must have been an opportunity, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, to communicate such knowledge to the principal before he acted. Neither in cases where the agent is acting nor in cases where the principal is acting will notice to the agent be deemed notice to the principal where it is known to be to the agent 2 ̆ 7 s own interest to conceal his knowledge from his principal, or where he is known to be violating his duty and is acting in fraud of or contrary to the interest of his principal...|$|R
30|$|In {{crowdfunding}} context, civic crowdfunding {{refers to}} the direct funding of civic, or community projects initiated by governments (Carvajal et al. 2012). With the increased popularity of this approach as an alternative way of financing, and with the increased pressure faced by governments today to be more responsive to their citizens’ needs and more transparent in their policy formation and <b>execution,</b> many public <b>agencies</b> have started investigating the potential of crowdfunding in reforming their financing approach to public services and projects. To distinguish these types or uses of crowdfunding from the conventional use by individuals or entities from the private sector, we {{refer to them as}} civic crowdfunding. In the literature, civic crowdfunding {{refers to the}} direct funding of public, civic, or community projects by citizens, in collaboration with local, federal, or national governments (Davies 2015; Hollow 2013; Lehner 2013). As the crowdfunding market grows, platforms are increasingly exploring and expanding how applications of the model in a broad range of civic crowdfunding projects ranging from physical structures to public services. Examples of civic crowdfunding platforms include Spacehive, Neighbor.Ly, Citizinvestor, IOBY, and Patronhood. These platforms allow both citizens and governments to project civic ideas or public projects such as parks, playgrounds, railroads, and airports, potentially opening up whole new sources of investment for public goods (Davies 2015).|$|R
5000|$|Like the Hoover Commission, {{this group}} was {{chartered}} {{at the request of}} President Truman, and was made up of Allen W. Dulles, who had served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the Second World War and would become DCI in 1953, William Jackson, a future Deputy DCI, and Matthias Correa, a former assistant to Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal when the latter had served as Secretary of the Navy during the war. Chaired by Dulles, the ISG presented its findings, known as the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, to the National Security Council on January 1, 1949. Partially declassified in 1976, it [...] "contained fifty-six recommendations, many highly critical of the CIA and DCI. In particular, the report revealed problems in the <b>agency's</b> <b>execution</b> of both its intelligence and operational missions. It also criticized the quality of national intelligence estimates by highlighting the CIA's—and, by implication, the DCI's--"failure to take charge of the production of coordinated national estimates." [...] The report went on to argue that the CIA's current trend in clandestine intelligence activities should be reversed in favor of its mandated role as coordinator of intelligence." [...] It was [...] "particularly concerned about the personnel situation at CIA, including internal security, the high turnover of employees, and the excessive number of military personnel assigned to the agency." [...] See the continuing concern about personnel in the 1954 Doolittle Report To add [...] "continuity of service" [...] and the [...] "greatest assurance of independence of action," [...] the report argued that the DCI should be a civilian and that military appointees be required to resign their commissions.|$|R
40|$|This thesis takes a {{corporate}} political strategy perspective of antidumping and countervailing duty cases {{to understand why}} some firms are more successful at the prosecution of these trade remedy measures. Trade remedy measures are long standing tools of US trade policy and their use has continued to grow globally amongst member countries of the World Trade Organisation. Between 1980 and 2007 a total of 1606 of these trade remedy cases were investigated by the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission, an average of 41 antidumping and 17 countervailing duty cases a year, with a value of around US$ 63 billion or 0. 3 % of all US imports. Thirty-seven {{percent of the cases}} by number and 54 % by value resulted in duties being imposed on the subject imports. This study uses archival material for five recent trade remedy investigations and forty-five semistructured interviews with business interests, trade attorneys and economic consultants that have experience of prosecuting these cases to understand why some firms may be more successful than others at achieving their preferred policy outcome. The imposition of duties is found to be only the simplest measure of success for US firms that file a case and does not capture the range of potential outcomes for foreign firms that face the duties. Successful prosecution of a trade case {{has been found to be}} firm specific, as the DOC determination of individual firm duty rates significantly affects what the outcome of case means for each firm in the US and foreign industries. The successful prosecution of US trade remedy cases is argued to be an informational corporate political strategy that is affected by statutory and administrative biases in the <b>execution</b> of the <b>agency</b> investigations, and creates the potential for indirect rent-seeking bias in the outcomes of cases. This informational corporate political strategy is based on three capabilities that firms need to develop, the capability to gather information, the capability to build and shape the administrative record at the agencies to reflect a firm’s policy preferences and the capability to align business practices with the US trade remedy institutions. These three capabilities are enabled by the bundling of corporate political expertise resources, organisational resources, financial resources and reputational resources. Some of these resources are internal to the firms, including staff, money and information, while other resources are external, such as the trade attorneys and economic consultants.
