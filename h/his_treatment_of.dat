5|$|Eugene Ellsworth Landy (November 26, 1934– March 22, 2006) was an American {{psychologist}} and psychotherapist {{best known for}} his unconventional 24-hour therapy, as well as for ethical violations concerning <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson in the 1980s.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the natives in Congo Free State.

5|$|The film {{portrays a}} {{struggle}} between inmates and the warden of a military prison, based on the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.

5|$|The {{same year}} as Gian Gastone's marriage, the Peace of Ryswick ended the Nine Years' War: French troops withdrew from the Electoral Palatinate and Johann Wilhelm {{received}} the County of Megen.

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. <b>His</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|By 1166, Foliot {{had been}} {{presented}} with a petition for annulment of the marriage of Aubrey de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope to affirm the validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for {{his handling of the}} case.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, {{played a crucial role}} in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.|$|E
5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. <b>His</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|In this work, Eakins took {{advantage}} of {{an exception to the}} generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers).|$|E

5|$|The hymn is {{probably}} {{best known as the}} basis for Bach's funeral motet of the same name, BWV 227. Scored for five vocal parts—two sopranos (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)—Bach alternates the stanzas of the chorale and text from Paul's epistle to the Romans. Within an overall symmetrical structure, he varies <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the verses of the hymn: stanzas 1 and 6 are the same simple four part setting; stanzas 2 and 4 are settings with the cantus firmus in the soprano and an expressive accompaniment in the lower three or four voices; stanza 5 is a chorale fantasia with the cantus firmus in the alto; and stanza 3 is freely composed with no connection to the hymn tune.|$|E
5|$|The {{king had}} seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was {{particularly}} tough on that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had {{strong support from}} the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed {{there had to be}} recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in <b>his</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), proved more lenient.|$|E
