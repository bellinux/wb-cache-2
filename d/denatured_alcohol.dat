Some chemical compounds, although not synthesized from pyridine, contain its ring structure. They include B vitamins niacin and pyridoxine, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, nicotine and other nitrogen-containing plant products. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar and as a byproduct of coal gasification. However, increased demand for pyridine resulted in the development of more economical methods of synthesis from acetaldehyde and ammonia, and more than 20,000 tonnes per year are manufactured worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Risk of a false {{decision}} on conformity of a multicomponent material or object due to measurement uncertainty is discussed. Even if conformity assessment for each {{component of a}} material sample is successful, the total probability of a false decision (total consumer's risk or producer's risk) concerning the sample as a whole might still be significant. A model of the total probability of such false decisions is formulated based on the law (theorem) of total probability. It is shown that the total risk can be evaluated as {{a combination of the}} particular risks of conformity assessment of sample components. For a more complicated task, i. e. for a larger number of components of a sample under control, the total risk is greater.

50|$|Rarely, {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in methylated spirits, <b>denatured</b> ethyl <b>alcohol,</b> to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. Methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages.|$|R

2500|$|Methanol {{has a high}} {{toxicity}} in humans. As {{little as}} 10mL of pure methanol, ingested, is metabolized into formic acid, which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve. [...] ThirtymL is potentially fatal, although the median lethal dose is typically 100mL (3.4floz) (i.e. 1–2mL/kg body weight of pure methanol). The reference dose for methanol is 2mg/kg-day. Toxic effects begin hours after ingestion, and antidotes can often prevent permanent damage. Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol (the alcohol in beverages), {{it is difficult to}} differentiate between the two (such is also the case with <b>denatured</b> <b>alcohol,</b> adulterated liquors or very low quality alcoholic beverages). However, there are cases of methanol resistance, such as that of Mike Malloy who was the victim of a failed murder attempt by methanol in the early 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Ethanol has a {{tendency}} to denature some organic compounds, rendering them so changed as to be ineffective. This is one reason why ethanol is an antimicrobial. This tendency can also have undesirable effects when extracting botanical constituents, for instance, polysaccharides. Certain other constituents, common among them proteins, can become irreversibly denatured, or [...] "pickled" [...] in a manner of speaking. Also, extracted for highly complex aromatic components are <b>denatured</b> by <b>alcohol's</b> intrinsic cleaving action upon an aromatic's complex structure into simpler inert-rendered compounds. A basic tenet of organic chemistry teaches that any time a biologically viable component is denatured, it will reduce or negate its prior biological viability. This fact must be considered by the clinician and/or consumer from both the standpoint of efficacy and dosage when choosing ethanol-based botanical tinctures.|$|R

A poisonous substance may be added as an even more powerful deterrent. For example, methanol is blended with ethanol to produce <b>denatured</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The addition of methanol, which is poisonous, renders <b>denatured</b> <b>alcohol</b> unfit for consumption, as ingesting <b>denatured</b> <b>alcohol</b> may result in serious injury or death.

The survey, conducted between late 2012 and early 2013, involved 156 families for a total of 487 people, a significant sample corresponding to 3 % of the population. People involved in the survey were generally interested in the topic. In regard to the use of health facilities for first aid, {{it should be noted that}} about 62 % of people use sodium hypochlorite and <b>denatured</b> ethyl <b>alcohol</b> as disinfectants. Some medical devices were widely present; in particular, the device for nebulisation of drugs used to treat respiratory tract disorders was present in 81. 4 % of households. The drugs for first aid generally belonged to the C band of SSN classification (with some exceptions such as lansoprazole, used as a gastric protector); only 27 % of the above was provided by SSN. The drugs found in the sample families were mainly represented by antipyretics, anti-inflammatories and painkillers (44 %), and of the gastrointestinal tract medicines (28 %). The drugs devoted to the treatment of specific diseases were present with 6. 1 packs per family, compared to 8. 2 packs for drugs of first aid. Examining the distribution of drugs in the various ATC categories, the highest rates were found for the cardiovascular system (16. 7 % with a peak of 30 % in the last age group), eating disorders and metabolism (11. 5 %) and respiratory tract (11. 0 %) drugs. The expired drugs amounted to an average of a pack per family with a residual of 44 % of the overall content, for those of first aid, and 0. 7 packs with a residual 59 %, for medicines used for specific diseases. A comparison of the percentages of expired drugs and those in use highlights that the use of NSAIDs is a nearly exhaustive, insignificant percentage NSAIDs expired being found. The results were discussed in relation with: the tendency to self-medication and the opportunity to improve the awareness of citizens; the possibility of response to economic hardship, evidenced by the 16. 7 % of respondents; the opportunity for the recovery of active principles from expired drugs in order to reduce environmental pollution; the importance of a participatory management of research...|$|R
