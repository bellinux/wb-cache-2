2500|$|Afro-Cuban jazz {{has been}} {{for most of its}} history, a matter of {{superimposing}} jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. However, by the early 1980s a generation of New York City musicians had come of age playing both salsa dance music and jazz. The time had come for a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry and Andy, who in 1967, at the ages of 15 and 13, formed a Latin jazz quintet inspired by Cal Tjader's group. Jerry plays congas and trumpet and Andy plays bass. During 1974–1976 they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's most experimental salsa groups. Andy Gonzalez recounts: [...] "We were into improvising[...] [...] doing that thing Miles Davis was doing—playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set." [...] While in Palmieri's band the Gonzalez brothers started showing up in the Down Beat Reader's Poll. In 1974, the Gonzalez brothers and Manny Oquendo founded the progressive salsa band Libre. While in the band, the brothers began experimenting with jazz, using a variety of authentic Afro-Cuban rhythms. Libre recorded Charlie Parker's [...] "Donna Lee" [...] as a danzón, Miles Davis's [...] "Tune Up" [...] as a conga de comparsa, and Freddie Hubbard's [...] "Little Sunflower" [...] as a mambo. In 1979, Jerry Gonzalez released his first album as a leader: Ya yo me curé. His Afro 6/8 rendition of Wayne Shorter's [...] "Nefertiti," [...] accompanied by three shekeres and a <b>hoe</b> <b>blade</b> as the only percussion, was a jazz milesone. Soon he formed his best-known band: Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band which included his brother Andy and other members as Kenny Kirkland, Sonny Fortune, Nicky Marrero, Milton Cardona, Papo Vazquez and the late Jorge Dalto. The ensembles first two albums were recorded live at European jazz festivals, The River is Deep (1982) in Berlin and Obatalá (1988) in Zurich. These were followed by their hit album, Rumba Para Monk (1988), earning them recognition from the French Academie du Jazz with the Jazz Record of the Year award. This was the record that caught the ears of the jazz community, and is still considered a stellar project. After that, the 15 member-band was compressed into a sextet: Larry Willis (piano), Andy Gonzalez (bass), Steve Berrios (Drums) and Carter Jefferson (sax) and Joe Ford (sax). The Fort Apache Band had established by this time, a new standard for the integration of jazz and Afro-Cuban music.|$|E

40|$|New camera {{technology}} {{capable of}} detecting crop rows {{makes it possible}} to employ selective weed control in cereals. Normally cereals are grown at 12. 5 cm row spacing in Northern Europe but even a moderate extension of the row spacing can make enough room for implementing automatically steered inter-row hoeing. Experiences from practice have shown that camera-based steering systems can guide a <b>hoe</b> <b>blade</b> accurately in a 20 - 25 cm wide inter-row space. The steering systems have also improved work rates by increasing implement width and forward speeds and the technology is gradually being employed on an increasing number of organic farms in Denmark. Growers claim that crop injuries are negligible and weeding effectiveness against problematic weed species has improved compared with weed harrowing. However, the cereal cropping system has not been optimized to the usage of inter-row cultivation. Inter-row weeds are mostly effectively controlled whereas intra-row weeds, i. e. those growing in the crop lines, are only partly controlled by soil coverage if the <b>hoe</b> <b>blade</b> causes some sideward soil movement into the crop rows. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the interaction between surviving intra-row weeds and crop growth under the influence of crop species, inter-row spacing and nitrogen rate. Results are reported from three year’s field experimentation with spring barley and spring wheat grown according to organic standards. It was aimed to maintain a constant seed rate for five row spacing studied (12. 5, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm), which resulted in a higher crop density in the rows with increasing row spacing. Denser intra-row crop stands also resulted in more crop biomass per crop row meter which lead to more intra-row weed suppression, especially at the high nitrogen rate (100 kg NH 4 -N versus 50 kg NH 4 -N). Other cropping factors can also play a significant role in the suppression of intra-row weeds in cropping systems for cereals where inter-row cultivation is applied. Further increasing the cereal seed rate can increase crop density and thus weed suppression, fertilizer placement can benefit the crop more than the weeds and pertinent choice of crop varieties with specific attributes for intra-row weed suppression may also become a useful tactic...|$|E

40|$|Balinese {{farmer in}} doing their daily {{activities}} in agricultural work still relay on their hand tools. One {{of the hand}} tools used is the hoe. In fact there are two type of hoe, fork type and single <b>blade</b> <b>hoe.</b>   The single <b>blade</b> <b>hoe</b> is very rare used for hoeing in wet rice field. Farmer chose the fork type one. Therefore, a {{study was conducted to}} compare the efficacy of those two hoes. Twenty farmers were participated voluntarily. They were divided into two groups evenly. The first group hoeing using the fork type hoe, and the second group using the single blade one. They hoeing in the same area of rice field (wet rice field) from 07. 00 until 12. 00. The parameter measured were resting and working heart rate, product and productivity, musculoskeletal disorders, and the deep of soil hoed. The student-t test was applied to analyses the results. The results found are: a) the working heart rate, the product and productivities were 111. 1 ± 14. 66 bpm; 127. 74 ± 9. 15 m 2; 0. 54 ± 0. 00 and 110. 2 ± 13. 88 bpm; 126. 88 ± 8. 79 m 2; 0. 54 ± 0. 00  for first group and second group, respectively. The MSD and the deep of soil hoed were 4. 50 ± 1. 97; 30. 0 ± 2. 54 cm and   4. 45 ± 2. 03; 29. 64 ± 1. 75 cm for both groups. There are no significant different found statistically. Therefore, it is concluded that the efficacy of single <b>blade</b> <b>hoe</b> is similar to the fork type hoe for hoeing the wet rice field in the tropic. For further study it is recommended to use these two hoes for hoeing in the dry soil. [MEDICINA 2009; 40 : 43 - 6]. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flex-tine weed {{harrowing}} conducted as a full-width operation treating both {{crop and}} weeds {{is the principal}} method for direct weed control in organic spring cereals in Northern Europe. Results with this technology have varied considerably where especially crop injuries and control failures against tall-growing and tap-rooted weed species have been major drawbacks. New camera technology capable of detecting crop rows {{makes it possible to}} employ selective weed control in spring cereals. Normally cereals are grown at 12. 5 cm row spacing in Northern Europe but even a moderate extension of the row spacing can make enough room for implementing automatically steered inter-row hoeing.

However, the cereal cropping system has not been optimized to the usage of inter-row cultivation. Intra-row weeds, i. e. those growing in the crop lines, are not controlled and increasing the row spacing to 25 cm or more may cause a yield penalty. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the interaction between inter-row cultivation, inter-row spacing and nitrogen rate on weed and crop growth. Results are reported from two years field experiments with spring barley and spring wheat. It was aimed to maintain a constant seed rate for all five row spacing studied (12. 5, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm), which gave a higher crop density in the rows with increasing row spacing. A denser intra-row crop stand would improve the suppression of surviving intra-row weeds and partly compensate for the more weed growth that wider row spacing would cause by allowing more light penetration into the crop canopy. It was found that maintaining the seed rate when increasing row spacing was important for preserving crop yields. The best results in terms of weeding effectiveness and crop yield were achieved with 15 and 20 cm row spacing and high N rate; most evident in spring barley. It was seen that the traditional ‘Ducksfoot’ blade is not an optimal solution for inter-row cultivation at small row spacing. As a consequence, a new blade has been developed which is also presented at the WSSA 2016 Annual Meeting...|$|E
50|$|The powered {{rotary hoe}} {{was invented by}} Arthur Clifford Howard who, in 1912, began experimenting with rotary tillage on his father's farm at Gilgandra, New South Wales, Australia. Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be {{mechanically}} tilled without soil-packing occurring, {{as was the case}} with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an L-shaped blade mounted on widely spaced flanges fixed to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I. In 1919 Howard returned to Australia and resumed his design work, patenting a design with 5 rotary <b>hoe</b> cultivator <b>blades</b> and an internal combustion engine in 1920.|$|R

A Dutch <b>hoe</b> has a <b>blade</b> [...] "sharp on every side so as to cut either forwards and backwards". The blade must be set in a plane slightly upwardly inclined in relation to the dual axis of the shaft. The user pushes the handle to move the blade forward, forcing it {{below the surface of the}} soil and maintaining it at a shallow depth by altering the angle of the handle while pushing. A scuffle hoe can easily cultivate soil and remove weeds from the surface layer.|$|R

This last scene is particularly impressive, in that is successfully captures the lives of the peasants and their hard-bred wisdom, both of which sustain themselves without break during the most turbulent of times. Song writes that their lives are [...] "the hardest sort of earth, and an enormous and mysterious force in that earth which pushes upward to rise through the cracks it will make and the holes it will bore without regard for rock or the sharp edges of <b>hoes</b> or <b>blades</b> of shovels." [...] In “Again at Wolmunli”, the conclusion of the Wolmunli series, the scene in which the protagonist, in prison, hears of his mother’s death is repeatedly juxtaposed with the scene of his visit to her grave until the two are brought to an end with the protagonist’s conviction that he 'will not live as easily as mother'. The protagonist’s appreciation and understanding of his mother, and his own self-revelations {{at the end of the}} poem-cycle combine to produce a highly affecting and memorable piece. Song’s most recent work, Come to Me, I Will Gladly Go to You (Neoege gama naege ora) is set in a marketplace and portrays the great pains of the common people in their search for love and hope. Although their lives are tainted by despair, insanity, and violence, the author convincingly portrays their corrupt behavior as arising not from a corrupt nature, but from their desolation. Song’s lyrical style is here particularly effective in portraying their grotesque lives as possessing a shimmering, haunting beauty.|$|R
40|$|New Ploughing Effects on Cyperus rotundus L. in New Caledonia. I. Effects of Rotary Hoe and Circular Spike Harrow. Because of {{the biology}} of Cyperus rotundus, the worst weed in {{vegetable}} crops in New Caledonia, tillage may imply positive or negative effects on it's development. Consequently, in two fields with low and high densities of C. rotundus, a study was undertaken {{of the impact of}} a rotary hoe (Rotavator) and a circular spike harrow during new ploughing on the state and the distribution in the soil of tubers and chains of tubers. The main effect of the circular spike harrow, with its round teeth, is to bring tubers up to the surface. The rotary <b>hoe,</b> with its <b>blades,</b> cuts off more tubers and chains of tubers than the circular spike harrow, especially in field with a high weed invasion. By cutting off the chains of tubers, the rotary hoe can stimulate new growth of C. rotundus, consequently the frequent use of the rotary hoe may rapidly increase the numbers of tubers in the soil. These results give {{a better understanding of the}} effects of mechanical practices on the development and growth of C. rotundus and lay the groundwork for an effective weed integrated management in New Caledonia...|$|R
