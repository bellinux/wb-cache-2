2500|$|Smith, poor fellow, {{has died}} of wounds. I passed {{him on his}} way down â€“ though hit in seven places, his courage was wonderful. I asked him how he felt & <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile [...] "There is some lead in me which ought not to be there & I am afraid I have done in your tunic. I am awfully sorry".|$|E
60|$|No, La Certe {{had come}} to do none of these things, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conciliatory smile.|$|E
60|$|The judge bowed slightly. 'The {{question}} {{requires no}} answer,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet emphasis. I burned bright scarlet.|$|E
6000|$|Apparently Mr. Dimmidge {{expected}} {{something more}} than this reply, for after <b>a</b> moment's hesitation <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd smile: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which {{of those}} two {{surveyor}} fellows is it, Clemmy?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> engaging smile, yet halting at a strategic distance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{amount of}} small change, Missis,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{abstracted}} air, {{after a little}} meditation, 'might you call a morsel of money?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} again stared curiously at him. After a pause <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> half-pitying, half-humorous smile: [...] "Pike--aren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung?' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{vigorous}} suavity, {{his voice}} curling {{up in the}} question.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{will make}} me wretched?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{scarcely}} perceptible movement across his face, as from some darting sensation.|$|E
6000|$|... "As usual," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{underhung}} sneer-"bowin' your heads {{before the}} Oppressor {{that comes to}} spend his leisure gloatin' over you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{your head}} is level, Lottie!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> admiration that was not, however, without a weak reserve of suspicion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon so," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{exasperating}} smile. [...] "Most fellers do. But she ain't Miss Johnson no more. She's married." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{remained}} blank a moment, {{and then}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile of relief, of deprecation, of protest, of amazement, of compassion-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Lord, I {{have the}} honour to congratulate your Lordship,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magnificence only marred by his {{difficulty}} in rising.|$|E
6000|$|... "Governor," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> keen {{look in his}} big, ox-like eyes, [...] "you've been {{complaining}} to Billy about your rheumatism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't cry--don't cry," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd simplicity. His {{heart was}} calm and numb <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of innocence of love, now.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with,</b> <b>an</b> almost equal severity, [...] "Miss Triscoe is on board. Miss Triscoe-and-her-father. She {{wishes to}} come down and see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Biscuits," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{elaborate}} {{working of}} his jaws, intended {{to convey the}} idea {{that they were going to}} be specially delicious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has Mrs. Bonner {{not told}} you?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shaking voice;--"there's some secret. You {{give her the}} letter, Lady Clavering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{peculiar}} smile, [...] "Theurdank--Dankwart--I see! May I ask if {{your son}} likewise smelt out the Schlangenwald?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stuck his}} hands into his pockets and descended the staircase. When he was five or six steps above them, he spoke. [...] "Just sit down here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gesture of one hand, and sat down himself upon the stairs. [...] "DO sit down," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden testiness as they {{continued}} standing. [...] "I know all about this affair. Do please sit down and let us talk.... Everybody's gone to bed long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Herbert," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affectionate smile, [...] "forgive me {{for being}} a little late. Baroness, I am delighted to see you--and Louise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's yer downy," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt at}} jocularity. [...] "Now you'd better hit de hay, fer youse must be dead fagged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't refuse," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{effect of}} {{difficult}} concession. [...] "I will come. I will drive over at once, after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|Not {{until they}} had arrived nearly at the house did Master Plummer make any remark, and then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long-drawn sigh: ...|$|E
6000|$|Syme {{received}} the remark with stolidity, imagining {{it to be}} a joke. Accepting the vein of humour, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> well-bred indifference-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{blue eyes}} opened wide, and Jack's own sunshiny smile {{broke through the}} tears that filled them as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sniff,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there's {{no reason}} for anxiety!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> over-acted {{interest}} in examining his cigar. [...] "Mr. Oxbye is in good hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawford gazed rather blankly {{across the}} {{twilight}} fields. 'I was wondering,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> oddly naive candour, 'how {{long it took}} one to sink.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The water {{seemed to}} revive him. [...] "The rattlesnakes scared the cowards," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attempt to smile. [...] "Were there many rattlers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--I--I--no--no. I know I am very foolish--ungrateful. But I do hate you,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden impulse, 'and I'll {{tell you}} why.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wander {{far from}} home to-day," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deferential salutation, for Hake's bondage had not robbed him of his breeding.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{once knew}} {{a man like}} you, Lucifer," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> maddening monotony and {{slowness}} of articulation. [...] "He took this----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ruggedo {{promptly}} {{threw his}} sceptre at his Royal Chamberlain, who dodged {{it with his}} usual cleverness, and then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attempt to swagger: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odd {{mingling}} of reproach and suspicion. [...] "I declare I saw a light {{here just}} this minit! That's queer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, now," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{unpleasant}} confidential leer, [...] "weren't {{you surprised}} to see us come back--eh? Straight now, between man and man?" ...|$|R
