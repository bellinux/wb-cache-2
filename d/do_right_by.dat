As he tries to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> the public, he soon finds himself {{in the midst of}} the cover-up, and the target of an assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E
500|$|In {{many ways}} {{similar to the}} {{stereotype}} of charismatic black Marines found in other science fiction (such as Sergeant Apone in Aliens whom Johnson was partially based on), some publications found Johnson, though enjoyable, somewhat of a flat character. In an interview for , Joseph Staten of Bungie admitted that Johnson was a static character in Halo: Combat Evolved, and that despite the character's potential, [...] "he sort of inherited those caricature aspects [...]" [...] Contact Harvest was a chance [...] "to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> Johnson, {{to give him the}} rich, fully fleshed out back-story he deserves, that we {{have never been able to}} give him in the game." ...|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of being}} about Marty's love for Shiloh, {{most of the}} novel occurs in Marty's {{thoughts}} such as when he ponders about telling falsehoods to his parents. Because the book was considered [...] "very internal" [...] by the major film studios, director Dale Rosenbloom labored over making the film more external. Rosenbloom added new characters and scenes to the story and faxed each change to the novel's author. Naylor was neither fearful of Rosenbloom's changes nor unhesitant at suggesting changes. After the film was released, Naylor said that Rosenbloom [...] "did a very good job", and Rosenbloom said, [...] "We did <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> the book and her ... She lives by her code and if you honor it, she appreciates it." [...] By June 1997, Naylor had seen the film six times. In an interview that month, she noted that she was always struck by the hush of the theater and by how the film entrances everyone, even the children.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, St. John and Howarth {{simultaneously}} began {{contract negotiations}} with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, {{who was with}} the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although {{he was not able}} to comment on contracts, the producers were [...] "doing our best to make sure that we <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> the audience". [...] In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. [...] The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. [...] Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, [...] "Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John", whose portrayal of Todd he found [...] "very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way".|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Ashna {{faces the}} choice between being true to herself and <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> her family and society.

2500|$|Mild-mannered and courtly, Green {{strongly}} {{believed in}} an evangelical [...] "Christian cooperation" [...] worldview {{similar to the}} social gospel, in which men of good moral character would <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> one another if only they committed themselves to Christ. Green's views dovetailed with those of Woll, who advocated a cooperative rather than adversarial relationship with management.|$|E
2500|$|The {{culture and}} {{intellectual}} {{output of the}} Jewish community in Poland {{had a profound impact}} on Judaism as a whole. Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as Polania or Polin in Hebrew, and as transliterated into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as [...] "good omens" [...] because Polania can be broken down into three Hebrew words: po ("here"), lan ("dwells"), ya ("God"), and Polin into two words of: po ("here") lin (" [...] dwell"). The [...] "message" [...] was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of Sigismund I the Old until the Nazi Holocaust, Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi David ben Shemu’el ha-Levi (Taz) that Poland was a place where “most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> Israel” (Divre David; 1689).|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} LP contained five songs per side. The {{liner notes}} present June Christy's {{reaction to the}} project, quoting her as saying, [...] "This has been absorbing as well as sentimental for all concerned.

I think we succeeded in <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> them." ...|$|R

She is a woman that always <b>does</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> {{everyone}} and <b>does</b> not have a single flaw in the novel. At a young age she had to act as the woman of her house because {{of the death of}} her mother and practically raised her little brother Frank.|$|R
2500|$|Mezzo Muriel Smith, co-creator (double-cast with soprano Muriel Rahn) of the Broadway {{title role}} in Oscar Hammerstein's [...] "Carmen Jones," [...] {{creator of the}} role of Bloody Mary in the {{original}} London cast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "South Pacific," [...] whose more important movie ghost-singing assignments included dubbing for Zsa Zsa Gabor in John Huston's original film version of [...] "Moulin Rouge" [...] and for Juanita Hall in 1958's [...] "South Pacific," [...] turned down Samuel Goldwyn's offer to portray Bess, responding, the work [...] "[...] [...] Doesn't <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>by</b> my people." [...] This statement contradicts another that Samuel Goldwyn's first and only choice for Bess was Dorothy Dandridge, who accepted the role without enthusiasm. Her Carmen Jones co-stars Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters, and Diahann Carroll also accepted roles, but all of them had concerns about how their characters would be portrayed. Bailey warned costume designer Irene Sharaff she would not wear any bandannas because she was unwilling to look like Aunt Jemima.|$|E
