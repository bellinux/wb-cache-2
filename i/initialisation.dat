25|$|The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit {{protected}} mode kernel {{at the core}} of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real mode <b>initialisation</b> segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking. It runs multiple applications simultaneously by sharing CPU (central processing unit) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run.|$|E
500|$|The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) {{model is}} a {{specialized}} version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones. The model {{was developed by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and Florida State University. It became operational in 2007. [...] Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Other than the specialized guidance, global guidance such as the GFS, Unified Model (UKMET), NOGAPS, Japanese Global Spectral Model (GSM), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, France's Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and Aire Limit´ee Adaptation Dynamique <b>Initialisation</b> (ALADIN) models, India's National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMWRF) model, Korea's Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) and Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System (RDAPS) models, Hong Kong/China's Operational Regional Spectral Model (ORSM) model, and Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) model are used for track and intensity purposes.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{methodology}} for facial landmark detection. Similar to other state-of-the-art methods, {{we rely on}} the use of cascaded regression to perform inference, and we use a feature representation that results from concatenating 66 HOG descriptors, one per landmark. However, we propose a novel regression method that substitutes the commonly used Least Squares regressor. This new method makes use of the L 2, 1 norm, and it is designed to increase the robust- ness of the regressor to poor <b>initialisations</b> (e. g., due to large out of plane head poses) or partial occlusions. Furthermore, we propose to use multiple <b>initialisations,</b> consisting of both spatial translation and 4 head poses corresponding to different pan rotations. These estimates are aggregated into a single prediction in a robust manner. Both strategies are designed to improve the convergence behaviour of the algorithm, so that it can cope with the challenges of in-the- wild data. We further detail some important experimental details, and show extensive performance comparisons highlighting the performance improvement attained by the method proposed here...|$|R

As a consequence, in the limit of many weak connections per neuron, Hopfield networks exactly implement a continuous-time variant of belief propagation starting from message <b>initialisations</b> that prevent from running into convergence problems.

These results have a number of implications for the vision and robotics community, and show that the application of visual motion estimation on robotic platforms in an online fashion is approaching real-world feasibility...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} quantum circuit {{representation}} consisting entirely of qubit <b>initialisations</b> (I), {{a network of}} controlled-NOT gates (C) and measurements with respect to different bases (M). The ICM representation is useful for optimisation of quantum circuits that include teleportation, which is required for fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. The non-deterministic nature of teleportation necessitates the conditional introduction of corrective quantum gates and additional ancillae during circuit execution. Therefore, the standard optimisation objectives, gate count and number of wires, are not well-defined for general teleportation-based circuits. The transformation of a circuit into the ICM representation provides a canonical form for an exact fault-tolerant, error corrected circuit needed for optimisation prior to the final implementation in a realistic hardware model.

40|$|Abstract. During the CRISTA- 1 mission three {{pronounced}} fingerlike structures reaching {{from the}} lower latitudes to the mid-latitudes, so-called streamers, were observed in the measurements of several trace gases in early November 1994. A simulation of these streamers in previous studies employing the KASIMA (Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere) and ROSE (Research on Ozone in the Stratosphere and its Evolution) model, both being Eulerian models, show that their formation is due to adiabatic transport processes. Here, the impact of mixing {{on the development of}} these streamers is investigated. These streamers were simulated with the CLaMS model (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere), a Lagrangian model, using N 2 O as longlived tracer. Using several different <b>initialisations</b> the results were compared to the KASIMA simulations and CRIST...|$|R

The latter organises the set of cooperating machines and interfaces into a coherent system. Machine instantiation and composition via interfaces are discussed. Machine decomposition is explored in this framework. Multi-machine refinement is described. A hypergraph project architecture is proposed. Two small case studies, on power switching and on the European Train Control System (the latter treated earlier within the single machine formalism), illustrate these mechanisms.

New constant modulus (CM) algorithms are presented that are based on soft constraint satisfaction. The stationary points of an algorithm in this family are studied for an AR(p) channel and it is shown that Ding-type undesirable local solutions (ULS) do not exist. This is due to the normalisation of the gradient vector and the soft nonlinearity used in these algorithms. Error performance surfaces (EPS) and convergence trajectories from arbitrary <b>initialisations</b> are presented for various channels that support the analytical finding...|$|R
40|$|The leading {{approach}} to fault tolerant quantum computing requires a continual supply of magic states. When a new magic state is first encoded, its initial fidelity {{will be too}} poor {{for use in the}} computation. This necessitates a resource-intensive distillation process that occupies the majority of the computer's hardware; creating magic states with a high initial fidelity minimises this cost and is therefore crucial for practical quantum computing. Here we present the surprising and encouraging result that raw magic states can have a fidelity significantly better than that of the two-qubit gate operations used to construct them. Our protocol exploits post-selection without significantly slowing the rate of generation and tolerates finite error rates in <b>initialisations,</b> measurements and single-qubit gates. This approach may dramatically reduce the size of the hardware needed for a given quantum computing task. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this report, I present my {{personal}} method {{to design a}} more accurate version of PSO, assuming we {{know what kind of}} problems we will have to solve. To illustrate the method, I consider a class of problems that are moderately multimodal and not of very high dimensionality (typically smaller than 30). The starting version is Standard PSO 2007 (SPSO 07). I use a modified velocity update equation is used, specific to the considered class of problems. Then, in order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, more general modifications are added (in particular, better <b>initialisations,</b> and the use of two kind of particles). On the whole, the resulting algorithm is indeed an improvement of SPSO 07, though the improvement is not always very impressive. In passing, I give a precise definition of "better than", and explain why the classical "mean best" performance criterion may easily be completely meaningless...|$|R
40|$|In {{real time}} systems {{controlled}} by icroprocessors, programs are often stored in ROM. The nature of ROM means that certain restrictions are made. For example self-modifying code {{is not possible}} and compile time <b>initialisations</b> of data variables are difficult since the data segment of the software {{is not included in}} the ROM code image. These reAtrictions manifest themselves in the developed software so that the programmer must at all times be conscious of the memory configuration of the destination machine. This restricts the natural and intended uGage of many High Level Languages. This paper highlights these and other problems associated with code images suitable for ROM and offers a solution to these problems which is both more efficient than the current method of dealing with executable code images in RAM as well as ROM and is easily portable to any UNIX* development environment and associated destination architecture...|$|R

However, the specification format makes {{it is difficult to}} verify that optimised or executed computations still conform to the initial gate list specifications: showing the computational equivalence between two quantum circuits expressed by different lists of quantum gates is exponentially complex in the worst case. In order to solve this issue, this work presents a derivation of the specification format tailored specifically for fault-tolerant quantum circuits. The circuits are considered a form consisting entirely of single qubit <b>initialisations,</b> CNOT gates and single qubit measurements (ICM form). This format allows, under certain assumptions, to efficiently verify optimised (or implemented) computations. Two verification methods based on checking stabiliser circuit structures are presented.
