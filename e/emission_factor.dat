30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Additional file 1 : Table S 1, all of the {{reviewed}} papers which used <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> used single, average GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> [C 10] instead of considering short-term (e.g. diurnal) <b>emissions</b> <b>factor</b> variations. The only consideration of time-dependent <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> [C 11] in the reviewed literature was by Roshani et al. (2011) (Pr 36) and Wu et al (2012 a; 2013) (Pr 48, Pr 49). In these studies, <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> were assumed to reduce annually, due to an increase in the proportion of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. However, short-term (e.g. daily) variations of <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> were not considered. Within the literature, there has been little discussion of the short-term variability of <b>emissions</b> <b>factors,</b> which considers the varying contribution of different generation types for different demand loads during the day. However, similar to electricity tariffs, <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> can vary over shorter (e.g. daily) time periods. Similar to the effect of electricity tariffs on costs (Pr 34), these changes to <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> have the potential to affect the optimal operation of pumps when considering the minimization of GHG emissions. GHG emissions are accumulated over the life-time of a WDS’s operation. As such, the time of use of electricity generated from fossil fuel sources has the potential to considerably alter the GHG emissions associated with the operation of a WDS. For WDS optimization, there lies a potential to find reduced GHG emissions operational strategies by considering the impact of time-dependent GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>factors.</b> However, this has not been studied thus far.|$|R

40|$|Poor {{regional}} {{air quality}} {{in some states}} across the US cotton belt has resulted in increased pressure on agricultural sources of particulate matter (PM) from air pollution regulators. Moreover, inaccurate <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> used in the calculation of annual emissions inventories led to the identification of cotton harvesting as {{a significant source of}} PM 10 in California and Arizona. As a result, cotton growers in these states are now required to obtain air quality permits and submit management practice plans detailing the actions taken by the producer to reduce fugitive PM emissions from field operations. The objective of this work was to develop accurate PM <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for cotton harvesting in terms of total suspended particulate (TSP), PM 10, and PM 2. 5. Two protocols were developed and used to develop PM <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> from cotton harvesting operations on three farms in Texas during 2006 and 2007. Protocol one utilized TSP concentrations measured downwind of harvesting operations with meteorological data measured onsite in a dispersion model to back-calculate TSP emission flux values. Flux values, determined with the regulatory dispersion models ISCST 3 and AERMOD, were converted to <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> and corrected with results from particle size distribution (PSD) analyses to report <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of PM 10 and PM 2. 5. <b>Emission</b> <b>factors</b> were developed for two-row (John Deere 9910) and sixrow (John Deere 9996) cotton pickers with protocol one. The uncertainty associated with the <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> developed through protocol one resulted in {{no significant difference between the}} <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for the two machines. Under the second protocol, emission concentrations were measured onboard the six-row cotton picker as the machine harvested cotton.

The total TSP, PM 10, and PM 2. 5 <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> resulting from the source measurement protocol are 1. 64 ? 0. 37, 0. 55 ? 0. 12, and 1. 58 E- 03 ? 4. 5 E- 04 kg/ha, respectively.

30|$|The {{electrical}} energy infrastructure sub-component represents {{the elements of}} electricity generation and supply infrastructure that are required to accurately evaluate pumping operational costs and GHG emissions associated with a WDS. The cost of electricity for pumping is commonly calculated by using an electricity tariff, which is represented by a tariff structure [P 4]. The tariff structure dynamics [P 7] represent the different possible tariff structures, such as flat rate or peak/off-peak rates. In order to accurately estimate the cost of pumping operational energy consumption, {{it is important to}} consider the variability in electricity tariffs during each day and/or week, as well as possible seasonal and annual variability. Pumping operational GHG emissions can be calculated by considering the generation rate and <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> of individual generators feeding into the grid. As such, both renewable [P 1] and fossil fuel (non-renewable) [P 2] generation types are represented in the conceptual framework. In order to accurately estimate the overall <b>emissions</b> <b>factor</b> [P 5] of the electricity supplied to the WDS, the amalgamation of all individual generators supplying into the grid, represented as the electrical source [P 3], should be considered. The use of <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> is represented by the <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> dynamics [P 8]. <b>Emissions</b> <b>factors</b> can range from the use of a single, average value, to the use of multiple <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> used to represent the change in emission intensities over the period of a day, between each month/season in a year, or between each year over the operational life-span of the WDS. As a WDS is just one of many users consuming electricity from a grid, careful consideration should be given to how <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> associated with the consumption of electricity by the WDS [P 5] are calculated (e.g. whether <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> values consider all generated electricity, or only the generation of electricity used by the WDS). While the consideration of how <b>emissions</b> <b>factor</b> values are calculated is beyond the scope of this paper, the application of the <b>emissions</b> <b>factor</b> values must also be carefully considered.

5000|$|If the {{temperature}} in the building is higher than {{the temperature}} outside, the heat leaks through the elements of construction. Windows are usually the most vulnerable elements of the building in terms of heat losses. The heat loss though window constructions is about 20-25% of total heat loss. Heat insulation of translucent constructions can be improved by increasing the number of glasses and chambers of multiple glass panes, but will result in increased construction cost and decreased optical transmission. The reasonable alternative is the usage of low-emissivity glass, which is practically the same as ordinary glass in terms of optical transmission, but it also reflects the heat radiation back into the room. The major indicator which characterizes the ability of glass to reflect heat radiation is its emissivity (E) or the [...] "emission factor". The <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of ordinary glass is 0.83; the factor for low-emissive glass can reach 0.03, so that more than 90% of accumulated heat will be reflected back into the room. The lower the <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> is, the more effective is the material to reflect the heat, and the more heat it will accumulate. To compare, the <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of a multiple glass pane with two chambers, which is made of ordinary glass, {{is the same as the}} <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of a multiple glass pane with one chamber, which was produced with usage of low-emissive glass. Besides energy-efficient functions in cold seasons of the year, low-emissive glass possesses the ability to reflect the excess of outside heat energy in summer seasons; the optical transmission coefficient is affected insignificantly in this way. The additional factor of reduce of heat transfer of multiple glass panes is the usage of low thermal conductivity gases - Ar or Kr - to fill the chambers. In present-day multiple glass panes Ar is more often used, which helps to reduce heat losses by 10-20%, though the cost of multiple glass panes is insignificantly increased.|$|E
