40|$|Purpose: A {{system to}} measure the {{visibility}} of agricultural tractor operators was designed and evaluated according to ISO standards, and a blind area diagram around the tested tractor was created based on the manual method recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Methods: A visibility measurement system was designed and evaluated based on the ISO 5006 and ISO 5721 - 1 standards. Two bulbs used to simulate the operator's eyes were mounted on a bar with a supporting frame. A wooden frame {{was used to determine}} the seat index point position. The 12 -m visibility test circle was divided into six sectors of vision, and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, <b>front</b> <b>visibility</b> was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the semi-circle of vision to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the semi-circle of vision. A blind area diagram was created to define the exact nature of the blind spots and mirror visibility. Conclusions: Visibility evaluation is an effective way to enable proper and safe operation for agricultural tractor operators. Inclusion of this visibility evaluation test in the general testing process might aid tracto...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{assessment}} of short time step precipitation is a challenging task. Low density of observation networks, {{as well as}} the bias in radar rainfall estimation motivated the new idea of exploiting cars as moving rain gauges with windshield wipers or optical sensors as measurement devices. In a preliminary study, this idea has been tested with computer experiments (Haberlandt and Sester, 2010). The results have shown that a high number of possibly inaccurate measurement devices (moving cars) provide more reliable areal rainfall estimations than a lower number of precise measurement devices (stationary gauges). Instead of assuming a relationship between wiper frequency (W) and rainfall intensity (R) with an arbitrary error, the main objective {{of this study is to}} derive valid W – R relationships between sensor readings and rainfall intensity by laboratory experiments. Sensor readings involve the wiper speed, as well as optical sensors which can be placed on cars and are usually made for automating wiper activities. A rain simulator with the capability of producing a wide range of rainfall intensities is designed and constructed. The wiper speed and two optical sensors are used in the laboratory to measure rainfall intensities, and compare it with tipping bucket readings as reference. Furthermore, the effect of the car speed on the estimation of rainfall using a car speed simulator device is investigated. The results show that the sensor readings, which are observed from wiper speed adjustment according to the <b>front</b> <b>visibility,</b> can be considered as a strong indicator for rainfall intensity. Also the optical sensors showed promising results toward measuring rainfall rate. It is observed that the car speed has a significant effect on the rainfall measurement. This effect is highly dependent on the rain type {{as well as the}} windshield angle...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Inter-City 125" [...] livery {{was blue}} and grey, {{with a yellow}} <b>front</b> to improve <b>visibility</b> which continued {{down the side of}} the power cars. This was the livery recorded in British Rail's corporate identity manual of August 1977.|$|R
50|$|Frontal snowsqualls are {{associated}} with a fast moving intense cold <b>front</b> in winter. <b>Visibilities</b> must be reduce to less than 500 m, wind over 40 km/h with a wind shift. Quantities of snow is not important with this type but intensity is heavy for a short period, typically 10 to 20 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the <b>Front</b> had {{significant}} <b>visibility</b> {{because of its}} numerous public actions that almost always ended in clashes with police and KGB. It was BPF parliamentarians who convinced the Supreme Soviet (the interim Belarusian parliament) to restore the historical Belarusian symbols: the white-red-white flag and the Pahonia coat of arms. During Soviet-times people faced arrest in the streets for displaying white-red-white symbols in Belarus.|$|R
50|$|The Aeronca Model 50 Chief was an American light {{plane of}} the late 1930s. Consumer demand for more comfort, longer range and better {{instrumentation}} resulted in its development in 1938, powered by a 50-horsepower (37-kilowatt) Continental, Franklin or Lycoming engine. A 65-horsepower (48-kilowatt) Continental engine powered the Model 65 Super Chief, which was also built in a flight trainer version, the Model TC-65 Defender, with its rear seat positioned nine inches (23 centimeters) higher than the <b>front</b> for better <b>visibility.</b>|$|R
25|$|In early September, {{optimism}} increased among German commanders {{that the}} Flanders offensive had been defeated and several divisions and air units were transferred elsewhere. Drier weather and extensive road repairs {{made it much}} easier for the British to move vast amounts of supplies forward from the original <b>front</b> line. <b>Visibility</b> increased except for frequent ground fog around dawn, which helped conceal British infantry during the attack, before clearing to expose German troop movements to British observation and attack. The British infantry succeeded in capturing most of their objectives and then holding them against German counter-attacks, inflicting many casualties on the local German defenders and Eingreifdivisionen sent to reinforce them by massed artillery and small-arms fire. German defences on the Gheluvelt Plateau, which had been retained or quickly recaptured in July and August were lost and the British began a run of success which lasted into early October.|$|R
50|$|The Partyja BPF (Belarusian Popular Front) was {{established}} in 1988 as a political party and cultural movement for democracy and independence, à la the Baltic republics’ popular fronts. The discovery of mass graves in Kurapaty outside Minsk by historian Zianon Pazniak, the Belarusian Popular Front’s first leader, gave additional momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus. It claimed that the NKVD performed secret killings in Kurapaty. Initially the <b>Front</b> had significant <b>visibility</b> because its numerous public actions almost always ended in clashes with {{the police and the}} KGB.|$|R
5000|$|A thesis {{work done}} by {{students}} of the Institute of Design (ISDI in Spanish), shows that in that year and the following:"The body text typeface had no formal or conceptual basis, as their selection was subject to the availability of types in the workshop, for holders was the Futura. The pictures are rounded vertices."The structure of the <b>front</b> favored their <b>visibility</b> on the streets, because the photos were the top stories on {{the top half of}} the newspaper, was generally organized, yet traditional, and the information was in good ranking." ...|$|R
50|$|When first {{built the}} 55s and 75s worked on country lines around South Australia up until their {{withdrawal}} from service and featured a brown livery. To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the SAR in 1936, all Model 55s and 75s still in service were given a repaint into a green and cream livery-which they wore until retirement. Later on yellow stripes {{were added to the}} <b>front</b> to increase <b>visibility.</b> The 55s were built for operation on the broad gauge network, although two (4 and 10) did operate on the narrow gauge for a time, being renumbered 112 and 111.|$|R
50|$|They were {{delivered}} in two tones of green. Later yellow safety bands were added across their <b>fronts</b> to increase <b>visibility.</b> This got replaced by all-over green with silver stripes as on later locomotives. The original numbering was 120.001, 120.002 and 120.003. In 1971 {{they became the}} original Class 20, numbered 2001, 2002 and 2003. When the order for the new six axle 7000 HP Class 20 was placed with BN in late in 1973, these three locos became 2801, 2802 and 2803. All three were painted blue some time after they became Class 28. They were and still are very popular with Belgian railfans.|$|R
50|$|A {{key feature}} driving {{the use of}} the tall body design was the upward {{movement}} of the H-point (hip point). As with the first-generation Ford Focus, the seats of the Five Hundred were positioned relatively high from the floor, providing an upright seating position and improved visibility, access, and egress. In addition, the rear seat was positioned higher than the <b>front</b> seats. While <b>visibility</b> was one factor behind the higher seating position, safety was another as well. Under the front seats, a hydroformed cross-car steel beam is welded in between the B-pillars (directly below an identical beam above the B-pillars), designed as part of a side-impact safety design derived from Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) from Volvo.|$|R
5000|$|The EMD GP7 is a four-axle (B-B) road {{switcher}} diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division and General Motors Diesel between October, 1949 and May 1954. Power {{was provided by}} an EMD 567B 16-cylinder engine which generated [...] [...] The GP7 was offered both with and without control cabs, and those built without control cabs were called a GP7B. Five GP7B's were built between March and April 1953. The GP7 was the first EMD road locomotive to use a hood unit design instead of a car-body design. This {{proved to be more}} efficient than the car body design as the hood unit cost less to build, was cheaper and easier to maintain, and had much better <b>front</b> and rear <b>visibility</b> for switching.|$|R
500|$|On 1 September 1918, Towner was {{in command}} of No.3 Section of the 7th Machine Gun Company during an attack on Mont St. Quentin, near Péronne. Armed with four Vickers machine guns, the section was {{attached}} to the right flank of the 24th Australian Infantry Battalion, whose principal objective was to seize the summit of Mont St. Quentin. To accomplish this, the battalion would have to advance through the village of Feuillaucourt before moving down to the Péronne road. The Australians began their advance at 06:00 behind an artillery screen, with Towner's section covering a <b>front</b> of [...] <b>Visibility</b> was limited by rain, and Australian casualties soon began to mount. Locating a German machine gun that was causing heavy losses among the advancing troops, Towner rushed the position and single-handedly killed the crew with his revolver. Having captured the gun, he then turned it on the Germans.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} the class has carried six {{different}} liveries. When introduced they were painted an all-over silver livery which unfortunately dirtied quickly and {{was not a good}} advert for dieselisation. This was followed by all-over CIE green livery with a thin lighter green band on the lower panels, giving a uniform appearance to the train sets. In the next change black became the base colour with just a white relief around the top panel, which opened to a squared-off 'V' between the cab windows. Some locomotives received large yellow panel to the cab <b>fronts</b> to aid <b>visibility.</b> With the adaptation by CIE of its [...] "Black and Tan" [...] scheme in the mid-1960s, the locomotives received this livery with a white line at roof level to match the coaches. The last CIE livery was of Golden Brown with a very broad black band covering the upper panels at the level of, and as wide as, the cab windows.Those locomotives sold to NIR carried their blue livery.|$|R
50|$|The (riveted) armour of all {{vertical}} plates was 13 mm, of all inclined plates 9 mm, {{of the top}} 6 mm and of {{the bottom}} 5 mm. There was a crew of two: the driver to the left next to the engine and the tank commander/gunner behind him in the turret which was armed with a 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun. There was also a reserve machine gun that could be optionally placed on a pedestal {{on top of the}} turret for defence against aircraft. The original proposal had foreseen the use of a special expensive Schneider turret; the prototypes had a very high octagonal Renault turret at the very back of the hull. This proved to be too awkward and was replaced on the series vehicles by a flatter design from the army Atelier de Vincennes, the AVIS-1, which was moved about a foot to the <b>front</b> to improve <b>visibility.</b> The AVIS was produced by Renault and had, unusually for a French tank turret of the thirties, a hatch in the top for observation. The normal access to the tank was by means of large double hatch {{at the back of the}} hull.|$|R
50|$|The E.626 {{series was}} built in 448 units and three series, each with only slight electro-mechanic differences: unadvanced but reliable, it {{subsequently}} constituted the mainstay of the new FS lines at 3,000 V DC, which gradually spread to the whole peninsula. The firsts tests occurred on the Foggia-Benevento line in the September 1927, using three prototypes built at Savigliano, with the electric part provided by the Metropolitan-Vickers of Manchester. The first 14 prototypes (eight E.625 with shorter gear ratio, for cargo services, and six E.626) proved powerful and reliable, and entered service the following year. The only teething problem encountered was with the six 32R motors mounting on the axles, hanging laterally over transverse beams, a system devised to avoid the complicate side rods of the contemporary steam and three-phase locomotives: {{after a series of}} breakdowns, it was decided to limit the speed to 95 km/h. Traction control was provided by three different configurations of the motors' coupling (series, series-parallel, parallel) through banks of resistor-based rheostats. The transmission was rather noisy, but at the time the crew's comfort was not an important issue. The carbody was in a single steel piece, mounting on an articulated chassis. The large bonnets at the <b>front</b> limited the <b>visibility</b> of the rails, and were reduced in size from the 3rd series.|$|R
40|$|Ranges of manyspecies are {{shifting}} polewards {{in response to}} contemporary global warming. Rangeshifting species experience different selective forces at the expansion frontcompared with these experienced {{at the core of}} their range and this can havelarge impacts on the evolution of phenotypic traits at the expansion front. Determining changes in phenotypic traits during range expansion is important aschanges in traits may influence the rate of further range expansion, abioticinteractions and biotic interactions at the expansion front. Inthis thesis I combined field studies, indoor common garden experiments andoutdoor mesocosm experiments to obtain a multivariate picture on the traitdifferentiation and associated changes in (a) biotic interactions during thepoleward range expansion of the damselfly Coenagrionscitulum. Phenotypicdifferentiation associated with northward range expansion Two importantaspects may induce evolution in phenotypic traits during range expansion. Firstly, populations at the expansion front are assorted by dispersal ability,whereby only the best dispersers colonize the expansion front. Secondly,population densities in newly founded populations at the expansion front arelow which may change selection regimes for life-history traits. Besides effectsof the range expansion process per se, also geographically structured thermalregimes may contribute to changes in phenotypic traits during range expansion. Geographicallystructured thermal regimes in both the larval (length of the growth season) andadult stage (adult flight period temperature) had an impact on different traitsinvestigated. Yet, importantly, these temperature regimes had only a smallcontribution to the phenotypic differentiation between core and edgepopulations. I documented in different studies changes in flight-related traitsthat indicate a better flight ability at the expansion front. I found higherinvestment in flight muscle mass, a lower wing loading and a larger relativethorax length at the range expansion front of C. scitulum. Higher flight ability at the expansion front mayevolve through natural selection whereby individuals that disperse most rapidlyat the expansion front benefit from the low densities of conspecifics at therange edge, and through spatial sorting in dispersal ability. Linked to theevolution of higher dispersal ability, adults at the expansion front had ahigher immune response (encapsulation response). Selection for a highinvestment in immune function to lower parasite load may occur through anegative effect of high parasite load on dispersal ability. Theory predictsselection for a higher population growth rate at the expansion front, which isfavoured at the low population densities in newly colonized habitats. At theexpansion front of C. scitulum Idocumented faster larval growth and development, while fecundity did not differbetween core and edge females. I documented for the first time, an increase ofactivity level in the non-dispersive larval stage at the expansion front; whileno higher activity in adults at the expansion front was detected. My resultsindicated that the higher larval activity at the expansion front evolved tomeet a higher energy demand in edge populations that is allocated to fastergrowth and higher investment in flight-related traits at the expansion front. Abiotic andbiotic interactions at the expansion frontLow foodconditions and high competition had a negative effect on growth rate of larvae;additionally low food conditions in the larval stage decreased investment inflight muscle mass hence likely dispersal ability. Furthermore, my results suggesta higher susceptibility of edge larvae to food limitation, which highlights theimportance of optimal local conditions at the expansion front for animalfitness and further range expansion. In contrast, winter survival was nothigher in edge larvae, indicating that no thermal adaptation for enhancedwinter survival at the expansion front occurred. Thehigher investment in dispersal, faster life history and higher larval activitywas expected to influence biotic interactions at the expansion front. Higherlarval activity and growth at the expansion <b>front</b> may increase <b>visibility</b> tovisual predators, hence was expected to increase predation risk by Anax imperator larvae. Furthermore,given that higher activity and growth rates typically are associated with abetter competitive ability, we predicted larvae at the expansion front to besuperior competitors relative to larvae from core populations. In contrast tothese expectations, we did not find a difference in predator-prey interactionsnor larval competitive ability between core and edge larvae. The relativelysmall changes in larval growth and activity during the range expansion of C. scitulum may be too small to have aprofound impact on the studied biotic interactions. Sexual selection for higherflight duration of males was consistent in core and edge populations. Incontrast, I detected geographical patterns in sexual selection for male bodysize and fat content, however these geographical patterns were rather shaped bydifferences in thermal regimes than by processes associated with rangeexpansion per se. My study not only adds to thegrowing number of studies that document rapid evolutionary changes in dispersaland life-history during range expansion, but also contributes to the scarcestudies investigating abiotic and biotic interactions at the expansion front. Furthermore, my study is the first to document the evolution of a higher adultimmune response and a higher activity level in the non-dispersive larval stageat the expansion front, which may give rise to eco-evolutionary dynamics.
