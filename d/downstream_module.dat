40|$|Synthetic biology has intensively {{promoted}} the technical implementation of modular {{strategies in the}} fabrication of biological devices. There, modules are considered as networks of reactions. The behavior displayed by biomolecular systems results from the information processes {{carried out by the}} interconnection of the involved modules. However, in natural systems, module wiring is not a free-of-charge process; as a consequence of interconnection a reactive phenomenon called retroactivity emerges. This phenomenon is characterized by signals that propagate from <b>downstream</b> <b>modules</b> (the modules that receive the incoming signals upon interconnection) to upstream ones (the modules that send the signals upon interconnection). Such retroactivity signals, depending of their strength, may change and sometimes even disrupt the behavior of modular biomolecular systems. Thus, analysis of retroactivity effects in natural biological and biosynthetic systems is crucial to achieve a deeper understanding of how this interconnection between functionally characterized modules takes place and how it impacts the overall behavior of the involved cell. By discussing the modules interconnection in natural and synthetic biomolecular systems, we propose that such systems should be considered as quasi-modular...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the number}} of {{synthetic}} genetic modules grows, the issue of reliably predicting their behavior upon intercon-nection becomes more pressing. The trajectory of an upstream module changes once connected to a <b>downstream</b> <b>module</b> due to retroactivity. Here, we employ dissipativity analysis to provide an upper bound on the L 2 measure of this difference. To obtain this upper bound we formulate a Sum of Squares (SOS) optimization problem which we then solve using semi-definite programming. One particular strength {{of this approach is}} the ability to successfully handle parameter uncertainties while providing guaranteed upper bounds on the difference between the trajectories.

40|$|AbstractSynthetic gene {{regulatory}} networks show significant stochastic {{fluctuations in}} expression levels {{due to the}} low copy number of transcription factors. When a synthetic gene network is allowed to regulate a downstream network, the response time of the regulating transcription factors increases. This effect has been termed “retroactivity”. In this article, we describe a method for estimating the retroactivity of a given system by measuring the stochastic noise in the transcription factor expression. We show that the noise in the output signal of the network can be affected significantly when the output is connected to a <b>downstream</b> <b>module.</b> More specifically, the output signal noise can show significantly longer correlations. We define retroactivity by {{the change in the}} correlation time. This measure of retroactivity corresponds well to the deterministic retroactivity described in another study. We provide an estimation method for measuring retroactivity from the gene expression noise by investigating its autocorrelation function. When retroactivity is defined using the decay (correlation) times from the gene expression autocorrelation functions, it is found not to depend on whether the module output is defined as either the free transcription factor or the total of the bound and free transcription factor. The frequency domain response, however, depends strongly on which output variable is considered. The proposed estimation method for measuring retroactivity, based on the gene expression noise, can serve as a practical method for characterizing interface conditions between two synthetic modules and eventually provide a step toward large-scale circuit design for synthetic biology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Polyketides are {{structurally}} diverse {{natural products}} {{that have a}} range of medically useful activities. Nonaromatic bacterial polyketides are synthesised on modular polyketide synthase (PKS) multienzymes, in which each cycle of chain extension requires a different ‘module’ of enzymatic activities. Attempts to design and construct modular PKSs that synthesise specified novel polyketides provide a particularly stringent test of our understanding of PKS structure and function. Results: We have constructed bimodular and trimodular PKSs based on DEBS 1 -TE, a derivative of the erythromycin PKS that contains only modules 1 and 2 and a thioesterase (TE), by substituting multiple domains with appropriate counterparts derived from the rapamycin PKS. Hybrid PKSs were obtained that synthesised the predicted target triketide lactones, which are simple analogues of cholesterol-lowering statins. In constructing intermodular fusions, whether between modules in the same or in different proteins, it was found advantageous to preserve intact the acyl carrier protein-ketosynthase (ACP-KS) didomain that spans the junction between successive modules. Conclusions: Relatively simple considerations govern the construction of functional hybrid PKSs. Fusion sites should be chosen either in the surface-accessible linker regions between enzymatic domains, as previously revealed, or just inside the conserved margins of domains. The interaction of an ACP domain with the adjacent KS domain, whether on the same polyketide or not, is of particular importance, both through conservation of appropriate protein-protein interactions, and through optimising molecular recognition of the altered polyketide chain in the key transfer of the acyl chain from the ACP of one module to the KS of the <b>downstream</b> <b>module...</b>|$|E

RPTk is an ongoing development effort intended to provide users with an extensible, integrated, and scalable software framework for the modeling and simulation of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plants by enabling the insertion and coupling of user-developed physicochemical modules of variable fidelity. The NEAMS Safeguards and Separations IPSC (SafeSeps) and the Enabling Computational Technologies (ECT) supporting program element have partnered to release an initial version of the RPTk with a focus on software usability and utility. RPTk implements a data flow architecture that is the source of the system's extensibility and scalability. Data flows through physicochemical modules sequentially, with each module importing data, evolving it, and exporting the updated data to the next <b>downstream</b> <b>module.</b> This is accomplished through various architectural abstractions designed to give RPTk true plug-and-play capabilities. A simple application of this architecture, as well as RPTk data flow and evolution, is demonstrated in Section 6 with an application consisting of two coupled physicochemical modules.

The synthases producing the unusual nitro-substituted polyketides neoaureothin (nor, also called spectinabilin) and aureothin (aur) are exceptional, as they employ individual modules iteratively. Here, we investigate the plasticity of the nor PKS and the factors governing the number of elongations catalyzed by the noncanonical module. Surprisingly, we observe that the nor PKS can mediate an additional chain elongation to yield the higher homolog homoneoaureothin. Furthermore, we design several truncated variants of the nor PKS to use them {{in the context of}} artificial assembly lines for aureothin and homoaureothin. The resulting polypropionate derivatives provide valuable insights into chain length control and reveal structure-activity relationships relating {{to the size of the}} polypropionate backbones.

We previously found that two basic loop-helix-loop transcription factors, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF 4) and PIF 5, integrate light and circadian clock signaling to generate rhythmic plant growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we use expression profiling and real-time growth assays to identify growth regulatory networks downstream of PIF 4 and PIF 5. Genome-wide analysis of light-, clock-, or growth-correlated genes showed significant overlap between the transcriptomes of clock-, light-, and growth-related pathways. Overrepresentation analysis of growth-correlated genes predicted that the auxin and gibberellic acid (GA) hormone pathways both contribute to diurnal growth control. Indeed, lesions of GA biosynthesis genes retarded rhythmic growth. Surprisingly, GA-responsive genes are not enriched among genes regulated by PIF 4 and PIF 5, whereas auxin pathway and response genes are. Consistent with this finding, the auxin response is more severely affected than the GA response in pif 4 pif 5 double mutants and in PIF 5 -overexpressing lines.

However, the circuit mechanisms that mediate and link perception of salient stimuli to execution of an adaptive response are poorly understood. We combined a virtual hunting assay for tethered larval zebrafish with two-photon functional calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neuronal activity in the optic tectum during naturalistic behavior. Hunting responses showed mixed selectivity for combinations of visual features, specifically stimulus size, speed, and contrast polarity. We identified a subset of tectal neurons with similar highly selective tuning, which show non-linear mixed selectivity for visual features and are likely to mediate the perceptual recognition of prey. By comparing neural dynamics in the optic tectum during response versus non-response trials, we discovered premotor population activity that specifically preceded initiation of hunting behavior and exhibited anatomical localization that correlated with motor variables. In summary, the optic tectum contains non-linear mixed selectivity neurons that are likely to mediate reliable detection of ethologically relevant sensory stimuli. Recruitment of small tectal assemblies appears to link perception to action by providing the premotor commands that release hunting responses.

Efficient recycling of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) requires a C-terminal PDZ (PSD- 95 /Discs Large/ZO- 1) protein-binding determinant (PDZbd), an intact actin cytoskeleton, and is regulated by the endosomal protein Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate). The PDZbd is thought to link receptors to actin {{through a series of}} protein interaction modules present in NHERF/EBP 50 (Na+/H+ exchanger 3 regulatory factor/ezrin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) family and ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins. It is not known, however, if such actin connectivity is sufficient to recapitulate the natural features of sequence-dependent recycling. We addressed this question using a receptor fusion approach based on the sufficiency of the PDZbd to promote recycling when fused to a distinct GPCR, the δ-opioid receptor, which normally recycles inefficiently in HEK 293 cells. Modular domains mediating actin connectivity promoted receptor recycling with similarly high efficiency as the PDZbd itself, and recycling promoted by all of the domains was actin-dependent. Regulation of receptor recycling by Hrs, however, was conferred only by the PDZbd and not by <b>downstream</b> interaction <b>modules.</b> These results suggest that actin connectivity is sufficient to mimic the core recycling activity of a GPCR-linked PDZbd but not its cellular regulation...|$|R
