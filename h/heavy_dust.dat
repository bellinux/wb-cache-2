25|$|On April 27, the Mahdi Army {{once again}} took {{advantage}} of a <b>heavy</b> <b>dust</b> storm which grounded US aerial forces to attack the blockades around Sadr City. 22 Mahdi army militiamen were killed when they attacked a joint US-Iraqi checkpoint. The checkpoint was supported by M1A2 Abrams tanks and no US or Iraqi forces were injured during the attack. 16 militants were also killed in separate engagements throughout eastern Baghdad, according to a US military statement. The next day three American soldiers were killed by rocket and mortar attacks in eastern Baghdad. Another US soldier {{was killed in a}} similar attack in northern Baghdad. On the same day seven militants were killed by US tank and helicopter fire in Sadr city. In total four U.S. soldiers, 45 militants and eight civilians were killed during the 24 hours of fighting.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, a <b>heavy</b> <b>dust</b> storm engulfed Baghdad and the militiamen {{used this}} to their advantage, attacking the {{coalition}} front lines {{under the cover}} of the storm. Militiamen attacked an Iraqi police station which had American advisors embedded with the Iraqis, fearing a repeat of Tuesday's desertions. As fighting grew and US forces prepared to send tanks and APCs to support the Iraqis, an Iraqi armored force arrived at the station before US forces were needed. Fighting continued throughout the night and new attacks were staged the next day as the storm continued and U.S. forces were not able to send in helicopters, planes or drones to assist. This day another company of Iraqi soldiers deserted their post after almost being overrun by militants. The fighting finally died down in the evening as the sand storm lifted. In the fighting on April 17 and 18, 17 Iraqi soldiers and 22 militiamen were killed along with a number of civilians.|$|E

2500|$|The interurban, {{especially}} in the United States, in the early 1900s was a valuable cultural institution.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{describes}} trials {{carried out}} at three collieries to compare the per-formance of the Hexhlet sampler (both in its standard form with a nominal sampling rate of 100 I/min and in modified forms, with the same theoretical elutriator charac-teristics, with nominal sampling rates of 73 and 49 l/min), the Conicycle (both in its standard form with a sampling rate of 10 l/min and in a modified form with a sampling rate of 8 l/min), the Standard Thermal Precipitator and the Long Running Thermal Precipitator. In all, replicate samples were obtained with {{some or all of}} the various instruments on 102 shifts. The main conclusions of the experiments are as follows: (a) The 1001 /min Hexhlet tended to "oversample " the "respirable " dust in compari-son with the 73 ljmin Hexhlet and the latter tended to oversample in comparison with the 49 I/min Hexhlet in the coarse dust clouds prevailing at one of the three collieries. This apparent excess of respirable (thimble) dust was balanced almost exactly by a corresponding deficiency of the <b>heavier</b> <b>dust</b> retained in the elutriator. In the less coarse dusts at the other collieries, however, there was no consistent difference between the three versions of the Hexhlet...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{deposition}} {{patterns of}} inhaled wood dust in an anatomically accurate nasal cavity were investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) techniques. Three wood <b>dusts,</b> pine <b>dust,</b> <b>heavy</b> oak <b>dust,</b> and light oak dust, with a particle size distribution generated by machining (Chung et al., 2000), were simulated at an inhalation flow rate of 10 L/min. It {{was found that the}} major particle deposition sites were the nasal valve region and anterior section of the middle turbinate. Wood dust depositing in these regions is physiologically removed much more slowly than in other regions. This leads to the surrounding layer of soft tissues being damaged by the deposited particles during continuous exposure to wood dust. Additionally, it was found that pine dust had a higher deposition efficiency in the nasal cavity than the two oak dusts, {{due to the fact that}} it comprises a higher proportion of larger sized particles. Therefore, this indicates that dusts with a large amount of fine particles, such as those generated by sanding, may penetrate the nasal cavity and travel further into the lung...|$|R
