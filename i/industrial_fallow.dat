40|$|Modern Societies have to {{consider}} diverse tasks strongly related to geochemistry sciences. Examples intensively discussed in the public are restoration measures for contaminated <b>industrial</b> <b>fallow</b> grounds, the safe storage of chemical-toxic and radioactive waste, carbon dioxide sequestration to reduce green-house gas emissions, the construction and operation of deep geothermal power plants, the geochemical exploration of natural resources or water and waste water treatments, including desalination efforts. Direct and urgent aspects {{to be dealt with}} are analytical and geochemical consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. All these cases have one in common – they require reliable thermodynamic data in order to forecast the fate of chemicals in the respective environment. Whereas a variety of standard methods, such as potentiometry, solubility studies, liquid-liquid extraction or electrochemical titrations, are in widespread use to generate thermodynamic data, it is far less straightforward to assign correct reaction pathways and structural patterns to the underlying chemical transformations. This especially holds for systems with strong tendencies to complexation and oligomerization. Here, it is essential to have proof of evidence for all involved species, which cannot be provided by the aforementioned methods, and is still lacking for various metal-containing systems. Spectroscopic techniques in combination with approaches from quantum chemistry can be of great benefit for such tasks. However, their application ranges are often restricted with respect to the type of element (and redox state) that can be probed. Further handicaps are imposed by detection limits or other parameters such as pH or salinity. Moreover, the spectroscopic results are often difficult to interpret in an unambiguous way. To overcome these complications at least partially, this workshop has been initiated. It shall significantly extend the application areas of spectroscopic tools important for lanthanide and actinide chemistry. Emphasis shall be placed on the development of spectroscopic methods towards more challenging environmental conditions – such as very basic pH values, elevated temperatures, pressures, or salinities – extending the range of covered elements and redox states. Furthermore, the exploration of options for lowering detection limits and increasing spatial resolution at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios will support future investigations on more complex systems. An approach combining the extension of spectroscopic tools with respect to elements and parameters, improvements of experimental setups, and applications of quantum chemical methods in predictive as well as interpretative ways certainly can be very beneficial. The workshop hopefully will bundle and strengthen respective research activities and ideally act as a nucleus for an international network, closely collaborating with international partners. I am confident that the workshop will deliver many exciting ideas, promote scientific discussions, stimulate new developments and in such a way be successful...|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} of transformation {{resulting from the}} pressure {{to adapt to the}} level of western and international markets has led to the loss of traditional economic bases and jobs in eastern German big cities, especially in the secondary sector. A process linked with this is the fact that trade and <b>industrial</b> <b>fallows</b> have come into being. What was first of all characteristic for the formation of the service society was the development outwards to suburbanisation {{and the fact that the}} city has lost its function. At the present, the development inwards, meaning opening up possibilities through renewing and refunctionalising areas, is becoming more and more important in the framework of sustained urban development. The mixed areas that are in the area of the city centre and that are developed in the architectural style of the period of promoterism are under special pressure to either undergo change or be crowded out. Because of the attractive historical buildings and the favourable location in relation to the city centre, they are especially affected by {{processes of}} gentrification and assume the functions of areas for service organisations to expand from the city centre. We would like to take the example of a mixed area in the City of Leipzig to investigate in greater detail the process of deterioration of traditional structures, their persistence as well as introducing new economic, social and cultural functions. This area bordering immediately on the eastern side of the city centre bears the designation of the Graphic District because it was once concentrated in one space and the fact that the paper, publishing and printing trade dominated here. In the first portion, we will present a historical and geographic analysis of the development of the utility structure in various important time periods. Based upon this, we will take stock of the present mixed structures in the second portion and make an analysis of the location with the aid of utilisation mapping and a standardised oral survey of entrepreneurs. The freedom of movement to be found in the Graphic District, the larger <b>industrial</b> <b>fallows</b> as well as residential and commercial buildings from the period of promoterism that still exist there from the end of the 19 th and the beginning of the 20 th century offer sufficient space for the development of an expanding service sector in the city with its office space needs. It is already one of the main locations of Leipzig's large office complexes that have come about partially as a result of new buildings being built and partially as a result of reconstructing historical buildings. Residential buildings are also being built to a great extent and flats renovated at a high standard in the city centre. Since the Graphic District was not especially promoted either as a select commercial area or as a "model area" of the city, it has primarily been groups of private economic protagonists who have had an essential influence upon its development. We can also observe a varying process of occupying office space over a staggered period of time, whereby the amount of empty space is somewhat high. Furthermore, enterpriseorientated service suppliers utilise the benefits of this location, the fact that it is favourable to traffic and the historical or newly formed image of the district. In conclusion, we will make a critical evaluation of the Graphic District location from our studies as an office and business site for individual sectors from the point of view of the group of protagonists from commercial, trade and service suppliers and view for the future development...|$|R
