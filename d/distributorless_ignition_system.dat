2500|$|Six-cylinder X300s are {{powered by}} the AJ16 inline-six engine, which is a further {{enhancement}} of the AJ6 engine that uses an electronic <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> The V12 remained available {{until the end of}} the X300 production in 1997 (although it ended one year earlier in the United States market due to problems meeting OBD-II-related emissions requirements.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1987 saw {{changes to}} the front and rear fascias on the [...] "base coupe" [...] with the SE and GT models keeping the same [...] "Aero" [...] nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black bumper pads of the earlier models and had a {{smoother}} look. The four-cylinder engine's power rating increased to [...] with some major modifications which included a roller cam, redesigned intake manifold, <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> (DIS), open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. Bright Blue (M21) and Medium Red Metallic (M77) were added and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT. Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade {{in the form of an}} [...] "option" [...] that changed the original body to a Pininfarina Ferrari 308-type body, called the Fiero Mera. Corporate Concepts completed the [...] "Mera" [...] transformation and none were sold as kit form. The Mera body change was offered only on new Fieros, sold through Pontiac dealers and is considered a class of car in its own right. Only 247 Mera's were produced by Corporate Concepts before production was halted when sued by Ferrari. With its limited number produced, the Pontiac Mera is one of the rarest American made automobiles.|$|E
50|$|The Ford EDIS or Electronic <b>Distributorless</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>System</b> is a {{computer-controlled}} {{ignition system}} developed by Ford that uses an ignition coil for {{each pair of}} cylinders (wasted spark). All the coils are placed in a single module called a coilpack.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} stroked to 78.5 mm in 1992 for a {{displacement}} of 6.0 L (5993 cc)(365.7 ci) {{to make this}} {{one of the most powerful}} Jaguar production engines to date at [...] The 6.0-litre engine on X305 used a new Nippondenso <b>distributorless</b> crank-fired <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> with coil packs very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The last Jaguar V12 engine was produced on April 17, 1997.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, the 4-cylinder {{engine was}} the all new K-series. For {{the first time}} the 4-cylinder Accord gained a direct <b>ignition</b> (<b>distributorless)</b> coil-on-plug <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> which had {{previously}} been introduced on the V6. The direct <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> provides a slight horsepower and fuel economy gain, as well as improved long-term reliability, relative to the traditional system with a distributor and spark plug wires. In addition, Honda provided a new recommendation for engine oil viscosity, 5W-20 instead of the previous 5W-30 viscosity. Because of the lower viscosity, engine parts move with less friction, which increases fuel economy. Together with other improvements, this change effected an increase from the previous generation's (with VTEC 4-cylinder F23A1 engine and the manual transmission) 22mpg city/29 hwy rating, to 23mpg city/31 hwy, according to 2008 EPA ratings. The 4-cylinder engine could be mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or to a 5-speed automatic transmission with overdrive (also new for 2003). A specific 4-cylinder model was the first production car in the world to meet California's Super Ultra Low Emissions standards.|$|R
5000|$|A {{turbocharged}} {{version was}} introduced as the pace {{car at the}} 1976 Indianapolis 500, and a production turbo arrived in 1978. The turbo 3.8 received sequential fuel injection and a <b>distributorless</b> wasted spark <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> in 1984. In 1986 an air-to-air Garrett intercooler was added and the RPO Code became LC2. The LC2 engine has a bore of 3.80" [...] and a stroke of 3.40". The respective horsepower ratings for 1986 & 1987 were 235 hp (175 kW) & 245 hp (183 kW). The limited production GNX benefitted from additional factory modifications such as a ceramic turbocharger, more efficient Garrett intercooler, low restriction exhaust system and revised programming {{which resulted in a}} 276 hp (206 kW) factory rating.|$|R
50|$|In {{its last}} version before {{production}} ended, the C20XE {{came with a}} new engine management system which included a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> namely Bosch Motronic 2.8. The last version was called C20LN (Low Noise) and has a stronger engine block.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{significant}} {{changes were made}} in 1987. These included an improved cylinder head, intake manifold and throttle body injection module, a more-modern serpentine belt with an automatic spring-loaded tensioner for the accessories, and a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> (DIS). This revision to the engine increased power to [...]|$|E
50|$|Eight {{thermoplastic}} tubes {{were used}} in the induction system, providing for sequential fuel injection. The engine used a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> with a waste spark setup. The PCM (powertrain control module) controls spark and fuel injection timing as well as the shift points for the new 4T80-E transmission.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-1984, the 3.8 liter LD5 {{engine was}} {{modified}} for transverse-mounting in smaller, FWD vehicles, and equipped with multi point fuel injection (MPFI). 1984-1985 models used a distributor and a <b>distributorless</b> wasted spark <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was added for all engines produced in 1986 and later. In 1986, it received sequential fuel injection (SFI) {{and it was}} initially produced in two forms, the LG2 with flat lifters (tappets), and the LG3 with a roller camshaft and lifters. The latter was offered in various models through 1988. From 1986, the 3.8 had a revised, crankshaft-driven oil pump which eliminated a longstanding problem with pump housing wear and loss of prime. Power produced by this engine was: ...|$|R
50|$|While {{it still}} retains OHV chain drive pushrod layout {{it now has}} {{hydraulic}} tappets. Also now uses twin coil <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Development of {{an updated}} FN-10 began in 1993, with a design freeze {{occurring}} in November 1994. The first prototypes {{were built in}} September 1995, testing into mid-1996. In September 1996, Alcan Aluminum Limited won a bid to supply hoods for the revised FN-10. In the fall of 1996, the Mark VIII received a significant facelift since its 1992 debut, featuring smoother, more rounded front and rear fascias and a larger grille. The car's hood was now aluminum (versus plastic before) and the trunk carried a more subtle version of the [...] "spare tire hump" [...] associated with earlier Mark Series cars. HID headlamps became standard and were placed in larger housings compared to earlier models. A neon brake light ran across the rear decklid. Side mirrors now came with puddle lamps, which, upon unlocking the doors, illuminated the ground for the driver and passengers to see when entering the car. The side-view mirror housings also incorporated flashing LED turn signal lamps to warn other drivers of an intended lane change or turn. The interior included 'theater lighting', which softly illuminated the driver's controls and handles. The 4.6 L InTech V8 carried on as before, but now came with a <b>distributorless</b> coil-on-plug <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> eliminating the use of high-voltage spark plug wires. Some of the internal components of the 4R70W automatic transmission were reinforced for greater durability and reliability in late 1997 models and all 1998 models. LSC models had firmer shocks and larger stabilizer bars for even better handling and control. All-speed traction control was now standard, and could be deactivated via the onboard systems status computer when desired.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} of the Escort {{was one of the}} first Ford automobiles to feature, on the 1.9 L engine, distributorless ignition (known as EDIS, Electronic <b>Distributorless</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>System).</b> It also featured a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as an independent rear suspension, both (at the time) relatively uncommon in cars in this class.|$|E
5000|$|Six-cylinder X300s are {{powered by}} the AJ16 inline-six engine, which is a further {{enhancement}} of the AJ6 engine that uses an electronic <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> The V12 remained available {{until the end of}} the X300 production in 1997 (although it ended one year earlier in the United States market due to problems meeting OBD-II-related emissions requirements.) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1988 {{the second}} {{generation}} of the Valencia unit was launched to meet with tightening European emissions legislation. The redesign included an all-new cylinder head with reshaped combustion chambers and inlet ports, and a fully electronic <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> The engine was renamed the Ford HCS (standing for High Compression Swirl), although some internal Ford service publications call it the Valencia-HCS in reference to its heritage.|$|E
5000|$|The Rear engine/Rear drive version {{initially}} {{installed in}} the Sambar used a distributor, but a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> was used from 1996 on. Like the EN07F, the high durability version used in the delivery-service version has a rocker cover decorated with a crimson ceramic coating.|$|R
5000|$|Both the 3.2 and 4.0 were {{substantially}} revised for the 1995 {{launch of}} the new X300 saloon. These are the [...] "AJ16" [...] engines, both now featuring coil-on-plug <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition,</b> new engine management systems, magnesium alloy valve covers, revised pistons and other detail changes. The AJ16 was discontinued with the {{launch of the}} AJ-V8 (XK8 and XJ8 in 1996/7).|$|R
50|$|For the 1993 IndyCar World Series, Delco Electronics {{had been}} {{developing}} a smaller more powerful controller using 32-bit computers and a high-level software language called Modula-GM. This system was called Gen-4 and won much praise for its improved functions and features. The telemetry system {{developed for the}} 1992 season was used, and a new <b>Distributorless</b> <b>Ignition</b> module component {{was added to the}} overall engine management system. 10 wins including the 1993 Indianapolis 500 in 16 CART races.|$|R
50|$|The 1G-GZE was a {{supercharged}} version {{produced from}} 1986 till 1992. Output was 168 hp (125 kW) at 6000 rpm and 167 lb·ft (226 Nm) at 3600 rpm. Like the turbo, {{it was a}} 24-valve DOHC engine but featured a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> (DIS). 1G-GZE was mated only with automatic gearboxes. In August 1991 it was replaced with 1JZ-GE on the Mark II/Chaser/Cresta, while serving on the Crown until 1992.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2007+ GMT900 Silverado/Sierra trucks, the LU3 engine {{received}} a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> - the traditional distributor was eliminated where a stub shaft was used. Also the crankshaft sensor was upgraded to a 58x reluctor wheel (same as the GEN IV LSx) {{which resulted in}} the timing cover redesigned (this time the cover is aluminum alloy in lieu of the composite cover; the timing cover bolt pattern {{is not the same as}} the 1996-06 LU3 and L35.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, the Vulcan was {{updated with}} reduced {{friction}} pistons, a strengthened block, roller camshaft and other changes {{that resulted in}} a power rating of [...] and a torque rating of [...] In 1995, further improvements were made; all Vulcans were now equipped with a <b>Distributorless</b> <b>Ignition</b> <b>System</b> (DIS) utilizing a coil pack in its place, with a new intake manifold, changes in engine management and cam timing; output was further increased to [...] and [...] In 2000, power output increased again, up [...] and 16 lbft Nm. A plastic upper intake was added in 2001.|$|E
50|$|It used an {{enhanced}} prototype {{form of the}} 1G-GEU engine called the LASREα-X, a 1,988 cc EFI twin cam 24-valve inline six engine equipped with dual turbo-chargers and intercooler, computer-controlled valve timing, variable displacement and induction. At low speeds, the variable displacement system shut down half the engine to conserve fuel. The system never went into production but a simplified version later appeared as the 1G-GTE, slightly modified for production and without the variable cam timing and variable displacement. In search of reducing maintenance, the FX-1's engine also featured computer-controlled <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In May 1984, the Carina FF four-door sedan (T150 series) was introduced. The styling echoed {{that of the}} {{previous}} generation, using four headlights and grille setup. The upper trim level model has aerodynamic headlight option. Rather than replace the entire line-up all at once because sales of {{the previous}} generation were still good, Toyota gradually introduced the replacement Coupé, Van (wagon) models in stages. The 1,800 cc engine is electronically controlled <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition,</b> and a 2,000 cc diesel is added. Other 1600 cc EFI [...] "4A-ELU" [...] engine, and a carburetor is used on the 1500 cc with [...] "3A-LU" [...] type engine. The 1800SE models were still offered.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its first}} couple years of {{production}} the Tacoma sold very well, attracting many young buyers. The first generation Tacoma underwent a minor headlight upgrade from recessed to flush headlights in October 1996 on 2WD models {{and a total}} of two cosmetic facelifts: the first in July 1997, and the second in October 2000. The facelifts mainly entailed grilles (model year MY1998 and 2001) and tailgate badging and emblems (MY1998). Mechanical changes included a switch to <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignitions</b> (coil-on-plug) in 1996 and in 1997 longer rear leaf springs. A passenger-side air bag was added in July 1997, and the driver's side air bag (standard from 1995 launch) was [...] "depowered". Most 4x4 models came with Toyota's Automatic Differential Disconnect (ADD) system after the 2000 model year.|$|R
50|$|The Honda K series {{engine is}} a four-cylinder {{four-stroke}} engine introduced in 2001. The K series engines {{are equipped with}} DOHC valvetrains and use roller rockers to reduce friction. The engines use a coil-on-plug, <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> with a coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes {{the use of a}} conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B-series & F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H-series and newer F series engines found only in the Honda S2000.|$|E
50|$|K16 models used MEMS, with a 1.6 ECU from 1990 until 1994 and a 1.9 ECU from 1995 onwards, {{in either}} Single Point or Multi Point forms, {{with a single}} coil {{on the back of}} the engine block and a {{distributor}} cap and rotor arm on the end of the inlet camshaft. MEMS 2J was used on the VVC engine, to control the Variable Valve Control and the <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> which was used because there were camshaft drive belts at both ends of the engine. With the launch of the Rover 25 and Rover 45 in 1999, MEMS 3 was introduced, with twin coils and sequential injection.|$|E
5000|$|The current-production [...] "HEMI" [...] engine {{heads are}} flatter {{and more complex}} than the 1950s-'70s Hemi V8 chamber. The {{chambers}} are no longer truly hemispherical. It uses a coil-on-plug <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> and two spark plugs per cylinder to shorten flame travel leading to more consistent combustion and reduced emissions. Like most of Chrysler's past-model Hemi-head engines, the 5.7 version is rated at approximately one horsepower per cubic inch (the current engines are SAE net, whereas the old Hemi engines were rated SAE gross). For the 2009 model year power was increased to 357-395 horsepower (266-291 kW) and 389-410 lb·ft (527-556 N·m) depending on application. It also achieved 4% better fuel economy. Variable valve timing (VVT) was also introduced.|$|E
50|$|The Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> {{also known}} as the Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> is a type of Inductive {{discharge}} <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> invented by Charles F. Kettering. It was first sold commercially on the 1910 Cadillac and was manufactured by Delco. Over time, this system was used extensively by all automobile and truck manufacturers until the development of capacitor discharge <b>ignition</b> (electronic <b>ignition)</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1960s. Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> were also used by a number of early aircraft engines.|$|R
5000|$|... 1910: An {{inductive}} discharge <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> {{invented by}} Charles F. Kettering {{and his company}} Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco) goes into production for Cadillac. The Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is a mechanically-switched version of a flyback boost converter; the transformer is the ignition coil. Variations of this <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> were used in all non-diesel internal combustion engines until the 1960s when it was displaced with capacitive discharge <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{intention}} of improving ignition performance of natural gas engine, a dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was devised according to energy superposition principle. Using Multisim software and experimental apparatus, the variation of secondary voltage along with discharge time interval was studied by taking simulation and experimental methods. The results show that dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> can enhance the secondary voltage, increase spark duration and accomplish multiple discharge under different discharge time interval compared with single-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> So the dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is conducive to reliable ignition for natural gas engine under different working conditions and it provides a way to optimize the <b>ignition</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1999 model year, {{vehicles}} with the 4.0 L engine received a revised intake manifold. This was done to help counteract smaller exhaust porting on the latest casting of cylinder heads, which was done to meet more stringent emissions control laws. Both the four- and six-cylinder engines were offered through the 2000 model year, though only the straight-six was available in 2001. For the 2000 and 2001 model years, all six-cylinder XJs received a <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> using coil-on-plug ignition replacing the [...] "traditional" [...] system previously used; coupled with better exhaust porting and the newer intake manifolds, this gave a minor increase in power over the previous models. Transmission, axle, and transfer case choices were carried over from the previous models.|$|E
5000|$|During the mid-1970s, the Buick 231 and Chevrolet 90-Degree 4.3L V6 engine (essentially a 350 cubic-inch small-block Chevy V-8 {{with the}} two rear {{cylinders}} removed) were replacing the Chevrolet 250 for use in passenger cars and light duty trucks/vans. Passenger car use of the [...] engine was discontinued after the 1979 model year for North America (along with the Chevrolet 292), since the six was restricted to light truck usage (the 4.1 was discontinued after 1984 in North America, where the Vortec 4.3 V6 became the base engine). Brazil {{held on to the}} 250 (known as the 4.1 there) until 1998 for passenger cars, when the Chevrolet Omega A was replaced by rebadged Australian Holdens. It was used in Brazil until 2001 in Chevrolet Silverado when the engine line was discontinued. The Brazilian produced sixes gained multipoint fuel injection, <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> and redesigned cylinder heads which had smaller intake ports.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Opel {{identified}} {{the need for}} a modern, lightweight and compact power plant to replace its ageing straight-6 engine range. These engines have a cast iron engine block with cast aluminium alloy cylinder heads. The cylinder heads contain 4 valves per cylinder actuated by dual overhead camshafts which are driven by a timing belt. These engines however, differed from many modern V6 engines in that it has a 54 degree cylinder bank angle; as opposed to the more conventional 60 degree setup. This added to the engines' compactness which was needed to allow its use in front-wheel drive applications, as well as rear-wheel drive cars. Other features of these engines include: an oil to water heat exchanger is mounted within the V of the engine block, Bosch Motronic engine management system with full sequential fuel injection, knock control on each bank, <b>distributorless</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> (DIS), and closed loop lambda control.|$|E
2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires {{a significant amount of}} electrical current from the battery, resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} examine the effects of elevated initial tube pressure in the Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) run-up distance, DDT times, and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was employed, along with two plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> to quantify the benefits of each. Measured results show a reduction in the ignition time of roughly 50 % and in the DDT distance of roughly 30 %, for all three fuels at an initial tube pressure of 3 atmospheres. With atmospheric initial tube pressure, the transient plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> yielded the shortest ignition times, followed by the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> and lastly the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> At roughly 2 atmospheres of initial pressure the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> showed no benefit over the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> C-J wave speeds have shown to increase with elevated initial pressure, and agree with numerical results. In addition to the experimental results, a brief Chemkin analysis was done to model the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> to estimate <b>ignition</b> times of the mixtures at pressures that were not tested.

40|$|To improve {{combustion}} {{stability of}} DISI-engines a plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> {{was developed and}} investigated. Due to its special set-up the plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> allows extremely short discharges with much higher efficiency than conventional coil <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Ignition</b> of lean mixtures is improved by the generation of an enlarged fame kernel at homogeneous and stratified engine operation as well. At stratified engine operation the plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> leads to a larger process window and to slightly higher fuel consumption, {{which is due to}} a shifted process position. The more stable engine operation is not attributable to a remote impact of the plasma ignition...|$|R
