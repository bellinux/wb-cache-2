5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The inedible fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emission follows a diurnal pattern.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

But the very nature of computer work and the overuse of them are causing computer related health hazards which merit urgent attention and self-regulation. The elements of working at a computer which make it visually demanding include frequent saccadic eye movements, continuous eye focusing and alignment demands with constant shifting between di erent <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> When working on the computer our eyes move from the screen to the keyboard to the table about 25, 000 times.

Researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power for use on Earth. Space-based solar power has been in research since the early 1970s. Space-based solar power would require construction of collector structures in space. The advantage over ground-based solar power is higher <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and no weather to interrupt power collection.|$|E

25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} {{describes}} {{the ability of}} light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> passing through it. An {{example of such a}} mineral is muscovite (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. Jadeite and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.|$|E
25|$|During operation, {{light from}} a laser source travels through an optical fiber to {{illuminate}} {{the surface of a}} reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.|$|E
25|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} {{and intensity of}} light: Electromagnetic radiation {{is a form of}} energy. As such, it may speed up the rate or even make a reaction spontaneous as it provides the particles of the reactants with more energy. This energy is {{in one way or another}} stored in the reacting particles (it may break bonds, promote molecules to electronically or vibrationally excited states...) creating intermediate species that react easily. As the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> increases, the particles absorb more energy and hence the rate of reaction increases.|$|E

Phototropic "indifference" alone occurs at high intensities due to equal photic action {{on both sides of}} the sporangiophore. If heat radiation is not screened out, a gradual, negative thermotropic bending takes place...|$|R
25|$|Birefringence {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> through electrically induced birefringence of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. Wave plates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E
25|$|Photosystem II {{is damaged}} by light {{irrespective}} of light intensity. The quantum yield of the damaging reaction in typical leaves of higher plants exposed to visible light, {{as well as}} in isolated thylakoid membrane preparations, is in the range of 10−8 to 10−7 and independent of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> This means that one PSII complex is damaged for every 10-100 million photons that are intercepted. Therefore, photoinhibition occurs at all light intensities and the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity. Some measurements suggest that dim light causes damage more efficiently than strong light.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, 1852, there {{appeared}} {{the paper on}} the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, and in 1853 {{an investigation of the}} metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction, a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar, transparent calcite crystals.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{photoreceptor}} cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells are sensitive to the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century Johannes Kepler {{expanded}} on geometric optics in his writings, covering lenses, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, {{the principles of}} pinhole cameras, inverse-square law governing the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and the optical explanations of astronomical phenomena such as lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax. He was also able to correctly deduce {{the role of the}} retina as the actual organ that recorded images, finally being able to scientifically quantify the effects of different types of lenses that spectacle makers had been observing over the previous 300 years. After the invention of the telescope Kepler set out the theoretical basis on how they worked and described an improved version, known as the Keplerian telescope, using two convex lenses to produce higher magnification.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency).
