5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He took office <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> regular annual budget surpluses {{and left the}} city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E
5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by {{thousands of people who}} were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 {{video game}} , {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released for the PlayStation 3 video game console, features combat scenes {{that take place}} within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England set in an alternate history. It was released on 23 March 2007 in the United Kingdom. The use of images of the cathedral caused controversy {{with the leaders of}} the Church of England, which claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it was inappropriate of Sony to allow players to fire guns <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> a gun problem. They have made several legal threats against Sony. They intended to make several demands of Sony, including an apology, a substantial donation, complete withdrawal of the game or modifying the segment featuring the interior of the cathedral, and financial support of Manchester groups trying to reduce gun crime in the city.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympics {{were held}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{the first time since}} NHL players were allowed to compete that the Olympics were held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> an NHL team. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a {{narrower}} NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 61metres×26metres (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft). This change saved an expected $10million (CAD) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games. Games were played at the UBC Winter Sports Centre and Rogers Arena (then GM Place at the time), which was renamed Canada Hockey Place during the event because corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue. Twelve teams qualified for the men's event and were split into three groups of four teams. At the NHL's request, the number of preliminary games was lowered to three. Following the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1 through 12 based on points. The top four ranked teams received byes to the quarter-finals, and the other eight teams played for the remaining four positions. Following that, the final eight teams competed in a playoff.|$|E

25|$|The University Charter of 1900 also {{included}} provision for a commerce faculty, as {{was appropriate for}} a university itself founded by industrialists and based <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> enormous business wealth, in effect creating the first Business School in England. Consequently, the faculty, {{the first of its}} kind in Britain, was founded by Sir William Ashley in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty.|$|E
25|$|Van Leeuwenhoek was a {{contemporary}} of another famous Delft citizen, the painter Johannes Vermeer, who was baptized {{just four days}} earlier. It {{has been suggested that}} he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, The Astronomer and The Geographer, however, others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> only 24,000 inhabitants, it is likely that they were at least acquaintances; Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the executor of Vermeer's will after the painter died in 1675.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{not clear}} when {{precisely}} the church was further raised to the status of cathedral, a unique move <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn's successor as Archbishop, Henry de Loundres, was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick's, this election being recognised by Pope Innocent III. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the Cathedral and Chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of Dean to head the Cathedral, the right of election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.|$|E
25|$|Juarez Street {{is one of}} the few through streets on the surface. It {{is filled}} with stores and {{restaurants}} and has a constant flow of people and traffic. The other through streets of town are either partially or fully underground, following the old drainage ditches and tunnels dug during colonial times. Originally they were used for flood control, but modern dams have controlled flooding and left them dry, so they have been turned into thoroughfares <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> little surface area. The most important of these roads is Miguel Hidalgo or Belaunzarán, which carried the runoff from the river that used to divide the city in two. Guanajuato’s version of the La Llorona story has the woman wandering its tunnels, some of which had rivers or streams running through them.|$|E

[...] Throngs of people constantly packed {{the grounds of the}} courts, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} Adrian Lim and to hear the revelations first-hand. [...] Reported by regional newspapers in detail, the gory and sexually explicit recounting of Lim's acts offended the sensibilities of some; Canon Frank Lomax, Vicar of St. Andrew's Anglican Church, complained to The Straits Times that the reports could have a corrupting effect on the young. [...] His words received support from a few readers. [...] Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> low crime rates. [...] Books, which covered the murders and the trial, were quickly bought by the public on their release.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Drexel University {{announced}} {{its plans to}} create a new law school adjacent to the Drexel University Main Campus W. W. Hagerty library in West Philadelphia. That same year Drexel received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to start the school. The decision to launch a law school with cooperative education <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> five other law schools was based on a demand for graduates with immediate experience, with the president of Drexel University, Constantine Papadakis, saying that employers [...] "like to hire a graduate and have them immediately be useful." [...] The School of Law joins Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Rutgers University, and Widener University to become the sixth law school in the Delaware Valley. The School of Law is the first new law school to be opened by a doctoral university in a 25-year period nationwide.|$|E
500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time.

500|$|Daley {{came into}} office <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> revenue-generating assets, {{manageable}} debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind {{a city with a}} structural deficit that Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel estimated at $1.2 billion when under-funded pension funds were included. The Daley administration's expenditures exceeded revenues by {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} a year. In August 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded the city's bond credit rating, citing the administration's use of reserve funds for general operating expenses and under-funding of its pension funds, and noted that the city faced rising fixed operating costs yet lacked plans for new revenue. Wall Street analysts noted that the Daley administration began drawing on the city's reserves as early as 2006, before the 2008–2012 global recession. [...] "While there had been sound economic growth in years prior to 2008, there were still sizable fund balance drawdowns in both 2006 and 2007," [...] Fitch wrote. The city's budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city's annual deficit exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011, Moody's Investors Service downgraded to a [...] "negative" [...] outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion O'Hare Modernization Program and related infrastructure projects, citing the city's plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Cases of {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{can occur}} {{in a city that}} does not have a contaminated water supply. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> clean water, it may be that cases of cryptosporidiosis have different origins.

Cryptosporidium is causing serious illness [...] more frequently in immunocompromised than in apparently healthy individuals. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviors can transmit the parasite directly.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Rupert Murdoch bought Post for US$30.5 million. [...] Post at {{this point}} was the only {{surviving}} afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after {{the failure of the}} competing World Journal Tribune. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>with</b> worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into Posts profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. (The paper has lost money ever since). Under Murdoch's watch, Post veered sharply to the right editorially, in accordance with Murdoch's views.|$|E
