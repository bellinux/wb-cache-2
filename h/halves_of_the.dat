5|$|Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone {{arch bridge}} that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, {{connecting}} the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It {{was designed by}} James Paine and Kenton Couse.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
2500|$|In photography, stops {{are also}} a unit used to {{quantify}} ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor <b>of</b> one-half. <b>The</b> one-stop unit {{is also known as}} the EV (exposure value) unit. On a camera, the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as f-stops. Each [...] "stop" [...] is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a <b>halving</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of 1/ or about 0.7071, and hence a <b>halving</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pupil.|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E

In the southern bastion is the Duke of Wellington's Room and the Lucas Room, originally part of an apartment of rooms selected by William Pitt for his use, as they formed the warmest part of the castle.

5|$|Both <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road {{trace their}} origins {{to the early}} days of Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E

The downstream <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.

50|$|Each team plays {{each other}} three times. During every season, which is held between August and May, the 12 teams play {{against each other}} twice. Once each club had played 22 matches, each team has their points total halved (rounded up if the points don't equal a whole number, e.g. 31 points = 16 points when halved).

5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson {{was then}} hired, but he {{proved to be}} unpopular with Hibs supporters.

Williamson departed {{near the end of}} that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray.

5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E

5|$|West of the Oder–Neisse line, the German {{states were}} reorganised {{along the lines}} of the zones of occupation, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the {{northern}} <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former states of Württemberg and Baden were merged to form Württemberg-Baden in 1946. As its flag, Württemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to Württemberg's colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden's colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could be mistaken for a combination of the two flags. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, whose flag is black and gold.|$|E

25|$|In photography, {{dynamic range}} is {{measured}} in exposure value (EV) differences (known as stops). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> light.

Therefore, revealing detail in <b>the</b> darkest <b>of</b> shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.|$|R
