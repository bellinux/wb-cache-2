5|$|After ranking 17th of 48 {{clubs in}} the Football League North in 1942–43, York progressed through the War Cup {{qualifying}} stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time. They were beaten 4–1 over two legs by Sheffield Wednesday. In the 1943–44 Football League North, the team finished 31st of 50 clubs, and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7–2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. York experienced selection problems in 1944–45 with many players leaving for war service; after ranking 42nd of 54 {{clubs in the}} Football League North, they then failed {{to qualify for the}} War Cup knock-out stages. They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945–46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. York finished midtable in the Third Division North (East) {{in the first half of}} the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. The FA Cup resumed this season, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11–1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. York made a profit in five of the seven seasons played during the war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{training}} sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which {{were held in}} front of opposition swimmers {{in an attempt to}} intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2min 33s, which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2.0s. He posted a time of 2min 31.4s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8s, an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark, {{and by the end of}} the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2min 28.7s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half.|$|E

5|$|He {{would go}} on to score 23 times for Wales, {{including}} a hat-trick against Belgium in 1949 and braces against England (twice), Portugal, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. He won his final cap on 20 October 1950, scoring in a 2–2 draw with Scotland. His total of 23 goals was a record for Wales at the time before being equaled by Ivor Allchurch and eventually surpassed by Ian Rush and Gareth Bale. However, Ford's tally of 38 caps during his career was significantly lower than either Rush or Allchurch, who gained 73 and 68 caps respectively. In 1958, Wales qualified for the FIFA World Cup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> to date only time in their history but Ford was serving his suspension from the British game which meant he was overlooked for selection and {{was not included in the}} Welsh squad for the 1958 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, although he had to back down from a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition {{to ensure that the}} originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E

On lap 22, Harvick's engine failed, allowing the third caution to come out.

He remained leading the next two laps, while Earnhardt, Jr. moved to the 5th position. On lap29, Reutimann and Michael Waltrip collided, causing a multi-car pileup, involving 17drivers, including {{three of the four}} drivers from Hendrick Motorsports: Johnson, Martin, and Gordon.

5|$|Paul gained 33 caps for Wales. He did {{not gain}} any under-age caps, {{as in his}} era Wales did not field an under-23 team. He {{received}} his first cap in October 1948, in a 3–1 defeat against Scotland. His only international goal came in a 5–1 win against Belgium in November 1949. In October 1955 Paul {{was part of the}} Wales team that beat England 2–1, the first Welsh victory against England in 18 years. Six months later Wales faced Ireland in their final match of that season's British Home Championship. Wales were leading 1–0 when a handball by Danny Blanchflower gave Wales a penalty. Paul took the kick, but it was saved by Norman Uprichard. Paul's failure cost Wales victory, as Jimmy Jones equalised in the second half and the match finished 1–1. A draw in the remaining fixture between Scotland and England meant that the miss also denied Wales victory in the tournament. Instead, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> only time there was a four-way tie. Paul did not play for Wales again.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore was a night race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that {{the gap between the}} first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five {{towards the end of the}} session. While Ricciardo felt he could go even faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat was able to put in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.|$|E

5|$|The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VIII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held between February 18–28, 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States. Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the {{infrastructure}} {{and all of the}} venues were built at a cost of US$80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each. Swedish cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games.|$|E
