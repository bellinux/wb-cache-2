25|$|The Turkish State Hydraulic Works {{devised a}} plan in 1994 to dam the Ilya River with Yortanlı Dam, {{creating}} a reservoir {{in order to increase}} agricultural productivity in the region. The Allianoi bath complex lies within the proposed reservoir area, meaning it would be covered in water should the dam project go through. Protests from ICOMOS, UNESCO, <b>Europa</b> <b>Nostra,</b> and the EU have done little but to delay the inevitability of the project. As of December 31, 2010, Yortanli Dam started filling water and Allianoi is already under 61 million meter cubic water.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, {{the station}} hall was modernised in a {{contemporary}} style, {{and the front}} walls were clad with sheet metal. A new ticket hall made of glass was also added into the main station hall. Public opinion, however, was not in favour of the typical 1980s building style, and the topic of renovation resurfaced {{as early as the}} mid-1990s. The station therefore was properly restorated to its original state. Since the station hall had meanwhile become a listed building (in 1990), great attention was paid to detail. The station received the <b>Europa</b> <b>Nostra</b> Award in 2001 for the restoration effort.|$|E

The conservatory houses ten computer-controlled micro-climatic zones, with {{the bulk of}} the greenhouse volume composed of Dry Tropics and Wet Tropics plants. Significant numbers of orchids, water lilies, cacti, lithops, carnivorous plants and bromeliads are housed in the various zones.

The statues of Saint Vincent of Saragossa and the Archangel Michael received the same treatment. In 1999 the project received the <b>Europa</b> <b>Nostra</b> award for its restoration of the exterior. The Belém Tower was added on 7 July 2007 to the registry of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.|$|E

500|$|From 1974 to 1990 {{the canal}} benefited from job {{creation}} schemes run by the Manpower Services Commission and Youth Training Scheme {{to work on the}} northern section from Resolven to Ysgwrfa. By 1990 there was [...] of navigable canal, including 7 restored locks and a slipway at Resolven basin. It received a 1998 <b>Europa</b> <b>Nostra</b> award for the quality of the work, and a Civic Trust Award in 1992. The £4million project was jointly funded by the Welsh Office and the Prince of Wales Trust. The Rheola aqueduct {{in the middle of this}} section was refurbished by the Canals Society in 1990. The stream that is now carried under the canal had previously been carried over it in a cast iron trough, but was diverted through a channel cut across the canal bed after high flows overtopped the trough. This required the construction of a new aqueduct, and once completed, the Canals Society launched their trip boat, named Thomas Dadford, on 12 July 1990, to provide canal trips for the public. The Enfys also provided boat trips for the Enfys Trust from the Tŷ Banc former lock-keepers cottage at Resolven, until 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{due to its}} ruinous state, {{the castle}} was included, {{at the request of}} the Transylvania Trust, in the World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Also in 1999, a {{bilateral}} State Agreement was signed between Romania and Hungary for the restoration and rehabilitation works.
