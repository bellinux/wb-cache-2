25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. <b>Dare</b> <b>I</b> say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

[...] Coppola was able to stoically accept the critical and commercial reaction to Tucker: The Man and His Dream.

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, The Washington Post ran a 13-part series billed, in part, as [...] "a tale of the tabloid and {{mainstream}} press pack journalism that helped derail the investigation". The two investigative reporters behind the Post series, Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz, wrote a book detailing their investigation. The book, Finding Chandra, was published in May 2010. Commentators, including The Washington Post Metro reporter Robert Pierre, wrote that emphasis on a glamorous white murder victim, when [...] "about 200 people are killed in this city every year, most of them black and male", was [...] "absolutely absurd and <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say, racist, at its core".|$|E

500|$|Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle {{wrote that}} he was [...] "only so-so" [...] about the episode, which he deemed [...] "uneven", but was still pleased that the series was back. Vanity Fair Brett Berk called the episode [...] "a bit haphazard", and commented: [...] "this kind of {{spiraling}} frenzy is not only unsustainable, but ultimately dizzying and, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say it, a little boring." [...] Randee Dawn of The Hollywood Reporter reported that [...] "Hell-O" [...] had a [...] "stagy quality", and was [...] "not an episode that would have sold the series early on".

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Ring of Fates {{was well}} {{received}} by reviewers; Neal Chandran of RPGFan, although finding the original soundtrack to be [...] "bland", {{felt that the}} Crystal Chronicles soundtrack was [...] "quite varied, exciting, and <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say really freaking good" [...] and praised the variety of styles and moods of the tracks. Chris was also enthusiastic about the soundtrack, praising it as [...] "one of the finest accompaniments to a Final Fantasy game ever produced". He noted, however, that the soundtrack works best as a [...] "flowing" [...] work or accompaniment to the game, {{with a lack of}} individual tracks that stood out as memorable. Don of Square Enix Music Online was much harsher towards the soundtrack, terming it an [...] "extremely underwhelming album". He disapproved of the change from the medieval instrumentation to a more orchestral score, and felt that the pieces had much less emotional intensity than the Crystal Chronicles soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Simple {{movements}} {{were developed by}} their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as The New York Times reported, they believed [...] "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children". [...] According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves {{in order to identify}} more with their young audience. [...] The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. [...] "So [...] Wiggles have kind of become a bit more, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported. [...] In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in acrobatics and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former trampoline champion Karl Shore. [...] Watkins, whom Paul Field called [...] "a dancer of many disciplines", was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as [...] "mainly a dancer".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on the Oprah Winfrey {{show and}} received a standing ovation from her cast members, the audience, and left Oprah speechless. Upon the song's completion, Oprah simply exclaimed, [...] "Wow." [...] The second performance was at the 49th Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center, in Los Angeles, California, on February 11, 2007. MTV News' staff members coined it as the Best Oscar Performance, writing: [...] "Beyoncé killed it with a passionate performance of 'Listen'." [...] Beyoncé later performed [...] "Listen" [...] with Alexandra Burke on December 16, 2008, at the final of The X Factor, with Burke having performed the song alone two weeks previously. Burke battled to control her emotions when Beyoncé joined her on stage and dissolved into tears when their duet was over. Burke {{went on to win}} the competition later that night. Barbara Ellen of The Observer praised Beyoncé's performance of the song saying that [...] "there seemed something a little overpowering, invulnerable, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say, ungenerous, about Beyoncé - almost as if she were a giant slithering diva/snake hell bent on swallowing poor quivering Burke whole." ...|$|E
500|$|My Gym Partner's a Monkey {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. William Barker of Web Wombat gave the King of the Jungle DVD a positive review, awarding {{it with a}} score of 70%, saying: [...] "With an original – <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say unique? – premise, My Gym Partner's a Monkey makes for a somewhat refreshing change from super heroes and mutants, and the cut-out animation style is captivating, though far from novel. It's not the most impressive cartoon show I've ever seen, but it's quite cute and fairly amusing – even for the older primates among us." [...] Larisa Wiseman of Common Sense Media awarded the series three out of five stars, saying: [...] "It's difficult to tell what age group the show's producers were aiming at – the animation style and slapstick by themselves would seem to appeal mainly to grade-schoolers, while the jokes and life lessons are definitely aimed at the tween set. The sly humor may even give some adults the occasional laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, My Gym Partner's a Monkey is commendable for its effort to include a subtle message in each episode. Younger viewers will probably find Jake's sometimes-annoying goofiness amusing, and will definitely find the story lines entertaining." ...|$|E

500|$|Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine {{called it}} [...] "a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy, 'Roxanne'-esque new-wave groove to a soulful, synth-driven chorus." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters further {{explained}} the track, writing, [...] "It starts out like an early Police single, with some straight-up Reggatta de Blanc syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression. But the chorus opens up {{to turn into}} something less Police-y and more, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say it, Bruno Mars-y." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the song [...] "channels the Police, but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson. It's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels." [...] Jason Lipshut of Billboard gave a very positive review, stating that [...] "'Locked out of Heaven' is Mars' best solo single to date, with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act. Sometimes, the perfect lead single is hard to find; other times, it walks right {{up to you and}} delivers a big, cozy hug." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised [...] "Mars' singing and the catchy little background vocals," [...] which according to her, [...] "keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace." [...] She also noted that [...] "Even clumsy lyrics like 'your sex takes me to paradise' can’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1996, Oasis were widely considered, {{according}} to guitarist Noel Gallagher, [...] "the biggest band in the world... bigger than, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say it, fucking God." [...] The commercial success of the band's two previous albums had resulted in media frenzy and an ubiquity in the mainstream press that {{was in danger of}} leading to a backlash. Oasis members were by then being invited to functions at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair and holidaying with Johnny Depp and Kate Moss in Mick Jagger's villa in Mustique. During their last stay on the island, Noel wrote the majority of the songs that would make up Oasis's third album. He had suffered from writer's block during the previous winter, and has since admitted he wrote only a single guitar riff in the six months following the release of (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. After a few weeks [...] "idling", he disciplined himself to a routine of songwriting where he would go [...] "into this room in the morning, come out for lunch, go back in, come out for dinner, go back in, then go to bed." [...] Noel has later said about the album [...] "...most of the songs were written before I even got a record deal, I went away and wrote the lyrics in about two weeks." [...] The band's producer Owen Morris joined Gallagher later with a TASCAM 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a keyboard.|$|E

[...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave [...] "The Constant" [...] an excellent review, saying that [...] "my mind has never spun this fast after a Lost episode" [...] and the writers have [...] "really outdone themselves" [...] and [...] "do not get enough credit for constantly tinkering with their story structure". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post said that this [...] "episode of Lost not only continued this season's thrilling momentum; it proved to fans that even in its fourth season, it still leaves us with our jaws hanging open … this was the make of possibly {{one of my favorite}} Lost episodes ever." [...] Glatfelter also praised the characters, Daniel [...] "more and more becoming one of [...] favorite characters" [...] and calling Desmond [...] "the most intriguing character on Lost [...] the best love story on the show and <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say on television today". [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as an [...] "A+", considering it {{to be one of the}} best Lost episodes.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (<b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings about everything from his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to feel like he or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the best part is watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save your cash for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably no one else will purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

2500|$|As {{the poet}} implores [...] "Sweet love" [...] (1) {{to conquer the}} lust that is ruining his union with the young man. This {{analysis}} of the sonnet relies upon two assumptions: 1) the young man is the poet's lover and 2) that when the poet refers to [...] "sad interim" [...] (9), he {{does not mean that}} the young man is away from London, but that he is separated from him emotionally - i.e., they are in a [...] "period of estrangement" [...] from one another due to the young man's promiscuity. Thus the poet is [...] "whipping up the young man's flagging affection. Behind lines 9-12 flickers a reminiscence of the situation of Hero and Leander" [...] (Rowse 115). The situation becomes even more clear when we read Sonnet 57, in which the poet, now very worried about the young man's lustful nature, asks him outright, [...] "Being your slave, what should I do but tend/Upon the hours and times of your desire?... <b>dare</b> <b>I</b> question with my jealous thought/Where you may be" [...] (1-2/9-10).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} after the 1970s, some saw the ethnic {{composition}} of the school's enrollment as changing. [...] In 1979, former Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy: [...] "The growth of the enrolment has {{increased the number of}} boys {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families. [...] The address list now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations." [...] William Kilbourn also said that the College had been accepting, for many years before the 1980s, a number of foreign students, notably from Latin America and Asia, and that UCC had made a concentrated effort to recruit Quebec francophones into the student body. [...] By the 1980s the school was offering financial assistance to the less affluent, and was making serious attempts to encourage boys from visible minorities to enroll. [...] But, few applied, save for many Chinese, East Indian, and Japanese Canadians who were accepted into the Prep; in 1983 the numbers were 42 out of a total student population of 361. However, even into the 1990s some, while acknowledging the shift to a more multi-cultural student body, claimed anti-Semitism continued in some form. In 1990, The College Times featured an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer [...] "a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (<b>dare</b> <b>I</b> say it?) liberal....
