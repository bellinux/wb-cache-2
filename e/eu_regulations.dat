However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant <b>EU</b> <b>regulations,</b> directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud cattle breeding in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free movement of goods between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose the principles of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

40|$|Does <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> hinder or stimulate innovation' is a {{frequently}} heard query in the EU, {{but there}} is little systematic analytical literature on the issue. Fragmented evidence or anecdotes dominate debates among EU regulatory decision-makers and in European business, insofar as there is a genuine debate at all. This CEPS Special Report focuses on the multi-faceted, ambiguous and complex relationship between (<b>EU)</b> <b>regulation</b> and innovation in the economy, and discusses the innovation-enhancing potential of certain regulatory approaches as well as factors that tend to reduce incentives to innovate. We adopt an 'ecosystem' approach to both regulation and innovation and study the interactions between the two ecosystems. This general analysis and survey are complemented by seven case studies of <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> enabling and disabling innovation, two horizontal and five sectoral ones. The case studies are preceded by a broader contextual analysis of trends in <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> over the last three decades. These trends show the significant transformation of the nature as well as improvement of the quality of <b>EU</b> <b>regulation,</b> largely in the deepened internal market, which tend to have a favourable and lasting effect on the rate of innovation in the EU (other things being equal). Our findings include the following: Regulation can at times be a powerful stimulus to innovation. <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> matters at all stages of the innovation process. Different types of regulation can be identified in terms of innovation impact: general or horizontal, innovationspecific and sector-specific regulation. More prescriptive regulation tends to hamper innovative activity, whereas the more flexible <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> is, the better innovation can be stimulated. Lower compliance and red-tape burdens {{have a positive effect on}} innovation. We recommend incorporating a specific test on innovation impacts in the ex-ante impact assessment of EU legislation as well as in ex-post evaluation.

40|$|Originally, {{organic farming}} was a localised, {{self-regulating}} agricultural practice driven by distinct ethical values. In {{the last decades}} organic agriculture has undergone significant growth and development, and now it exhibits organic industries and international trade. Today {{there is a large}} number of different standards, labels and certification bodies, and this is confusing for consumers, traders and the organic farming industry. The <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> 2092 / 91 can therefore be of high importance for the credibility and harmonisation of organic standards. The overall objective of this research project is to provide recommendations for development of the <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> for organic agriculture. The project will identify the basic ethical values and value differences in organic agriculture and develop a procedure for balancing and integrating the basic values in revisions of the <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> (WP 2). It will also establish an organic standards database that enables comparison of national and international organic standards with the <b>EU</b> <b>regulation,</b> and analyse the exposed differences (WP 3). It is expected that these outcomes will help identify trade barriers, provide {{a better understanding of the}} ongoing development of organic agriculture and how it can be regulated, enable regionalisation of the organic production and support harmonisation as well as simplification of the <b>EU</b> <b>regulation</b> so that it may constitute a better basis for communicating in a transparent way with consumers, producers, policy makers and other stakeholders. The project will provide specific recommendations on the derogations of the use of conventional feed (WP 4) and seed (WP 5) in the <b>EU</b> <b>regulation.</b> It will assess the availability of organic seeds and propagation materials and develop information exchange and decision criteria for the seed regime. It will also survey the supply and demand of organic feeds and feed additives and develop evaluation criteria for specific feed and feed additives, thus ensuring animal welfare as well as the credibility of organic agriculture. This is expected to reduce the dependency on inputs from conventional production in organic farming systems. Implementation of the results will be by means of web-page and 3 workshops in close collaboration with the Commission (WP 6). Project objective(s) : The overall objective of this project is to ·	provide recommendations for the revision and further development of the <b>EU</b> <b>Regulation</b> 2092 / 91 and other standards for organic agriculture.

The concept of center of main interests of a debtor has a particular importance in the cross border bankruptcy cases as its location determines the court which is competent to open the insolvency proceedings. Although at the European level adopting the <b>EU</b> <b>Regulation</b> No. 1346 / 29. 05. 2000 was considered a legislative progress in bankruptcy proceedings, in the end it had relatively few applications as it was unable to cover large factual aspects. The mentioned regulation was offering a rigid and abstract definition and interpretation of the COMI concept which resulted in important legal application divergences that lead in the end to a legislative reform. This legislative reform was concluded with the adoption of <b>EU</b> <b>Regulation</b> No. 848 / 20. 5. 2015...|$|R
