5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations {{were based on}} an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

We show that there exists a continuum of equilibria where investors with a higher <b>expectation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> value of shares bid for higher quantities at higher prices, {{and as a result}} the market price increases with the market value.

25|$|An {{influential}} cognitive-behavioral {{approach to}} addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt's (1985) Relapse Prevention approach. Marlatt describes four psychosocial processes {{relevant to the}} addiction and relapse processes: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancies refer to an individual's <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> psychoactive effects of an addictive substance. Attributions of causality refer to an individual's pattern of beliefs that relapse to drug use {{is a result of}} internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E

Burgoyne was apparently not aware that Howe's plans had evolved as they had. [...] Although Germain knew what Howe's plans were, whether he communicated them to Burgoyne is unclear. [...] Some sources claim he did while others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway. Whether Germain, Howe and Burgoyne had the same <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear. Some historians argue that Howe failed to follow instructions and essentially abandoned Burgoyne's army, while others suggest that Burgoyne failed on his own and then tried to shift the blame to Howe and Clinton.|$|E

500|$|Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} the first volume, {{have been used}} in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she [...] "left out" [...] and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes.

Operetta and music halls became available, and new drama theatres such as the Moscow Art Theatre and the Suvorin Theatre in Russia opened. At the same time, commercial newspapers [...] "began to carry theatre columns and reviews" [...] that helped make theatre [...] "a legitimate subject of intellectual debate" [...] in general discussions about art and culture. Audiences began to gather to [...] "appreciate creative achievement, to marvel at, and be entertained by, the prominent 'stars'."

500|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is a different}} approach to the [...] "family" [...] and [...] "household." [...] In classical economics, those units are typically described as amicable and homogeneous. Gary Becker and new home economists introduced the study of [...] "the family" [...] to traditional economics, which usually assumes the family is a single, altruistic unit among which money is distributed equally. Others have concluded that an optimal distribution of commodities and provisions takes place within the family as a result of which they view families {{in the same manner as}} individuals. These models, according to feminist economists, [...] "endorsed traditional <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sexes," [...] and applied individualistic rational-choice models to explain home behavior. Feminist economists modify these assumptions to account for exploitative sexual and gender relations, single-parent families, same-sex relationships, familial relations with children, and the consequences of reproduction. Specifically, feminist economists move beyond unitary household models and game theory to show the diversity of household experiences.|$|E

Under the assumption that the senderfs expected utility is written as the expected value of a quadratic function of those conditional expectations, we identify conditions under which full and no disclosure is optimal for the sender and show that a linear transformation of the state is optimal if it is normally distributed. We apply our theory to advertising, political campaigning, and monetary policy. ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{opposite to}} {{the placebo effect}} has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a negative impact, this intervention {{is known as a}} nocebo (Latin nocebo = [...] "I shall harm").

2500|$|One {{example of}} a blind {{analysis}} occurs in neutrino experiments, like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, where the experimenters wish to report the total number N of neutrinos seen. The experimenters have preexisting expectations about what this number should be, and these expectations must {{not be allowed to}} bias the analysis. Therefore, the experimenters are allowed to see an unknown fraction f of the dataset. They use these data to understand the backgrounds, signal-detection efficiencies, detector resolutions, etc.. However, since no one knows the [...] "blinding fraction" [...] f, no one has preexisting <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> meaningless neutrino count N=N×f in the visible data; therefore, the analysis does not introduce any bias into the final number N which is reported. Another blinding scheme is used in B meson analyses in experiments like BaBar and CDF; here, the crucial experimental parameter is a correlation between certain particle energies and decay times—which require an extremely complex and painstaking analysis—and particle charge signs, which are fairly trivial to measure. Analysts are allowed to work with all the energy and decay data, but are forbidden from seeing the sign of the charge, and thus are unable to see the correlation (if any). At the end of the experiment, the correct charge signs are revealed; the analysis software is run once (with no subjective human intervention), and the resulting numbers are published. Searches for rare events, like electron neutrinos in MiniBooNE or proton decay in Super-Kamiokande, require a different class of blinding schemes.|$|E
60|$|The {{inductive}} principle, however, {{is equally}} incapable of being proved by {{an appeal to}} experience. Experience might conceivably confirm the inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already examined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle alone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what has not been examined. All arguments which, {{on the basis of}} experience, argue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or present, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use experience to prove the inductive principle without begging the question. Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our <b>expectations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future. If the principle is unsound, {{we have no reason to}} expect the sun to rise to-morrow, to expect bread to be more nourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off the roof we shall fall. When we see what looks like our best friend approaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not inhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. All our conduct is based upon associations which have worked in the past, and which we therefore regard as likely to work in the future; and this likelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.|$|E
