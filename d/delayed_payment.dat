5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, {{were opposed}} to any pitched battle and {{possibly}} offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming {{that it would take}} time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their <b>delayed</b> <b>payment,</b> a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigate}} the retailer’s optimal cycle time and optimal payment time under supplier credits including conditionally permissible <b>delay</b> in <b>payments</b> and cash discount depending on retailer payment time. That is, the retailer can obtain fully permissible <b>delay</b> in <b>payments</b> and cash discount if the payment is paid before {{the period of}} full <b>delay</b> <b>payments</b> permitted by the supplier. Otherwise, the retailer will just obtain partially permissible <b>delay</b> in <b>payments</b> within the period of partial <b>delay</b> <b>payments</b> permitted by the supplier. The supplier uses this policy to attract retailer to pay the payment {{as soon as possible}} to shorten its collection period. Mathematical models have been derived for obtaining the optimal cycle time and optimal payment time for item so that the annual total relevant cost is minimized. One theorem is developed to efficiently determine the optimal replenishment and payment policy for the retailer...|$|R

Shortly after, Boyko countered that Tymoshenko herself had been lobbying in the interests of business owners Igor Bakai and Viktor Medvedchuk.

25|$|Relations between 'Ali and Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah, {{the former}} {{governor}} for Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, had remained poor since the incident at Tustar. In an attempt to free himself from 'Ali, Muhammad wrote to Ankalay, {{the son of the}} Zanj leader, and asked that the district under his control be removed from 'Ali's jurisdiction and assigned directly to him. This deal angered 'Ali, and in retaliation he requested that Muhammad's tax revenues be transferred to him. When he received the Zanj leader's approval, he demanded the money from Muhammad, but the latter <b>delayed</b> <b>payment.</b> 'Ali used the delay as a pretext to attack Muhammad, and set out for Ramhurmuz where he way staying. Lacking the means to face 'Ali, Muhammad decided to flee, and Ramhurmuz was ransacked by 'Ali's troops. A panicked Muhammad decided to request a reconciliation with 'Ali, which the Zanj leader assented to. Muhammad then turned over his tax revenues to 'Ali, who in turn forwarded the money to al-Mukhtarah and agreed to keep his distance from the areas under Muhammad's control.|$|E
500|$|Thus began {{a bitter}} {{dispute between the}} two, {{involving}} many of their friends and Veronica's own sister. Lucan again began to watch his wife's movements. He recorded some of their telephone conversations with a small Sony tape recorder and played excerpts to any friends prepared to listen; he also told them—and his bank manager—that Lady Lucan had been [...] "spending money like water". He continued to pay her £40 a week and may have cancelled their regular food order with Harrods. He <b>delayed</b> <b>payment</b> to the milkman and—knowing that Veronica was required by the court to employ a live-in nanny—the childcare agency. With no income of her own, Veronica took a part-time job in a local hospital. A temporary nanny, Elizabeth Murphy, was befriended by Lucan, who bought her drinks and asked her for information on his wife. He instructed his detective agency to investigate Murphy, looking for evidence that she was failing in her duty of care to his children. This they found; he dispensed with the detective agency's services when they presented him with bills amounting to several hundred pounds. Murphy was later hospitalised with cancer. Another temporary nanny, Christabel Martin, reported strange telephone calls to the house, some with heavy breathing and some from a man asking for non-existent people. Following a series of temporary nannies, Sandra Rivett started work in late 1974.|$|E
