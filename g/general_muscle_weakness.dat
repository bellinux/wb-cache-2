25|$|The {{hydantoin}} derivative dantrolene is a spasmolytic {{agent with}} a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fiber. In normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. Dantrolene interferes {{with the release of}} calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of dantrolene include <b>general</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.|$|E

Autosomal dominant CNM {{is due to}} mutations in the large GTPase dynamin 2 (DNM 2), a mechanochemical enzyme regulating cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking in cells. To date, 40 families with CNM-related DNM 2 mutations have been described, and here we report 60 additional families encompassing a broad genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. In total, 18 different mutations are reported in 100 families and our cohort harbors nine known and four new mutations, including the first splice-site mutation. Genotype-phenotype correlation hypotheses are drawn from the published and new data, and allow an efficient screening strategy for molecular diagnosis. In addition to CNM, dissimilar DNM 2 mutations are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy (CMTD 1 B and CMT 2 M), suggesting a tissue-specific impact of the mutations. In this study, we discuss the possible clinical overlap of CNM and CMT, and the biological significance of the respective mutations based on the known functions of dynamin 2 and its protein structure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous {{group of}} inherited connective tissue disorders characterised by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility. It {{has recently been}} shown that <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> occurs frequently in EDS, and that fatigue is a common and clinically important symptom. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between fatigue severity and subjective and objective measures of <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness.</b> Furthermore, the predictive value of <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> for fatigue severity was determined, together with that of pain and physical activity. DESIGN: An explorative, cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty EDS patients, recruited from the Dutch patient association, were investigated at the neuromuscular outpatient department of a tertiary referral centre in The Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Muscle strength measured with manual muscle strength testing and hand-held dynamometry. Self-reported <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> pain, physical activity levels and fatigue were assessed with standardised questionnaires. RESULTS: Fatigue severity in EDS was significantly correlated with measured and self-reported <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> (r=- 0. 408 for manual muscle strength, r= 0. 461 for hand-held dynamometry and r= 0. 603 for self-reported <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness).</b> Both <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> and pain severity were significant predictors of fatigue severity in a multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a positive and direct relationship between fatigue severity and <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> in EDS.

40|$|Background: This case {{features}} an 18 -year-old female with glenohumeral dysrhythmia and subluxation-relocation patterns. This unusual case highlights {{the need for}} careful examination and consideration to the anatomical structures involved. Conventional approaches to shoulder examination include range of motion, orthopaedic tests and manual resistance tests. We also assessed the patient's cognitive ability to coordinate muscle function. With this type of assessment we found that co-contraction of local muscle groups seemed to initially improve the patients abnormal shoulder motion. With this information a rehabilitation method was instituted with a goal to maintain the improvement. Case presentation: An 18 -year-old female with no history of trauma, presented with painless kinesiopathology of the left shoulder (in abduction) consisting of dysrhythmia of the glenohumeral joint and early lateral rotation of the scapula. Examination also showed associated muscle atrophy of the lower trapezius and surrounding <b>general</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness.</b> We used an untested functional assessment method in addition to more conventional methods.

Conclusion: This paper presents an unusual case of aberrant shoulder movement. It highlights the need for careful examination and thought regarding the anatomical structures and normal motor patterns associated with the manoeuvre being tested. It also emphasised the use of co-contraction during examination in an attempt to immediately improve a regional dysrythmia if there is suspicion of a regional aberrant motor pattern.
