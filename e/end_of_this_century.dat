5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Slavic settlers {{from the}} east reached southeastern Poland {{in the second half}} of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper Silesia. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century,</b> or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania. According to the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, the Slavs captured in Constantinople in 592 named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place from which they originated.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Cluj {{suffered}} from great calamities, suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century</b> brought {{the end of}} Turkish sovereignty, but found the city bereft of much of its wealth, municipal freedom, cultural centrality, political significance and even population. It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as {{the headquarters of the}} Gubernium and the Diets between 1719 and 1732, and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848, when the Gubernium moved to Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt), present-day Sibiu). In 1791, a group of Romanian intellectuals drew up a petition, known as Supplex Libellus Valachorum, which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna. The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations (Saxon, Szekler and Hungarian) governed by the Unio Trium Nationum, but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj.|$|E

25|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 16th-century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (Chamber of rhetoric) {{organised}} contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was {{under the influence of}} German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly vaudeville and music-hall). The metronome, {{one of the most important}} advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century,</b> the Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk Museum were built. In 1888, the Concertgebouworkest was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in Hilversum and Aalsmeer, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch SBS Broadcasting Group is located in Amsterdam.|$|E
500|$|Even if the {{commencement}} of a formal earldom of Orkney {{is a matter of}} discussion (see above) there [...] is little doubt that the institution experienced continuity thereafter. Until the mid to late 11th century the Earls of Orkney and Kings of the Western Isles were probably independent rulers. The imposition of direct Norwegian rule at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century</b> brought this to a close in the north and [...] unusually, from c. 1100 onwards the Norse jarls of the Northern Isles owed allegiance both to Norway for Orkney and to the Scottish crown through their holdings as Earls of Caithness. In 1231 the line of Norse earls, unbroken since Rognvald Eysteinsson, ended with Jon Haraldsson's murder in Thurso. The Earldom of Caithness was granted to Magnus, second son of the Earl of Angus, whom Haakon IV of Norway confirmed as Earl of Orkney in 1236. In 1379 the earldom passed to the Sinclair family, who were also barons of Roslin near Edinburgh although Orkney and Shetland remained part of Norway for a century more.|$|E

2500|$|After the Mexican War of Independence, the Federal District of Mexico City was {{established}} {{as the new}} nation’s capital in 1824. The village of Iztapalapa became part of this district at the same time, but the borough {{had not yet been}} established. [...] It would remain an autonomous settlement. In 1828, {{it was one of the}} municipalities outside of Mexico City proper. [...] The rest of the 19th century would be concerned with disease and the status of the area’s water transportation. [...] A cholera epidemic in 1833 prompted the first passion play to be performed in this area, which has been performed since. In the middle of the 19th century, the town of Iztapalapa had 3,416 inhabitants. [...] Drainage of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico would have an effect on the size and arrangement of water transportation. According to records, the ancient “Calzada de los Indios” (Indian Causeway) that linked Iztapalapa and the Villa Guadalupe was destroyed in 1835. Much of what is now the borough was lake or crisscrossed by various canals, which carried barge, canoe and even steamship traffic until the late 19th century. New canals were dug to connect Mexico City with Peñón Viejo, Chalco and San Isidro as well as the villages of Ayotla, Tlapicahua and Tlapacoya. [...] By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century,</b> much of the lake and many of the small canals had dried. The main ones were the Mexicaltzingo canal and those near the Churubusco River. The Mexicalcingo canal was widened for steamships.|$|E
2500|$|Caesarea, on the seacoast just {{northwest}} of Jerusalem, at first Caesarea Maritima, then after 133 Caesarea Palaestina, {{was built by}} Herod the Great, c. 25–13 BC, and was the capital of Iudaea Province (6–132) and later Palaestina Prima. It was there that Peter baptized the centurion Cornelius, considered the first gentile convert. Paul sought refuge there, once staying {{at the house of}} Philip the Evangelist, and later being imprisoned there for two years (estimated to be 57–59). The Apostolic Constitutions (7.46) state that the first Bishop of Caesarea was Zacchaeus the Publican but the Catholic Encyclopedia claims that: [...] "...there is no record of any bishops of Caesarea until the second century. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century</b> a council was held there to regulate the celebration of Easter." [...] According to another Catholic Encyclopedia article, after Hadrian's siege of Jerusalem (c.133), Caesarea became the metropolitan see with the bishop of Jerusalem as one of its [...] "suffragans" [...] (subordinates). Origen (d.254) compiled his Hexapla there and it held a famous library and theological school, St. Pamphilus (d.309) was a noted scholar-priest. St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker (d.270), St. Basil the Great (d.379), and St. Jerome (d.420) visited and studied at the library which was later destroyed, probably by the Persians in 614 or the Saracens around 637. The first major church historian, Eusebius of Caesarea, was a bishop, c. 314–339. F. J. A. Hort and Adolf von Harnack have argued that the Nicene Creed originated in Caesarea. The Caesarean text-type is recognized by many textual scholars as one of the earliest New Testament types.|$|E
