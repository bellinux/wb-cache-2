It will be this hedging aspect of interest rate futures markets on which the following research is concentrated. The main points to be investigated are: - to what extent interest rate risk is reduced or even abolished, - the effects of futures trading in <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>securities</b> on risk and return of single assets and portfolios, - the consequences on the situation of participants in capital markets, - optimal strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk.

Econ., 80, 413 – 435) formulate a cash management model under which an organization’s cash flow evolves in terms of a stationary random walk. This, in turn, implies that the organization’s demand for cash will not grow over time. However, as organizations grow one would expect the demand for cash to grow as well. Given this, we formulate a cash management model under which movements in an organization’s cash balance hinge on its current rate of output or an equivalent size measure. Cash is withdrawn and invested in <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>securities</b> when the cash to output ratio becomes too high, while securities are sold and the proceeds deposited in a non-interest-bearing bank account when the cash to output ratio becomes too low. The control limits are determined so as to minimize the expected annual cost of a unit of output. Our analysis shows that when organization’s cash flows follow a non-stationary process, the optimal cash management policies are profoundly different to those obtained under the Miller & Orr (1966) model...|$|R

However, the ratio can be more discerning as to what is actually a borrowing, as opposed to other types of obligations that might exist on the balance sheet under the liabilities section. For example, often only the liabilities accounts that are actually labelled as [...] "debt" [...] on the balance sheet are used in the numerator, instead of the broader category of [...] "total liabilities". In other words, actual borrowings like bank loans and <b>interest-bearing</b> debt <b>securities</b> are used, as opposed to the broadly inclusive category of total liabilities which, in addition to debt-labelled accounts, can include accrual accounts like unearned revenue.|$|R
40|$|The {{subprime}} mortgage {{crisis that}} began in 2007 has given the decades-old concept of securitization a bad name. Securitization is the process in which certain types of assets are pooled {{so that they can}} be repackaged into <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>securities.</b> The interest and principal payments from the assets are passed through to the purchasers of the securities. Securitization got its start in the 1970 s, when home mortgages were pooled by U. S. government-backed agencies. Starting in the 1980 s, other income-producing assets began to be securitized, and in recent years the market has grown dramatically. In some markets, such as those for securities backed by risky subprime mortgages in the United States, the unexpected deterioration in the quality of some of the underlying assets undermined investor confidence. Both the scale and persistence of the attendant credit crisis seem to suggest that securitization—together with poor credit origination, inadequate valuation methods, and insufficient regulatory oversight—could severely hurt financial stability. Increasing numbers of financial institutions employ securitization to transfer the credit risk of the assets they originate from their balance sheets to those of other financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, and hedge funds. Author: B 2 B, 6 / 28 / 08 They do it for a variety reasons. It is often Proof cheaper to raise money through securitization, and securitized assets were then less costly for banks to hold because financial regulators had different standards for them than for the assets that underpinned them. In principle, this “originate and distribute ” approach brought broad economic benefits too—spreading out credit exposures, thereby diffusing risk concentrations and reducing systemic vulnerabilities. Until the subprime crisis unfolded, the impact of securitization appeared largely to be positive and benign. But securitization also has been indicted by some for compromising the incentives for originators to ensure minimum standards of prudent lending, risk management, and investment, at a time when low returns on conventional Asset originator Underlying asset...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. It {{is settled}} law that the trustee of any trust is {{unequivocally}} {{charged with the}} duty to invest {{the assets of the}} trust. However, in south Africa in the past, this duty has been qualified, with avoidance of risk seen as the trustee's number one priority when investing. The legislature and the judiciary focused on providing safeguards for beneficiaries and trustees were to avoid all risk to the capital of the trust. This reflected the attitude of the 19 th and first half of the 20 th century when the value of money had remained steady over long periods and inflation was non-existent. However, changes began to occur in world economics, such as the devaluing of currencies and progressive inflation. Despite these harsh economic realities, the courts continued for some considerable time to favour investment in <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>securities.</b> Most of the time trustees erred on the side of caution, following the judiciary's lead. Unfortunately, as it will be pointed out, this meant that the trustees were blind to their primary task, which is and always has been, to do the best for the beneficiaries. Trustees will have to expose the assets to at least some risk in order to outperform inflation, as the traditional investments are no longer suitable. This change in investment thinking was confirmed in South Africa in Administrators, Estate Richards v Nicol and Another 1999 1 SA 551 (SCA). Every trustee is, therefore, faced with a dilemma when engaging in investment decision making. He or she is under a duty to invest with the minimum of risk and also to balance the interests of competing beneficiaries. The trustee is under a duty to balance the risk against the rewards, always bearing in mind that he or she must "preserve the trust fund rather than overtly seek its advancement". Any exercise of the duty to invest will be limited by the provisions contained in the trust instrument as well as those provided for by statute, particularly the duty of care. Change occurred in English Trust Law with the introduction of the Trustee Act, 2000. The Trustee Act removes the constraints of the previous legislation and imposes positive obligations on trustees in their place, which reflect the reality of modern investment practices. Under section 1 of the Trustee Act a new uniform duty of care is created to guide trustees when performing their functions under the Act or a trust instrument. This uniformity is aimed at providing certainty and consistency in respect of the standard of competence and behaviour expected of trustees in all situations. The statutory duty of care is founded on the premise that there is a baseline standard of care expected of all trustees when investing trust assets. This standard is that of the "reasonable trustee", as referred to in section 1 (1) of the Trustee Act. The law in South Africa does not provide sufficient guidance for trustees, particularly in the area of trustee investment. It could certainly benefit from the sort of review that led to the changes in the English law. Master...|$|R
