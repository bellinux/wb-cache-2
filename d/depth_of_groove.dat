40|$|Mechanical {{responses}} of three gamma titanium aluminides (TiAls) (denoted as Alloy A, Alloy B and Alloy C) subjected to dynamic scratching were studied {{by using a}} single-grit pendulum (rotating) scratch tester. The maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> was {approx} 0. 07 mm, and the scratch velocity was {approx} 1. 0 m/s. Normal and tangential forces were monitored. The material removal mechanisms were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the scratches were measured by using a laser profilometer. The mechanical properties of the tested TiAls were characterized by the instantaneous specific energy, scratch resistance and scratch hardness as related to the groove depth. Extensive thermal softening was observed in the dynamic scratch test of the TiAls, which facilitated both the detachment of developing chips and pile-up of material on side ridges. Sizable fractures were observed in the transverse direction in the tested TiAls; these fractures tended {{to participate in the}} chip formation, depending on the microstructure of the TiAl {{and the size of the}} scratch groove. Specific energy and scratch hardness are depth-dependent to various degrees for the TiAls tested. The material removal might be subjected to different mechanisms, but the overall material response can be effectively characterized by the HEM (Hwang, Evans and Malkin) model and the PSR (proportional specimen resistance) model. The depth-independent specific energy and scratch hardness can be used to screen candidate materials for the applications that are scratch-dominated versus impact-dominated. Among the three tested TiAls, the TiAl with larger colony or grain size exhibits a stronger capability of energy dissipation during material removal (higher depth-independent specific energy), while the TiAl with smaller colony size shows a higher resistance to indentation (higher depth-independent scratch hardness). The observations and conclusions in this study can serve as a base line for the further characterization of the related materials under the service temperature as recommended for diesel engine...|$|E

It is found that, by systematically increasing the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove,</b> the linearly polarized emission at particular frequencies can be substantially enhanced to achieve that of the blackbody radiation limit, whereas the emission in other frequency ranges shows no noticeable changes. The results can provide useful insights into the design of thermovoltaic applications...|$|R

40|$|Novel die-stacking schema using through-wafer vias {{may require}} thick {{electrodeposited}} copper and aggressive first-step {{chemical mechanical planarization}} (CMP). However, the effect of microstructural parameters, including surface orientation and grain size, on the CMP behavior of thick electrodeposited copper is not well understood. Here we explore {{the relationship between the}} surface orientation of copper grains and local CMP removal parameters using electron backscatter diffraction and topography correlation techniques. In the present work, solid copper disks are studied which are annealed to produce samples with differing grain sizes. In addition, aggressive CMP is performed on copper films (30 μm) electrodeposited on silicon. At the bulk level, the slurry composition is found to have the greatest effect on the removal rate and surface roughness. At the microstructural level, the nature of the grain boundaries (e. g. coincidence site lattice (CSL) vs. non-CSL boundaries) is shown to impact the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooving</b> at the grain boundaries. A relationship between surface orientation and local removal rate is found...|$|R
40|$|The spiral-grooved seal {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for application to liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopumps. A theoretical model of double spiral–grooved seals dealing with the viscosity–temperature relation is presented. The effect of operating parameters (rotational speed, supply pressure) and configurative parameters (<b>depth</b> <b>of</b> spiral <b>groove)</b> on the basic static characteristics (opening force, leakage, static friction torque, face temperature, and power loss) of double spiral–grooved seals are examined. Comparisons are presented between measurements and theoretical predications for a narrow spiral-grooved face seal with an average diameter of 100 mm, operating at high speed and using water as a test fluid. The theoretical and experimental {{results indicate that the}} temperature on seal faces rises and friction torque increases with the speed and supply pressure, and these increases vary slightly with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the spiral <b>groove.</b> These findings lend great theoretical and experimental insights to the design of face seals applied in liquid engine turbopumps...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that single-mode {{operation of a}} sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguide {{in the form of}} a V-groove on a metal surface can be achieved by adjusting <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove.</b> Strongly localized channel plasmon-polaritons (CPPs) are shown to propagate in such waveguides. If the groove depth is close to the penetration <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the fundamental CPP mode, then all higher modes are not supported by the structure, leaving only the fundamental mode propagating in the groove. In this case, propagation distances of fundamental mode ~ 10 micron can easily be achieved together with strong sub-wavelength localization...|$|R

This method overcomes the limitations of simply measuring interstrand phosphate-phosphate distances and {{has the advantage of}} yielding continuous values for groove geometry along a DNA fragment. In the case of oligonucleotides, it also clearly indicates the zones in which grooves exist, bounded by two phosphodiester backbones. The methodology has been developed within the Curves algorithm for studying irregular DNA geometries and is based on the optimal, and generally curved, helical axis obtained by this analysis.
