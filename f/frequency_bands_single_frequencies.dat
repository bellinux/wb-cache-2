40|$|Rapid {{technological}} change and increasing traffic volumes worldwide are {{adding to the}} safety challenges for air traffic control. The night shift has traditionally been a period of low workload and work practices have evolved to reflect this. Thus, despite the exemplary safety record, {{there is a need}} to consider further systemic defences for maintaining performance and safety on the night shift. One possible strategy is the provision of a scheduled nap at work. In order to investigate the consequences of a scheduled nap on the night shift, 28 operational air traffic controllers were monitored across four roster cycles. Each roster cycle included one of two night shifts. Air traffic controllers were given a nap opportunity on one night shift of each type, and did not nap on the other. Information on the timing, quantity, and quality of sleep during the work week and days off was collected using actigraphy, and supported with logbook data. Sleep during the nap was measured using polysomnography, and the EEG and EOG were further utilised to determine neurophysiological alertness over the latter part of the night shift. Reaction time performance was measured three times across the night shift (beginning, middle, and end) with the psychomotor vigilance test. Actigraphy data indicated that the backward, rapidly-rotating work schedule of air traffic controllers resulted in a progressive loss of sleep across the work week. The reduction in sleep lead to an increasing cumulative sleep debt that was at a maximum prior to the night shift. This sleep debt was not related to reaction time performance at the end of the night shift, but was found to influence neurophysiological alertness. It was determined that the large majority of air traffic controllers were able to sleep during the scheduled 40 minute nap opportunity. However, the latency to sleep onset was long, the sleep short, and of relatively poor quality. Circadian and homeostatic factors increased the likelihood of entry into, and waking from, slow wave sleep (SWS). They were also found to influence reaction time performance and neurophysiological alertness. More variable performance and lowered alertness were seen at the end of the later starting (and finishing) night shift, possibly due to the combined influence of circadian and time-on-task factors. Homeostatic variables had less influence on performance at the end of the night shift, but greater acute sleep loss and higher cumulative sleep debts were related to increased neurophysiological sleepiness. performance and greater neurophysiological alertness in a dose-dependent manner, with even small amounts of stage 1 sleep effecting a performance improvement. Performance improvement was consistent across a range of reaction time measures and consistent improvements were also evident in the neurophysiological data, with the occurrence of SEMs declining, and lower spectral power evident in all <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> and <b>single</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These findings clearly demonstrate that a minimal quantity of sleep benefits the performance and alertness of air traffic controllers despite the "noise" of a field setting, thus providing a link between laboratory studies of napping and the actual work environment. The findings also fully support management endorsing a 40 minute napping opportunity for air traffic controllers working the night shift. The short nap sleep had no measurable effect on sleep subsequent to the night shift. However, the amount of sleep obtained in the nap was related to improved reaction time...|$|R

By sensing and adapting to its environment, such a device is able to fill voids in the wireless spectrum and can dramatically increase spectral efficiency. In this paper, the cognitive radio channel {{is defined as a}} 2 sender, 2 receiver interference channel in which sender 2 obtains the encoded message sender 1 plans to transmit. We consider two cases: in the genie aided cognitive radio channel, sender 2 is non-causally presented the data to be transmitted by sender 1 while in the causal cognitive radio channel, the data is obtained causally. The cognitive radio at sender 2 may then choose to simultaneously transmit over the same channel, as opposed to waiting for an idle channel as is traditional for a cognitive radio. Our main result is the development of an achievable region which combines Gel’fand-Pinkser coding with an achievable region construction for the interference channel. In the additive Gaussian noise case this resembles dirty paper coding, a technique used in the computation of the capacity of the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Numerical evaluation of the region in the Gaussian noise case is performed, and compared to an inner bound, the interference channel, and an outer bound, a modified Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Results are also extended to the case in which the message is causally obtained.

50|$|Active {{speakers}} comprise two {{or three}} speakers per channel, each fitted with its own amplifier, and preceded by an electronic crossover filter to separate the low-level audio signal into the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> to be handled by each speaker. This approach enables complex active filters to be used on the low level signal, without the need to use passive crossovers of high power handling capability but limited rolloff and with large and expensive inductors and capacitors. An additional advantage is that peak power handling is greater if the signal has simultaneous peaks in two different <b>frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> A <b>single</b> amplifier has to handle the peak power when both signal voltages are at their crest; as power {{is proportional to the}} square of voltage, the peak power when both signals are at the same peak voltage is proportional to the square of the sum of the voltages. If separate amplifiers are used, each must handle the square of the peak voltage in its own band. For example, if bass and midrange each has a signal corresponding to 10 W of output, a single amplifier capable of handling a 40 W peak would be needed, but a bass and a treble amplifier each capable of handling 10 W would be sufficient. This is relevant when peaks of comparable amplitude occur in different <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> as with wideband percussion and high-amplitude bass notes.|$|R

The main advantages of the developed new method over existing Diagnosis techniques are the following: -	Capability of monitoring the fault evolution continuously over time under any transient operating condition; -	Speed/slip measurement or estimation is not required; -	Higher accuracy in filtering frequency components around the fundamental in case of rotor faults; -	Reduction in the likelihood of false indications by avoiding confusion with other fault harmonics (the contribution of the most relevant fault frequency components under speed-varying conditions are clamped in a <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> band); -	Low memory requirement due to low sampling frequency; -	Reduction in the latency of time processing (no requirement of repeated sampling operation). ...|$|R
