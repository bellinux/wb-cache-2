500|$|Roberts {{formed a}} {{formidable}} centre-back pairing with Jon Ashton the following {{season as the}} team started putting a decent run of form together during late August and throughout September 2009; with the defence being particularly tight. He scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season on his 50th appearance for the club, giving Stevenage the lead in a 3–1 victory over Salisbury City in October 2009. A month later, he doubled his goal tally, scoring the second goal in Stevenage's 2–0 victory against Chester City, before notching his third goal {{of the season in}} a 6–0 win over Vauxhall Motors in the FA Trophy. Roberts' fourth goal of the campaign came during another 6–0 win, this time at Eastbourne Borough, side-footing the ball into the net from a well-worked free-kick. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow, sliding the ball into the net from close range. Roberts led the side out in their 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010; the game that ultimately secured promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history, winning the league with two games to spare. Roberts played a total of 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. Stevenage had the best defensive record in the league, conceding just 24 goals in 46 league matches, as well as ending the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceding just two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage. On signing the new deal, Roberts said [...] "there was never any doubt that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, I love the club and love the fans. It will be a privilege to lead the team in the Football League". At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Scott Laird.|$|E
2500|$|He {{became a}} notable player {{after he took}} a {{successful}} catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen on the 4th day of the first Test between England and Australia. Sabburg was fielding at fine leg for only two deliveries when Ryan Harris left the field for a short time. Pietersen hit a short ball from Mitchell Johnson towards fine leg where it was caught by Sabburg sprinting from the boundary to secure a catch. Pietersen was dismissed for 26 and Australia {{went on to win}} the game by 381 runs. Sabburg said after the game: [...] "It wasn't a very hard catch, to be honest. I just had to do the simple things and catch it. All the boys got around so it was pretty awesome. I was hoping 'Harry' was going to stay off … <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on." [...] It also was not the first time substitute fielders were notably used in a Test between England and Australia. In 2005 at Trent Bridge England's substitute fielder Gary Pratt famously ran out Ricky Ponting.|$|E

6000|$|I knew {{quite well}} why Father {{sent me to}} Prince Edward Island to visit Aunt Philippa that summer. He {{told me he was}} sending me there [...] "to learn some sense"; and my stepmother, of whom I was very fond, told me she was sure the sea air would do me a world of good. I did not want to learn sense or be done a world of good; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Montreal and go on being foolish--and make up my quarrel with Mark Fenwick.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Carleton. I {{loved the}} big, straggling, bustling little town that always {{reminded}} me of a lanky, overgrown schoolboy, all arms and legs, but full to the brim with enthusiasm and splendid ideas. I knew Carleton was bound to grow into a magnificent city, and I wanted to be there and see it grow and watch it develop; and I loved the whole big, breezy golden west, with the rush and tingle of its young life. And, more than all, I loved my boys, and what I was going to do without them or they without me was more than I knew, though I tried to think Providence might know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I loved Surprise Valley. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> there always. I remembered Cottonwoods, how the {{children}} there hated me, and I didn't {{want to go}} back. The only unhappy times I ever had in the valley were when Ring and Whitie, my dogs, grew old and died. I roamed the valley. I climbed to every nook upon the mossy ledges. I learned to run up the steep cliffs. I could almost stick on the straight walls. Mother Jane called me a wild girl. We had put away the clothes we wore when we got there, to save them, and we made clothes of skins. I always laughed when I thought of my little dress--how I grew out of it. I think Uncle Jim and Mother Jane talked less {{as the years went}} by. And after I'd learned all she could teach me we didn't talk much. I used to scream into the caves just to hear my voice, and the echoes would frighten me.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next morning}} early I {{went to the}} village to find the [...] "Kapala," [...] or head man. I {{informed}} him that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{a few days in}} the house at the landing, and begged him to have it made ready for me. He was very civil, and came down at once to get it cleared, when we found that the traders had already left, on hearing that I required it. There were no doors to it, so I obtained the loan of a couple of hurdles to keep out dogs and other animals. The land here was evidently sinking rapidly, as shown by the number of trees standing in salt water dead and dying. After breakfast I started for a walk to the forest-covered hill above the village, with a couple of boys as guides. It was exceedingly hot and dry, no rain having fallen for two months. When we reached an elevation of about two hundred feet, the coralline rock which fringes the shore was succeeded by a hard crystalline rock, a kind of metamorphic sandstone. This would indicate flat there had been a recent elevation of more than two hundred feet, which had still more recently clanged into a movement of subsidence. The hill was very rugged, but among dry sticks and fallen trees I found some good insects, mostly of forms and species I was already acquainted with from Ternate and Gilolo. Finding no good paths I returned, and explored the lower ground eastward of the village, passing through a long range of plantain and tobacco grounds, encumbered with felled and burnt logs, on which I found quantities of beetles of the family Buprestidae of six different species, one of which was new to me. I then reached a path in the swampy forest where I hoped to find some butterflies, but was disappointed. Being now pretty well exhausted by the intense heat, I thought it wise to return and reserve further exploration for the next day.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you know}} we might yield the palm, and that Lucerne is far finer than any of our Italian lakes? Even Robert had to confess it at once. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Switzerland, but we found it wiser to hasten our steps and come to Paris; so we came. Yes, and we {{travelled}} from Strasburg to Paris in four-and-twenty hours, night and day, never stopping except {{for a quarter of}} an hour's breakfast and half an hour's dinner. So afraid I was of the fatigue for Wiedeman! But between the unfinished railroad and the diligence, there's a complication of risks of losing places just now, and we were forced to go the whole way in a breath or to hazard being three or four days on the road. So we took the coupé and resigned ourselves, and poor little babe slept at night and laughed in the day, and came into Paris as fresh in spirit as if just alighted from the morning star, screaming out with delight at the shops! Think of that child! Upon the whole he has enjoyed our journey as much as any one of us, observing and admiring; though Robert and Wilson will have it that some of his admiration of the scenery we passed through was pure affectation and acted out to copy ours. He cried out, clasping his hands, that the mountains were 'due'--meaning a great number. His love of beautiful buildings, of churches especially, no one can doubt about. When first he saw St. Mark's, he threw up his arms in wonder, and then, clasping them round Wilson's neck (she was carrying him), he kissed her in an ecstasy of joy. And that was after a long day's journey, when most other children would have been tired and fretful. But the sense of the beautiful is certainly very strong in him, little darling. He can't say the word 'church' yet, but when he sees one he begins to chant. Oh, he's a true Florentine in some things.|$|E
60|$|Ethel. Oh, no, no! And {{yet it is}} not {{his fault}} or ours {{that he is a}} {{stranger}} to us. He used to be all day at the bank, or at night in the House of Commons, or he and mamma went to parties, and we young ones remained with the governess. Mamma is very kind. I have never, almost, known her angry; never with us; about us, sometimes, with the servants. As children, we used to see papa and mamma at breakfast; and then when she was dressing to go out. Since he has been ill, she has given up all parties. I wanted to do so too. I feel ashamed in the world, sometimes, when I think of my poor father at home, alone. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> but my mother and my grandmother forbade me. Grandmamma has a fortune, which she says I am to have: since then they have insisted on my being with her. She is very clever you know: she is kind too in her way; but she cannot live out of society. And I, who pretend to revolt, I like it too; and I, who rail and scorn flatterers--oh, I like admiration! I am pleased when the women hate me, and the young men leave them for me. Though I despise many of these, yet I can't help drawing them towards me. One or two of them I have seen unhappy about me, and I like it; and if they are indifferent I am angry, and never tire till they come back. I love beautiful dresses; I love jewels; I love a great name and a fine house--oh, I despise myself, when I think of these things! When I lie in bed and say I have been heartless and a coquette, I cry with humiliation; and then rebel and say, Why not?--and to-night--yes, to-night--after leaving you, I shall be wicked, I know I shall.|$|E
