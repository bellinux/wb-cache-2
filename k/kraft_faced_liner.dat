Small specimens of 80 - and 40 -pct-Al 2 O 3 brick and 95 -pct-SiO 2 brick were exposed to steam in high-pressure furnaces at pressures of up to 1, 000 deg and temperatures up to 1, 400 deg C for periods ranging up to 120 h. Weight losses from the 40 -pct-A 12 O 3 brick after 40 h of exposure were highest, 2. 75 pct at 1, 400 deg C and 1, 00 psig. The rate of weight loss had dropped to near zero after 80 h of exposure at all temperatures. No relationship between total silica content of the specimen and weight loss could be established nor did scanning electron microscopic examination of the specimens before and after exposure identify specific regions (e. g., surface) suffering {{a disproportionate share of}} the silica loss. It was concluded that minor silica volatilization is likely to occur, if at all, at temperatures of less than 1, 000 deg C and pressures below 1, 000 psig, and that low-alumina refractories should be used as dry-ash coal gasifier hot face linings.

This paper is concerned with coordinating {{the decisions of the}} assignment of ships to contractual and spot voyages, and the determination of ship routes and schedules in order to maximize profit. We propose a new model for representing voyages as nodes of a directed graph. which is used to build a mixed integer programming formulation. Besides contractual and spot nodes, another type of node is put forward to represent a combination of a contractual voyage with one or more spot voyages. In addition, the concept of dominated nodes is introduced in order to discard them and reduce the effort of the search for an optimal solution. A set of test problems has been generated taking into account real world assumptions. The test problems are solved by an optimization software and computational results are reported. The results show the potential of the approach to solve test problems of moderate size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, these trades are typically imbalanced {{in terms of the}} numbers of inbound and outbound containers. As a result, the relocation of empty containers {{has become one of the}} major problems <b>faced</b> by <b>liner</b> operators. In this paper, we consider the dynamic empty container allocation problem where we need to reposition empty containers and to determine the number of leased containers needed to meet customers' demand over time. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic network: in, stage one, the parameters such as supplies, demands, and ship capacities for empty containers are deterministic; whereas in stage two, these parameters are random variables. We need to make decisions in stage one such that the total of the stage one cost and the expected stage two cost is minimized. By taking advantage of the network structure, we show how a stochastic quasi-gradient method and a stochastic hybrid approximation procedure can be applied to solve the problem. In addition, we propose some new variations of these methods that seem to work faster in practice. We conduct numerical tests to evaluate the value of the two-stage stochastic model over a rolling horizon environment and to investigate the behavior of the solution, methods with different implementations...|$|R

The concept in thispaper aims on {{the improvement of the}} broadband damping compared to the narrow damping behavior of conventional Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) liner. This study investi- gates a new liner concept based on an additional acoustical excitation of the liner cavity below the <b>liner</b> <b>face</b> sheet. This so-called Zero-Mass ow-liner (ZML) concept was investigated earlier in the framework of combustion chamber liner design. Here, this concept was enhanced by combining a single cavity ZML liner with a honeycomb-structured SDOF liner yielding a hybrid ZML liner concept. Within this work, this concept was investigated in detail focusing on different parameters like the cavity excitation amplitude, the face sheet porosity and the grazing flow in uence. In conclusion, the hybrid ZML concept reveals a signiffcant potential for increased broadband dissipation behavior due to an additional damping effect based on the periodically excited flow through the liner facesheet...|$|R

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to determine {{the magnitude of the}} energy savings brought about by installing radiant barriers in the attics of single-family houses. The radiant barrier used for this test was a product with two reflective aluminum surfaces on a kraft paper base. The radiant barrier has the potential to reduce the radiant heat transfer component impinging on the fiberglass attic insulation. Working as a system in conjunction with an air space, the radiant barrier could theoretically block up to 95 % of far-infrared radiation heat transfer. The experiment was conducted in three unoccupied research houses that are operated by ORNL. One house was used as the control house (no barrier was installed), while the other two were used to test the two different methods for installing the radiant barriers. In one house, the barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass batt insulation, and in the other house, the barrier was attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The attics of all three houses were insulated with <b>kraft</b> paper <b>faced</b> nominal R- 19 fiberglass batt insulation. The results showed a savings in the cooling loads of 21 % when the radiant barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation and 13 % with the radiant barrier attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The savings in electrical consumption was 17 % and 9 %, respectively. The electrical consumption data and the cooling load data indicated that the most effective way of installing the foil was to lay it on top of the fiberglass batt insulation. The radiant barriers reduced the measured peak ceiling heat fluxes by 39 % for the case where the barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation. The radiant barrier reduced the integrated heat flows from the attic to house by approximately 30 - 35 % over a 7 -day time period...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new three-dimensional (3 D) analysis of tonal noise radiated from non-axisymmetric turbofan inlets. The novelty {{of the method}} is in combining a standard finite element discretisation of the acoustic field in the axial and radial coordinates with a Fourier spectral representation in the circumferential direction. The boundary conditions at the farfield, fan <b>face</b> and acoustic <b>liners</b> are treated using the same spectral representation. The resulting set of discrete acoustic equations are solved employing the well-established BICGSTAB or QMR iterative algorithms and a very effective specialised preconditioner based on the axisymmetric mean geometry and flow field. Numerical examples demonstrate the suitability of the new method to engine configurations with realistic 3 D features, such as relatively large degrees of asymmetry and spliced acoustic liners. The examples also illustrate the two advantages of the new method over a traditional 3 D finite element approach. The new method requires a significantly smaller number of unknowns as relatively few circumferential Fourier modes in the spectral solution ensure an accurate field representation. Also, due to the effective preconditioner, the spectral linear solver benefits from stable iterations at {{a high rate of}} convergence. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{simultaneous}} use of aerogel and phase change material (PCM) {{on the face}} cloth of thermal liner in firefighter&# 039;s protective garment. Aerogel is commonly used to resist incoming heat flux {{in the field of}} high heat protection and to prevent the loss of body heat in the cold environment clothing. In high heat protection clothing, aerogel not only resists the incoming heat fluxes but also blocks the outbound body heat. As a result the wearer suffers from internal increase of body temperature. Previous studies identified the potential use of aerogel in firefighter&# 039;s protective clothing. However there was no clear approach to resolve the problem associated with body heat release. Current study focuses on the problem by applying PCM along with aerogel on fabric. The ambient-side of a thermal <b>liner</b> <b>face</b> cloth was coated with silica aerogel particles; meanwhile, the next to skin side was coated with PCM/aerogel composite powder. The new thermal liner revealed superior thermal protection and comfort. It extended the time to reach pain threshold and increased the pain alarm time.

Scanning electron microscope, air permeability tester, and jPOR macro of ImageJ software were used for the surface characteristics and porosity analysis of coated liner.

40|$|Slender well {{drilling}} {{is a method}} that drills smaller holes and is more economical than conventional drilling due {{to the use of}} smaller equipment and rigs. Using the different tools for drilling slender wells, such as expandable reamers and expandable liners means that very deep wells can be drilled. If unexpected problems such as lost circulation or over pressured zones are <b>faced,</b> an expandable <b>liner</b> can be set. This type of solution imply very little or non- loss in diameter of the section. Reducing the amount of drill cuttings, steel, mud and cement means that less storage space is needed on the rig. Less storage needs means that a smaller and lower cost rig can be used. Using smaller equipment will also reduce the risk of the operations because the equipment is easier to handle during drilling and lifting operations. Avoiding the largest hole sizes and drilling more holes in the optimum range for ROP will reduce drilling time. There can also be some disadvantages with drilling slender wells. The equipment will be weaker if small holes are drilled, {{this is due to the}} small size of the equipment. In addition to this, hole cleaning can be a problem if mostly liners are used in the well and the well thereby have an upper sections with diameter that is significantly larger than the lower sections, since this will cause a large difference in the annular velocity of mud. The main objective with the thesis is to investigate the potential of using slender wells for exploration and production, as well as giving an overview of slender wells and how they are drilled. The work includes well construction, casing design and hydraulic calculations. The slender well designs are then to be compared with the conventional well design by looking at material savings. Pressure data from a high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) field in the North Sea was used. One of the objectives was to design a slender exploration well for 15 000 psi pressure rating. In addition to this a slender exploration well and a slender production well were designed using a water depth of 360 m. Based in the investigation slender well designs are feasible. The slender exploration wells are drilled in 5 sections, using a riser with an ID of 8 5 / 8 ” and an 11 ” wellhead (WH) and BOP. A 20 ” conductor casing is set, followed by an 11 3 / 4 ” surface casing with an 8 5 / 8 ” PIL. Then a 7 ” liner is set, before the well is drilled through the reservoir using a 5 7 / 8 ” drill bit. In the slender production well, an extra casing point is added to the well compared to the conventional well design, this allows more complicated wells to be drilled, or to cope with unexpected drilling problems. For drilling the slender exploration well, a riser with an ID of 12 1 / 2 " is used together with an 11 ” WH and BOP. The surface casing has a diameter of 20 ”, followed by a 14 ” surface casing with a 10 3 / 4 ” PIL. An 8 5 / 8 ” liner is set below the 10 3 / 4 " PIL. To maintain pressure integrity we install an 8 5 / 8 x 6 5 / 8 ” casing in the next section to isolate the liners, before the well is drilled to target depth (TD) where a 4 1 / 2 " liner is set. The volume of drill cuttings from drilling the slender exploration well was reduced by 61, 1 % compared to the conventional well. For the slender production well, the reduction was 53, 5 %. The volume of steel for casings and liners in the well was reduced by 59, 1 % for the exploration well and 20, 1 % for the production compared to conventional well design. The mud volume needed in the well was reduced by 53, 2 % for the slender exploration well compared to the conventional well, for the slender exploration well, the reduction in mud volume was 45, 2 %. Further focus should be on well completion equipment for 15 K pressure rating. This include expandable liner hanger, wellhead, BOP etc. A comparison of equipment for 10 K versus 15 K would have been of interest. Another important aspect is the time and cost saving from drilling slender wells. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{aluminium}} extrusion process {{is based on}} simple principles, but allows profiles with the most complex cross-sectional shapes to be produced {{at a very high}} rate. One of the greatest challenges of {{aluminium extrusion}} is to control material flow and dimensional variability of thin-walled high-strength profiles, for which the demand is growing. The die outlet geometry and the temperatures of the billet and tools must be carefully tuned in order to secure satisfactory material flow conditions. Due to the high pressures in the container, the deformation of the extrusion dies and the distortion of the die outlet may be significant and must be compensated for. The thermal conditions in the extrusion press must also be controlled. Even in the age of numerical modelling much trial and error is needed to make certain that the product satisfies the customer requirements. If simple and effective process control could be implemented, the cost and dimensional variability of extruded profiles could be significantly reduced. This would not only secure the continued use of extruded profiles in old markets but also open new ones. The main objective of this study has been to establish useful and simple methods for measuring the pressure at the interface between the die and the billet and the deformation of the die during hot extrusion of aluminium. Pressure measurement data may be used to establish {{a better understanding of the}} extrusion process and to carefully evaluate the many numerical extrusion models that are presently being developed and refined for the purpose of predicting profile shape and properties. A most important task is the evaluation of constitutive models used to describe bulk material and friction behaviour. The requirements for such models should be viewed in relation to common flow instability phenomena such as buckling. Sensors may in the future be integrated in intelligent extrusion dies in order to make certain that temperature and flow condition changes are as small as possible and to prevent overloading of extrusion dies during production. It is of the utmost importance that dimensional variability is detected early. This study has consisted of many parts. The first step was a careful evaluation of sensor designs using the Capacitec HPC- 75 high-temperature capacitive displacement probes and the Capacitec 4004 amplifier series. The feasibility of high- and low-temperature pressure measurement was demonstrated through various types of compression testing. The capacitive sensors were repeatedly tested in a hot air furnace to 650 ºC, and results were satisfactory for all but one of the sensors. The sensor sensitivity to temperature changes that occur during extrusion is usually less than 10 % of the full sensor response. The pressure sensors have been repeatedly tested in several dies for aluminium rod extrusion. The feasibility of, and a method for, performing useful measurements in the high-temperature extrusion environment have been demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is better than ± 10 % of full scale of 200 MPa when the effects of temperature changes are compensated for. The measurement repeatability is of a similar magnitude for genuinely replicated measurements. The measurement resolution is better than 1 %. It is firmly believed that the measurement and calibration technology may be further improved, and that the measurement accuracy may be better than 5 % of full scale. Rod extrusion experiments allowed the quality of the finite element modelling approach to be evaluated. The code ALMA 2 π was used, and material data of the Zener-Hollomon flow rule have been obtained by compression testing. Simulated and measured results of the ram force, die <b>face</b> pressure and <b>liner</b> force generally differed less than 10 %. The estimated die outlet temperature change was systematically 10 ºC too high. As there are significant differences between extrusion and compression testing, the use of material data from compression testing amounts to an extrapolation of data. Experiments did not demonstrate that the approach is unacceptable, but plots showing the deviation between experimental and estimated ram force and outlet temperature data indicated that there are a number of parameter combinations that are equally good as or even better than those obtained through compression testing. Very high accuracy determination of flow parameters may be difficult. Measurement errors significantly complicate matters. The pressure sensors may be used to study practical extrusion problems and to establish a better understanding of metal flow and the significance of die deformation. Thin strip extrusion experiments were performed to gain insight into the thermo-mechanics of flow instability (buckling). The feasibility of performing pressure measurement during the extrusion of thin strips was demonstrated, but sensors were not properly calibrated. The first round of the experiments was run with a die outlet 78. 5 mm wide and 1. 7 mm thick, and a container diameter of 100 mm. During extrusion of AA 6060 flow instability phenomena were not encountered. A second round of experiments was performed with non-instrumented dies and somewhat thinner profiles (1. 1 and 1. 4 mm). Flow instability in the form of buckling was provoked for high outlet temperatures, and many replicate experiments were performed. The shape of the buckled thin strip was also measured continuously with a laser triangulation technique during extrusion at high speed. Due to limitations related to the experimental set-up, neither the resolution nor the accuracy of the approach was entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated, and it is quite possible to improve the measurement technique. Capacitive pressure measurement techniques have been combined with methods for measuring the deformation of the mandrel and the straining of the bridges to study the behaviour of dies during tube extrusion. Capacitec capacitive probes were used to measure bridge strains. High temperature Kyowa strain gauges were also used for the same purpose. The die mandrel deflection was measured by conventional displacement transducers connected to the mandrel and the die cap by rods. Only measurements by the capacitive sensors proved sufficiently reliable during measurements. The study revealed that the state of stress in dies for hollow profiles may be very close to critical. The die face pressure at the top face of the mandrel exceeded 500 MPa. Two rounds of industrial experiments were performed with a U-profile that proved most difficult to extrude. In the first round of experiments, the flow stability was not satisfactory, and plugging of the outlet ruined experiments. The second round was more successful, and sensors were used to record the die face pressure on-line. The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of industrial experiments, but clearly indicated that further development of the sensors should be performed. It is important that sensors are made more durable, and that calibration techniques are further developed. Practical die designs that allow simple integration of sensors in the press should be developed. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
