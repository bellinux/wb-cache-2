50|$|In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine {{the high}} {{temperature}} and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a propelling nozzle and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power {{produced by the}} turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward {{from the front of}} the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the <b>hot</b> <b>nozzle</b> to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss propelling nozzle. The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new photo-fragment imaging spectrometer, which employs a movable {{repeller}} {{in a single}} field imaging geometry. This innovation offers two principal advantages. First, the optimal fields for velocity mapping can easily be achieved even using a large molecular beam diameter (5 mm); the velocity resolution (better than 1 %) is sufficient to easily resolve photo-electron recoil in (2 + 1) resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization of N 2 photoproducts from N 2 O or from molecular beam cooled N 2. Second, rapid changes between spatial imaging, velocity mapping, and slice imaging are straightforward. We demonstrate this technique's utility in a re-investigation of the photodissociation of N 2 O. Using a <b>hot</b> <b>nozzle,</b> we observe slice images that strongly depend on nozzle temperature. Our data indicate that in our <b>hot</b> <b>nozzle</b> expansion, only pure bending vibrations – (0, v 2, 0) – are populated, as vibrational excitation in pure stretching or bend-stretch combination modes are quenched via collisional near-resonant V-V energy transfer to the nearly degenerate bending states.

40|$|Fused Filament Fabrication is an {{additive}} manufacturing {{process by which}} a 3 D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a <b>hot</b> <b>nozzle</b> where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted {{side by side on}} the printer carriage. However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed – a disappointment for designers interested in 3 D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality – on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well.

40|$|Inspections {{have been}} carried out on the RPV head {{penetrations}} of the 7 Belgian PWR units since 1992, after cracking of these components was first discovered in France. This led to the detection of significant cracking in the base material Inconel 600 of several head penetrations of a same heat in the Tihange 1 unit in 1998. Crack growth analysis made it possible to justify the operation for one more 17 -month cycle, and in this period a new head was purchased and installed at the next outage in 1999. Inspections in other units have shown some indications but to a lesser extent and with relatively slow growth. The situation is monitored by regular inspections. The cracking events in VC Summer and Ringhals in the <b>hot</b> leg <b>nozzle</b> to piping Inconel welds gave rise to the concern that a similar situation might occur in the Belgian units, which also have Inconel 182 welds in the reactor pressure vessel and pressurizer nozzle to safe-ends welds. A detailed review of the fabrication procedures was performed, as well as stress analyses to evaluate the operating stress level and fracture mechanics analyses to evaluate the corrosion crack growth.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{are long}} hollow fibers made exclusively of carbon. They are generally synthesized from the dissociation of a carbon source and the co-injection of a metal catalyst. CNT interest {{the scientific community}} due to their impressive properties. They possess a high modulus of elasticity, high tensile strain, superconductor and semiconductor behaviours, high thermal conductivity and storage capabilities. These properties have been recently exploited to develop promising applications {{in the field of}} advanced materials, electronic components, and storage of gas and materials. However, the implementation process of these products is hindered due to the unavailability of large quantities of CNT and the current high cost of production. Presently, CNT are commercially produced via the arc discharge on graphite electrodes and the laser ablation of graphite. These methods yield limited production rates and represent low scale-up potential. In this work, this problem is solved by developing a new process in which CNT are produced via the dissociation of a liquid carbonaceous raw material in the water-cooled nozzle of a 100 kW DC non-transferred thermal plasma torch. The attractive aspect of this process is its scalability, since the technology of DC thermal plasma torch operating at the megawatt level is readily available. Here, tetrachloroethylene (TCE) is selected as the carbon raw material. It is preliminarily vaporized and injected into the plasma torch nozzle. The metal catalyst for the growth of CNT is provided from the erosion of the torch electrodes made of tungsten. The erosion of the electrodes generates tungsten vapours that are nucleated into catalyst nanoparticles of 10 - 20 nm in diameter in the plasma torch nozzle. Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) of 50 urn in length and 10 - 30 run in diameter are found in a graphitized coating condensed {{on the walls of the}} water-cooled torch nozzle. These MWNT are particularly grown on the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles at a temperature above the peritectic transformation of tungsten carbide (WC). This synthesis method also generates byproducts. Carbon nano-onions and nanoparticles are notably observed in the soot. CNT mass yield values are evaluated from thermogravimetry analysis and corroborated using electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. This led us to conduct a parametric study in order to determine the influence of the different operating parameters on the yields of carbon nanotubes. Low pressure, high TCE feed rate and long time of operation all enhance the yield of CNT. This parametric study and CFD modeling reveal that the formation of a supersonic jet, high vapour pressures of carbon and a control of the temperature profile within the water-cooled torch nozzle generate a rapid growth of CNT. Optimization work with the view to push the formation of CNT downstream of the torch nozzle and to synthesize thinner CNT is also exposed. In summary, the injection of the carbonaceous raw material in a <b>hot</b> torch <b>nozzle</b> prevents the condensation of a graphitized coating and enables continuous operation over several hours. Nickel and iron are injected into the plasma jet as metal catalyst. The resulting metal vapours are nucleated into small sized nanoparticles (≤ 10 nm). These successfully catalyze the synthesis of thinner CNT of ≤ 10 run in the soot collected downstream of the <b>hot</b> torch <b>nozzle,</b> some of which are SWNT of 1 nm- 2. 5 nm in diameter. The thermal plasma dissociation of toluene as liquid carbonaceous raw material generates hydrogen gas (H 2) in the plasma jet, which sensibly reduces the formation of amorphous carbon and yields cleaner CNT...|$|R
