The title refers to the river that flows through the town in Verne's story and to the love scene between Frantz and Suzel that takes place on its banks. The author has been a source for several other of the composer's works.

50|$|Additionally, {{the type}} of habitat which this mussel frequents appears related to its {{physical}} appearance. In the Illinois River in Oklahoma, specimens found in silty backwaters have been observed to be large, darkly stained, and with algal growth on their shells.

5000|$|Cited in Eric Rohmer's 1986 film, the <b>green</b> <b>ray</b> {{is used as}} {{a central}} image {{providing}} meaning and guidance for the film's troubled main character, Delphine. Verne's book is discussed at length in the film as a [...] "fairytale love story" [...] whose protagonists are consumed in their search for the rare meteorological phenomenon. Believed to give a heightened perception to those who view it, one of the characters further explains that [...] "when you see the <b>green</b> <b>ray</b> you can read your own feelings and others too." [...] Seizing this idea, Delphine uses her own search for the 'rayon vert' to help overcome her crippling fear of intimacy.|$|E

Perfectly parallel rays (shown in blue) would be captured, but sunlight, due to its angular aperture, is partially lost.|$|R
