5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Netherlands in 1940, {{the government of the}} Indies began preparing for a possible Japanese invasion. In Langkat, a Home Guard, or Stadswacht, division was established to defend Tanjung Pura, in Langkat. Amir and his cousin Tengku Harun were in charge; the nobility, trusted by the general populace, was selected to ensure easier recruitment of commoners. When the invasion became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of the soldiers sent to Medan to defend it. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Dutch-allied forces were quickly captured by the Japanese. He was held as a prisoner of war until 1943, when influence from the Sultan allowed him to be released. Throughout the remainder of the occupation, which lasted until 1945, Amir was employed as a radio commentator and censor in Medan. In his position as prince, he was tasked with helping to collect rice to feed the Japanese occupation army.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ashraf's rule in Damascus was stable, but <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> emirs of Syria {{sought to}} assert their {{independence}} from Cairo. Amid these tensions, al-Ashraf died in August 1237 after a four-month illness and was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail. Two months later, al-Kamil's Egyptian army arrived and besieged Damascus, but as-Salih Ismail had destroyed the suburbs {{of the city to}} deny al-Kamil's forces shelter. In 1232, al-Kamil installed his eldest son as-Salih Ayyub to govern Hisn Kayfa, but upon al-Kamil's death in 1238, as-Salih Ayyub disputed the proclamation of younger brother al-Adil II as sultan in Cairo. As-Salih Ayyub eventually occupied Damascus in December 1238, but his uncle Ismail retrieved the city in September 1239. Ismail's cousin an-Nasir Dawud had Ismail detained in Karak in a move to prevent the latter's arrest by al-Adil II. Ismail entered into an alliance with Dawud who released him the following year, allowing him to proclaim himself sultan in place of al-Adil II in May 1240.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 the German Reichstag {{developed}} a plan {{by which the}} river in Duala would be moved inland to allow for wholly European riverside settlements. Manga Bell became the leader of pan-Duala resistance to the policy. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> chiefs at first pressured the administration through letters, petitions, and legal arguments, but these were ignored or rebutted. Manga Bell turned to other European governments for aid, and he sent representatives to the leaders of other Cameroonian peoples to suggest {{the overthrow of the}} German regime. Sultan Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum people reported his actions to the authorities, and the Duala leader was arrested. After a summary trial, Manga Bell was hanged for high treason on 8 August 1914. His actions made him a martyr in Cameroonian eyes. Writers such as Mark W. DeLancey, Mark Dike DeLancey, and Helmuth Stoecker view his actions as an early example of Cameroonian nationalism.|$|E

Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees.

5|$|Pierce, so far, {{has been}} {{overlooked}} for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. However, in October 2014 he was selected {{for the first time}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America's (BBWAA) overview committee to be one of ten candidates on the Golden Era Committee ballot for possible induction in 2015. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie MiÃ±oso, all fell short of selection. The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Pierce received less than 4 votes of the required 12 votes from the committee at the MLB winter meeting on December 8, with no one elected to the Hall by the committee. Ron Santo received 15 votes at the committee's previous election, prior to his 2012 enshrinement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, {{it came as}} a jolt when, with a {{group of}} senators, Senator Stuart Symington {{publicly}} expressed his [...] "surprise, shock and anger" [...] at what <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> claimed was their [...] "recent discovery" [...] of [...] "CIA's secret war" [...] in Laos.

5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove KhÃ¡nh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Ká»³, Thiá»‡u, CÃ³ and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Tháº£o, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General LÃª NguyÃªn Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against KhÃ¡nh but said <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Tháº£o was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Tháº£o, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E
5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E
50|$|David Strorm is {{the narrator}} of the story. David {{is one of a}} small group of youngsters who can {{communicate}} with each other via telepathy.
