40|$|The {{epidemiological}} {{status of}} hydatidosis, cysticercosis, and gid in sheep {{and the production}} practices <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> farmers that increase the risk <b>of</b> exposure <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> to infecting agents of these diseases were investigated in Thessaly, central Greece during 2002 - 2006. A total <b>of</b> 700 hoggets (<b>sheep</b> up {{to the age of}} I year) and 1500 adult sheep were examined randomly at an abattoir survey and the prevalences of hydaticlosis and cysticercosis, were found 39. 32 % and 29. 41 %, respectively. Hoggets had significantly lower prevalences of hydatidosis and cysticercosis compared to adult sheep (p < 0. 001). The distribution of parasitic cysts showed an overdispersion pattern mostly in the hogget population. The proportion of fertile hydatid cysts was significantly higher in hoggets compared to adult sheep (p < 0. 001). A cohort <b>of</b> 74 <b>sheep</b> flocks was observed during the same period in a prospective survey to assess the incidence <b>of</b> <b>gid.</b> A total <b>of</b> 57 <b>sheep</b> belonging to 15 flocks (20. 27 % of investigated flocks) developed clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>gid</b> {{at an annual rate of}} 11. 40 +/- 4. 77 (95 % C. I.). In the infected flocks there were 3. 80 +/- 0. 92 (95 % C. I.) gid cases per flock. The mean age of onset of clinical signs for all sheep was 11. 86 +/- 1. 33 months (95 % C. I.) (range 5 - 22 months) while for hoggets was 8. 48 +/- 0. 73 (95 % C. I.) (range 5 - 12 months) and for adult sheep 17. 23 +/- 1. 42 (95 % C. I.) (range 13 - 22 months). A significant difference was observed in the prevalence of unilateral blindness between hoggets (31. 42 %) and adult sheep (4. 54 %) (p < 0. 05). The most common production practices identified in a questionnaire survey <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> farmers that may increase the risk <b>of</b> exposure <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> to hydatidosis, cysticercosis, and gid were the improper disposal of dead animals, the access of farm dogs to offal <b>of</b> slaughtered <b>sheep,</b> the carelessness <b>of</b> farmers to treat farm dogs with anthelmintics, and the grazing of flocks in fields where stray dogs have free access.

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the influence of}} the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) on the past, present and future distributions <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in Australia. Design The role of the dingo in the rise and fall <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> numbers is reviewed, revised data are provided on the present distribution and density <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and dingoes, and historical patterns <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> distribution are used to explore the future <b>of</b> rangeland <b>sheep</b> grazing. Results Dingoes are a critical causal factor in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> at the national, regional and local levels. Dingo predation contributed substantially to the historical contraction <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> industry to its present-day distribution, which is almost exclusively confined to areas within fenced dingo exclusion zones. Dingo populations and/or their influence are now present and increasing in all <b>sheep</b> production zones <b>of</b> Australia, inclusive of areas that were once dingo free'. Conclusions Rangeland production <b>of</b> wool and <b>sheep</b> meat is predicted to disappear within 30 - 40 years if the present rate of contraction of the industry continues unabated. Understanding the influence <b>of</b> dingoes on <b>sheep</b> production may help refine disease response strategies and help predict the future distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and their diseases...|$|R

40|$|In {{areas where}} {{water is a}} scarce commodity, a {{strategy}} to determine water requirement <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> to supply the amount of water, especially in droughts, are needed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to offering a model to determine water requirement <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in winter pastures. This study was conducted in four commercial ﬂocks <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in winter pastures of north of Golestan province (Gomishan and Aq-Qala) during the grazing season at December 2010 to April 2011. Among factors affecting on water requirement <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> the factors <b>of</b> ambient temperature, rainfall, wind speed, relative humidity, forage moisture and level <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> has been studied.

40|$|Accurate {{flatness}} {{measurement of}} silicon wafers is affected greatly by the gravity-induced deflection (<b>GID)</b> <b>of</b> the wafers, especially for large and thin wafers.

The accurate calculation <b>of</b> <b>GID</b> is affected by the initial stress of the wafer and the positioning errors of the supports. In this paper, a finite element model (FEM) including the effect of initial stress was developed to calculate <b>GID.</b> The influence <b>of</b> the initial stress of the wafer on GID calculation was investigated and verified by experiment. A systematic study of the effects of positioning errors of the support ball and the wafer on GID calculation was conducted. The results showed that the effect of the initial stress could not be neglected for ground wafers. The wafer positioning error and the circumferential error of the support were the most influential factors while the effect of the vertical positioning error was negligible in GID calculation...|$|R
