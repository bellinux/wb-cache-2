He {{averaged}} 17.6points and 8.9rebounds per game, and was also the only team member to play in all 82 games that season. Gasol led the team in scoring (19.0 points per game) in his second year with the Grizzlies, and {{for the second year in}} a row, played in all 82 games. Gasol missed the first game of his career, during his third year, with a foot injury on April 5, 2004, which snapped his string of 240consecutive games played. <b>He</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> 1,500threbound of his career on November 12, 2003, against the Orlando Magic and scored his 3,000thcareer point on October 31, 2003, against the Boston Celtics.

This was both the Grizzlies and Gasol's first trip to the NBA Playoffs. He scored 31points and blocked four shots on January 11, 2005, against the Indiana Pacers to earn 5,000points and 500blocks in his career, becoming the 10th fastest player to reach 5,000 points/500 blocks since 1973–74.

He beat riders twenty years younger than him to accomplish this feat. With that performance, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> leader's jersey, but lost it to Kristijan Durasek on Stage 6. He had to abandon on the last stage since he crashed after hitting a dog.|$|E
25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E

25|$|Raymond was {{considered}} the deadly older brother who was the eldest of all the brothers and had a criminal record stretching back to 1947. Raymond specialized in extortion and was a suspect of hundreds of crimes throughout Montreal but despite his crime and tactics he was rarely convicted. In November 1976, Raymond had been driving in his limousine when he was violating traffic laws by going through twelve red lights in a row, when he was pulled over by a police officer and was arrested, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> officers finger and twisted it until it broke. Raymond faced murder charges in 1974 but was acquitted. Raymond died at his own hand in 1989 when he committed suicide {{at the age of}} 57 and was found in a hotel room surrounded by pills with his wrists slit.|$|E
25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> {{barrel of a}} prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and {{he was unable to}} remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|E
25|$|Merckx {{returned}} to the Giro in 1972 and resumed his domination. <b>He</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> lead after a long solo attack during the race's seventh stage and never {{let go of the}} lead. Merckx led the 1973 Giro d'Italia from start to finish; a feat that had not been done since Alfredo Binda did in 1927. José Manuel Fuente gained the lead early on in 1974 and held it {{all the way up to}} the Giro's fourteenth stage. Fuente had forgotten to eat properly during the fourteenth stage and suffered because of it; he lost over ten minutes to Merckx. Merckx would go on to win his fifth and final Giro d'Italia by just 12 seconds, joining the likes of Alfredo Binda and Fausto Coppi as the only five-time winners of the Giro d'Italia. Merckx success continued on into the season as he won the Tour de France and the men's road race at the World Championships and became the first rider to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling– which consists of winning two Grand Tours and the men's road race at the World Championships in one calendar year.|$|E

Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 1994, Holland {{commanded}} a single-aircraft training {{mission to the}} Yakima Bombing Range, to provide an authorized photographer an opportunity to document the aircraft as it dropped training munitions. The minimum aircraft altitude permitted for that area was 500 feet (150m) AGL. During the mission, Holland's aircraft was filmed crossing one ridgeline about 30 feet (10m) above the ground. Fearing for their safety, the photography crew ceased filming and took cover as Holland's aircraft again passed low over the ground, this time estimated as clearing the ridgeline by only three feet (1m). The co-pilot on Holland's aircraft testified that <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> controls to prevent Holland from flying the aircraft into the ridge while the aircraft's other two aircrew members repeatedly screamed at Holland: [...] "Climb! Climb!" [...] Holland responded by laughing and calling one of the crew members [...] "a pussy".|$|E

2500|$|However, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making Grand Rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry's ear as if to whisper the countersign. But with bayonet secreted in hand, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet at his throat, the sentry gave up the password. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877 [...] and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of The Canadian Literary Journal. [...] Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as [...] "the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger." [...] His name was Vincent and he did not wander about the woods for days. [...] Snider's source for the provenance of the countersign should thus be considered to be unreliable.|$|E
