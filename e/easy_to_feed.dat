25|$|Corydoras aeneus is not {{particular}} about {{the composition of}} the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28 °C (68 to 82 °F), pH of 6.0–8.0, and hardness of 2–30 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it. A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed,</b> they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28 °C to a week at 20 °C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep {{to the bottom of the}} tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks.|$|E

50|$|An aglet {{is a small}} sheath, {{often made}} of plastic or metal, used on each end of a shoelace, a cord, or a drawstring. An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its {{firmness}} and narrow profile make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> hold and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> through eyelets, lugs, or other lacing guides.|$|R
2500|$|On a {{much smaller}} scale sheep grazing was locally popular; sheep were <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and needed less water. However, Americans did not eat mutton. As farmers moved in open range cattle {{ranching}} {{came to an end}} and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to [...] "fence wars" [...] which erupted over disputes about water rights.|$|R

50|$|The closet auger (named after water closet) feeds a {{relatively}} short auger through a hook-shaped length of metal tubing. The hook shape makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> the auger into the toilet. A plastic boot {{on the end of}} the auger protects the finish of the visible porcelain. Since most toilet clogs occur in the trap built into the bowl, the short cable is sufficient to break up or retrieve the greater majority of clogs.|$|R
50|$|Live-bearing {{aquarium}} fish, often simply called livebearers, are {{fish that}} retain the eggs {{inside the body}} and give birth to live, free-swimming young. Because the newborn fish are large compared to the fry of oviparous fish, they are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> than the fry of egg-laying species, such as characins and cichlids. This makes them much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> raise, and for this reason, aquarists often recommend them for beginners to fish breeding. In addition, being much larger makes them far less vulnerable to predation, and with sufficient cover, they can sometimes mature in a community tank.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Manks {{breed of}} cattle were low, deep-chested, hardy animals, of a dingy black, {{often with the}} ridge of the back, and ears, brown, or wholly of a dark brown colour, having seldom white or light coloured spots; short jointed, but not full in the hind quarter; the horn very thick at the root, and rather curving up-wards. They gave rich mills, but in small quantities; were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and fat, though not of early maturity. It would seem a breed well adapted to the climate, and the then state of culture.|$|E
50|$|The years 1596-98 {{were the}} worst for many years for the English population, as bad harvests coincided with {{outbreaks}} of disease, {{as well as a}} fall in wages which forced many people into starvation. Given the state of the poorest classes, those with property felt threatened by revolt, a fact not helped by the boom in publishing of sensationalist literature detailing the many 'crimes' of vagrants thanks to new printing technology. Over 20% of the rural population were considered 'poor' (i.e. impoverished) and so these fears were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed.</b> Furthermore, as it was up to the local gentry and JPs (Justices of the Peace) to enforce these laws {{there was a great deal}} of inconsistency in their application.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain boat-tail bullets with a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, {{and some}} lead between {{the core and}} the jacket. The cartridge itself consisted of a Berdan-primed, highly tapered (usually steel) case which seats the bullet and contains the powder charge. The taper makes it very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and extract the round, since there is little contact with the chamber walls until the round is fully seated. This taper is what causes the AK-47 to have distinctively curved magazines (helping to distinguish AK-47s from AK-74s, which feed from a much straighter magazine). While the bullet design {{has gone through a}} few redesigns, the cartridge itself remains largely unchanged. The ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of the M1943 pattern full metal jacket boat bullet is 0.138.|$|E
50|$|Curry - who {{was born}} in Afton and lived her entire life in the same house - came {{unexpectedly}} to her role as benefactor. Afton {{is at the top of}} a steep ascent, and during the inaugural Bikecentennial ride in 1976, she and her father encountered many tired cyclists in search of food and other provisions. In Curry’s words, “I decided it was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> them than <b>to</b> put them up!” Early on, Curry provided home-baked cookies to her visitors, which earned for her her nickname, “The Cookie Lady”.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the decades}} that {{followed}} World War II, {{there was much}} less unemployment in the UK and throughout the industrialized world, {{due in part to}} the Keynesian revolution. Even those without work or savings found it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> themselves, due <b>to</b> the establishment of the welfare state. As a result, hunger marches were no longer needed. There were incidences where thousands of people embarked on marches to draw attention to hunger in the developing world, as happened for example during the 1973 Ethiopian famine, but the term [...] "hunger march" [...] was not often used to describe these events.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, {{disaster}} struck the cattle industry. Overgrazing, harsh weather, and competition from sheep ranches {{led to a}} sharp price drop as ranchers gave up on cattle and sold their herds into a falling market. Sheep grazing took over as sheep were <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and needed less water. However, sheep also helped cause ecological changes that enabled foreign grasses to invade the Plains and also caused increased erosion. Open range cattle ranching {{came to an end}} and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to [...] "fence wars" [...] which erupted over disputes about water rights. Cattlemen and sheep ranchers sometimes engaged in violence against each other as did large and small cattle ranchers.|$|R

5000|$|Pork {{is popular}} {{throughout}} eastern Asia and the Pacific, where whole roast pig {{is a popular}} item in Pacific Island cuisine. It is consumed in a great many ways and highly esteemed in Chinese cuisine. Currently China is the world's largest pork consumer, with pork consumption expected to total 53 million tons in 2012, which {{accounts for more than}} half of global pork consumption. In China, pork is preferred over beef for economic and aesthetic reasons; the pig is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> and is not used for labour. The colours of the meat and the fat of pork are regarded as more appetizing, while the taste and smell are described as sweeter and cleaner. It is also considered easier to digest. In rural tradition, pork is shared to celebrate important occasions and to form bonding. In China, pork is so important that the nation maintains a [...] "strategic pork reserve". Red braised pork (hong shao rou), a delicacy from Hunan Province, is regarded as the [...] "brain food" [...] which inspired Mao Zedong. Other popular Chinese pork dishes are sweet and sour pork, bakkwa, and charsiu. In the Philippines, due to 300 years of Spanish colonization and influence, lechon, which is an entire roasted suckling pig, is the national delicacy.|$|E
5000|$|The Hotchkiss {{machine gun}} was gas {{actuated}} and air-cooled, {{in contrast to}} the Maxim gun which was recoil operated and water-cooled. The Hotchkiss machine gun barrel features five large annular rings which materially assisted natural cooling and retarded overheating. The gas cylinder under the barrel features a regulator piston which can be adjusted to the normal rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute. The Hotchkiss machine gun itself ( [...] excluding the tripod) has only 32 parts ( [...] US War Department Handbook of the Hotchkiss Machine Gun, Model of 1914 [...] ) including four coil springs and no screws or pins whatsoever. All parts of the gun are constructed in such a manner {{that it is impossible to}} assemble them improperly. The Hotchkiss fired from an open bolt, like almost all modern machine guns in order to avoid [...] "cook-offs", or cartridges being prematurely ignited by the heated chamber. Although the Hotchkiss machine gun was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> continuously with a three-man team, each individual strip held only 24 rounds of 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each empty feed strip was ejected automatically after its last round had been fired, leaving the bolt open in the rear position. Then introducing a new loaded strip into the gun triggered the release forward of the bolt and firing resumed. The Hotchkiss strips performed well with a three-man crew, but their capacity was too small for a single gunner firing from the inside of a tank. This led to the adoption of a 250-round articulated metal belt in 1917. It was widely used in all French tanks of the period and in some military airplanes [...]|$|E
25|$|Involuntary {{movements}} {{may make}} feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It may be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> finger <b>feed</b> than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). For liquids, {{it is often}} <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> drink from a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the other}} poison dart frogs, P. terribilis is {{harmless}} when raised {{away from its}} natural food source. They are a popular rainforest vivarium subject, and are somewhat <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> than some other dart frogs. Larger species of fruit flies, small crickets, waxworms, small mealworms, termites, and phoenix worms can be used if supplemented with calcium and other minerals. The temperature {{should be in the}} low to mid 20s (°C)/ 70s (°F). They are sensitive to high heat and suffer from a condition called [...] "wasting syndrome" [...] if overheated for too long. They require high humidity, as they come from one of the world's most humid rainforests. The Cali Zoo has a captive population of over 50 individuals. They are fed with crickets and share a habitat with several species of Colombian tree frogs.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how the {{structure}} of mealtimes within the family setting is related to children's fussy eating behaviours.

Such sorrow a woman feeds;--but a man starves it. Many will say that a woman feeds it, because she cannot but feed it; and that a man starves it, because his heart is of the starving kind. But, in truth, the difference comes not so much from the inner heart, as from the outer life. It is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> a sorrow upon needle-and-thread and novels, than it is upon lawyers' papers, or even the out-a-door occupations of a soldier home upon leave who has no work to do. Walter Marrable told himself again and again that he was very unhappy about his cousin, but he certainly did not suffer in that matter as Mary suffered. He had that other sorrow, arising from his father's cruel usage of him, to divide his thoughts, and probably thought quite as much of the manner in which he had been robbed, as he did of the loss of his love.|$|R

The Antarctic expeditions of both Shackleton and Scott took {{large quantities of}} these briquettes with them and used them to build pony stables. As the ponies were eaten, as planned, for food, the stables could be dismantled and used for fuel. Phurnacite briquettes later adopted a squared oval shape. This regular shape packed well as a good firebed, with plentiful airflow. They are also <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> mechanically <b>feed,</b> allowing the development of automatically controlled heating boilers that could run for days without human intervention.|$|R
50|$|When {{they lived}} with the Shoshone, the Comanche mainly used dog-drawn travois for transportation. Later, they {{acquired}} horses from other tribes, such as the Pueblo, and from the Spaniards. Since horses are faster, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> control and able to carry more, this helped with their hunting and warfare and made moving camp easier. Larger dwellings were made due {{to the ability to}} pull and carry more belongings. Being herbivores, horses were also <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> than dogs, since meat was a valuable resource. The horse was of the utmost value to the Comanche. A Comanche man's wealth was measured by the size of his horse herd. Horses were prime targets to steal during raids; often raids were conducted specifically to capture horses. Often horse herds numbering in the hundreds were stolen by Comanche during raids against other Indian nations, Spanish, Mexicans, and later from the ranches of Texans. Horses were used for warfare with the Comanche being considered to be among the finest light cavalry and mounted warriors in history.Much of the area inhabited by the Comanches was flat and dry, with the exception of major rivers like the Cimarron River, the Pecos River, the Brazos River, and the Red River. The water of these rivers was often too dirty to drink, so the Comanches usually lived along the smaller, clear streams that flowed into them. These streams supported trees that the Comanche used to build shelters.|$|R
