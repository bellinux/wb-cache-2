40|$|Subject: {{the article}} {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} using wild-growing reeds as an effective <b>heat-insulating</b> <b>material</b> in the construction of buildings for various purposes. The main advantages and disadvantages of reeds are analyzed, and it is shown that according to the thermo-technical characteristics cane can be used effectively as a <b>heat-insulating</b> <b>material.</b> Since the thermal conductivity (thermal resistance) of hygroscopic heat-insulating materials depends on their moisture content, a series of experiments was conducted to assess the moisture saturation of natural reeds under conditions of high air humidity. The obtained results were processed to obtain mathematical models for consumption of moisture by reeds during the material exploitation. Research objectives: creation of a mathematical model for calculating the moisture consumption parameters of reed stalks at high humidity parameters of the ambient air. Materials and methods: to achieve the goal, an experimental plant was developed for moistening the reed stalks, in which the samples were kept for several days. Three types of reed stalks were selected: stems with a length of 70 mm and an average diameter of 10 mm: 1 - without leaves; 2 - with leaves along {{the entire length of the}} cane; 3 - with leaves and nodal septa. Laboratory samples were brought to the state of their natural weight in the author-developed chamber with infrared heaters in the medium of calcined calcium chloride to absorb the moisture. After conducting the experiments, the moistened reed was weighed to determine the moisture saturation. Results: it has been experimentally confirmed that the curves of moisture saturation of reeds have a nonlinear character. The rate of water absorption in the first two days was 7. 9 % for the first type, 8. 7 % for the second type and 9. 8 % for the third type of reeds. After the first two days the rate of water absorption decreased and after eight days (168 hours) was 15. 6 % for samples of the first type, 15. 9 % for the second type, and 16. 3 % for the third type. Over the next ten days (240 hours), the change in the moisture content of the samples remained practically unchanged and amounted to 16. 1 % for the samples of the first kind, 16. 6 % for the second type, and 17. 3 % for the third type.

40|$|Combustion {{dynamics}} {{are critical}} {{to the development of}} high-efficiency, low-emission and fuel-flexible combustion systems used for propulsion and power generation. Predicting the onset of dynamics remains a challenge because of the complex interactions among several multi-scale phenomena, including turbulence, kinetics and acoustics, and their strong dependence on the operating conditions and fuel properties. In this thesis, a series of experiments were conducted in a laboratory-scale combustor, burning lean premixed propane/hydrogen/air mixtures over a range of equivalence ratio, fuel composition and inlet temperature. Dynamic pressure and flame chemiluminescence measurements are used to determine macro-scale characteristics such as the frequency, limit cycle amplitude and dynamic flame shape. High-speed, high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to quantify the micro-scale structure of the flow, while planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radical is used to investigate the flame microstructure. Results demonstrate that combustion dynamics in wake-stabilized flames can be characterized using a single non-dimensional parameter that collapses many response measures over a range of operating conditions and fuel composition, including the critical wake length at which dynamics is first observed, the critical phase at which transition among dynamic modes is encountered, and the limit cycle amplitude, emphasizing the role of the physics and chemistry of the flame processes in driving the overall system dynamics and encapsulating the governing mechanisms. The proposed parameter is based on the normalized strained flame consumption speed, which encapsulates the flow-combustion interactions at the flame scale. PIV data reveal significant changes in the recirculation zone structure depending on the equivalence ratio and the fuel composition, demonstrating the impact of chemical kinetics on the flow. These changes are shown to correlate strongly with the stability characteristics, i. e., blow-off and flashback limits as well as the onset of the thermoacoustic instabilities, highlighting a critical role of the recirculation zone in flame stabilization. An expression for the critical phase at which dynamic mode transition occurs is derived based on the linear acoustic energy balance. It is shown that the critical phase is also a function of the same non-dimensional parameter, suggesting that it represents the state within a dynamic mode as well. Results show that the normalized phase correlates with the upper- and lower-boundary of a dynamic mode, thus being a necessary and sufficient condition for dynamics. The results provide a metric for quantifying the instability margins of fuel-flexible combustors operating over a wide range of conditions. Analysis of PIV and OH-LIF data suggests that heat transfer near the flame-holder may {{play an important role in}} determining the stability characteristics. The impact of heat transfer on the onset of dynamics is experimentally investigated using different flame-holders.

40|$|<b>Heat-insulating</b> porous <b>materials</b> and {{structural}} ones having also a porous structure, which {{are produced by}} pressing and powder metallurgy methods, are widely used in engineering. One of the important thermophysical characteristics of such materials is a {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}}, which affects the choice of specific areas of their application. Along with the experimentally determined coefficient of thermal conductivity of porous materials, there are various approaches to estimate this coefficient. Most of these approaches have an empirical character and are based on various models of the structure of porous solid skelton, which enable us to approximately estimate contribution of this skeleton to the value of effective thermal conductivity of the entire porous body. A reliable estimate of the thermal conductivity of a porous solid skelton can be based on a modification of its structural model through conditional replacement of pores with their surrounding shells of the material by solid particles with an equivalent coefficient of the thermal conductivity. Such a replacement allows us to extend constructibility of computational dependencies, primarily, to obtain the guaranteed two-sided estimates of the effective thermal conductivity of a porous solid, including using the dual variational formulation of the problem of a steady-state heat conductivity in an inhomogeneous solid. The peculiarity of this formulation is that it includes two alternative functionals (minimized and maximized) that reach equal extremal values at the true temperature distribution in an inhomogeneous body. This property of alternative functionals makes it possible, according to their values, calculated at the approximate temperature distributions in this body, to obtain, respectively, the upper and lower bounds of its effective thermal conductivity. However, the use of the initial structural model of the porous solid skelton, provided that there is no thermal energy transfer through the pores, ensures the preservation of the physical sense only for the upper estimate of the effective thermal conductivity of this skeleton, and the lower estimate is either incorrect or corresponds to the zero value. The introduction of an equivalent thermal conductivity coefficient for a conditional solid particle replacing a pore surrounded by a layer of the solid skelton material allows using the variational approach to find correct two-sided estimates of the effective thermal conductivity and simultaneously to estimate the possible greatest error that can arise when using the computational dependencies based on different structural models and assumptions. </p...|$|R

New research suggests that due to climate change greater focus needs to be put on the production of building materials and not only the operational phase of the building. Since clay building technique cannot be classed as an established construction technology in Sweden some factors are lacking sufficient knowledge. There is no existing study that treats the mixture of clay and charcoal, the material produced in this work would therefore complement the existing materials straw clay, wood chips clay and haydite (Leca) clay. This work can, through practical experiments on construction solutions and operation, contribute to developing the inadequate state of knowledge in Sweden. The aim of this work was that by laboratory experiments with different proportions of granulated clay, charcoal, sand and water produce a filling material with heat insulating properties for constructions. The following questions have been answered in this work: - What parameters are important or even crucial for the cohesion of the material? - In which degree is the <b>material</b> <b>heat-insulating?</b> - How does the material affect building's internal environment and the external environment, during the life of the material? To answer the first question about the cohesion of the material clay granules, charcoal, sand and water were mixed in different ratios and then analyzed. The material were then applied into a timber frame construction. Pondered and brought a hypothetical discussion of the heat-insulation value of charcoal clay to answer the second. The third question was answered by gathering information from literature and scientific publications which then were applied on the results. Finally other factors were discussed such as how the mixing process affected the results in terms of cohesion, the isolation ability of charcoal clay and rationality linked to the production process.

40|$|Abstract The shear viscosity, density, thermal expansivity and {{specific}} heat capacity are important factors controlling the morphology, rheology, and texture of volcanic flows and deposits. These physical properties of silicate melts largely depend on chemical composition, water content, crystal content, bubble content and stress applied to the melt. Recently, it has been recognized that the applied stress {{plays an important role}} in the so called “glass transition” area of silicate melts. This kinetic boundary between brittle and ductile behavior affects the eruptive style. Thorough knowledge of the physical processes that occur at this brittle/ductile transition can affect the decision making of governments during volcanic crises and help to reduce and/or avoid loss of life and assets. Scientific knowledge from this research can be directly applied to the geomaterial industry. In addition, natural magmatic rocks are the major raw material in the production of microfibres and continuous fibres. Compared to normal glass fibres, rock fibres have a remarkable high temperature endurance, acid and alkali resistance and anti-heat impact. Rock products can be used as substitutes for metal and timber. They are likely to become more widely used in the near future. Further use for natural magmatic rocks include crushed stone, concrete aggregate, railroad ballast, production of high quality textile fibres, floor tiles, acid-resistant equipment for heavy industrial use, rockwool, basalt pipers, basalt reinforcement bars, basalt fibre roofing felt (ruberoid), basalt laminate (used as a protective coating), <b>heat-insulating</b> basalt fibre <b>materials</b> and glass wool (fibre glass). Since Bottinga and Weill (1970) first suggested that the density of melts in two or three component systems could be used to determine partial molar volumes of oxide components in silicate liquids, several models based upon this approach have been proposed in the Earth sciences literature. Considering that knowledge the densities of 8 Zn-bearing silicate melts have been determined, in equilibrium with air, in the temperature range of 1363 to 1850 K. The compositional joins investigated [sodium disilicate (NS 2) - ZnO; anorthite-diopside 1 atm eutectic (AnDi) -ZnO; and diopside-petedunnite] were chosen based on the pre-existing experimental density data set, on their petrological relevance, and in order to provide a test for significant compositionally induced variations in the structural role of ZnO. The ZnO concentrations investigated range up to 25 mol% for sodium disilicate, 20 mol% for the anorthite-diopside 1 atm eutectic, and 25 mol% for petedunnite. Molar volumes and expansivities have been derived for all melts. The molar volumes of the liquids decrease with increasing ZnO content. The partial molar volume of ZnO derived from the volumetric measurements for each binary system is the same within error. A multicomponent fit to the volumetric data for all compositions yields a value of 13. 59 (0. 55) cm 3 /mol at 1500 K. I find, no volumetric evidence for compositionally induced coordination number variations for ZnO in alkali-bearing vs. alkali-free silicate melts nor for Al-free vs. Al-bearing silicate melts. The partial molar volume of ZnO determined here may be incorporated into existing multicomponent models for the prediction of silicate melt volume. High temperature density determinations on ZnO-bearing silicate melts indicate that a single value for the partial molar volume of ZnO is sufficient to describe the volumetric properties of this component in silicate melts. The presence of alkalies and Al does not appear to influence the partial molar volume of ZnO within the temperature range investigated here. There is no volumetric evidence across this temperature range presented for composition to influence the coordination polyhedron of ZnO in silicate melts. The next physical property to be studied was thermal expansivity. Ten compositions from within the anorthite-wollastonite-gehlenite (An-Wo-Geh) compatibility triangle were investigated. Due to the lack of information about the thermal expansivities at supercooled liquid temperatures this study focused on the measurement of thermal expansivity using a combination of calorimetric and dilatometric methods. The volumes at room temperature were derived from densities measured using the Archimedean buoyancy method. For each sample density was measured at 298 K using glass that had a cooling-heating history of 10 - 10 K min- 1. The thermal expansion coefficient of the glass from 298 K to the glass transition interval was measured by a dilatometer and the heat capacity was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter from 298 to 1135 K. The thermal expansion coefficient and the heat flow were determined at a heating rate of 10 K min- 1 on glasses that were previously cooled at 10 K min- 1. Supercooled liquid density, molar volume and molar thermal expansivities were indirectly determined by combining differential scanning calorimetric and dilatometric measurements assuming that the kinetics of enthalpy and shear relaxation are equivalent. The data obtained on the supercooled liquids were compared to high-temperature predictions from the models of Lange and Carmichael (1987), Courtial and Dingwell (1995) and Lange (1997). The best linear fit combines the supercooled liquid data presented in this study and the high temperature data calculated using the Courtial and Dingwell (1995) model. This dilatometric/calorimetric method of determining supercooled liquid molar thermal expansivity greatly increases the temperature range accessible for thermal expansion. It represents a substantial increase in precision and understanding of the thermodynamics of calcium aluminosilicate melts. This enhanced precision demonstrates clearly the temperature independence of the melt expansions in the An-Wo-Geh system. This contrasts strongly with observations for neighboring system such as Anorthite-Diopside and raises the question of the compositional/structural origins of the temperature dependence of thermal expansivity in multicomponent silicate melts. In addition, the partial molar volumes and the thermal expansivities of 10 samples from within the An-Wo-Geh compatibility triangle have been determined. They have been incorporated into existing multicomponent models in order to predict silicate melt volume. The resulting supercooled liquid volumes near glass transition temperatures (1135 - 1200 K) and at superliquidus temperature were combined to yield temperature independent thermal expansivities over the entire temperature range. In light of results presented in this study, together with the published data, it seems that binary and ternary systems have temperature independent thermal expansivities from the supercooled liquid to the superliquidus temperature at 1 atmosphere. By combining the high temperature densitometry data (i. e., above liquidus) from the literature with volume and expansivity data obtained at Tsc, a wide temperature range is covered. There is no volumetric evidence across this temperature range for temperature independent thermal expansivities in the An-Wo-Geh compatibility triangle. Furthemore, the thermal expansivities of three multicomponent glasses and liquids have been obtained over a large temperature interval (298 - 1803 K) which involved combining the results of low and high temperature measurements. The sample compositions investigated were derived from three natural lavas; Vesuvius 1631 eruption, Etna 1992 eruption and an Oligocene-Miocene lava flow from Slapany in the Bohemian massif. The original rocks are tephri-phonolite, trachybasalt and basanite, respectively. This is the first time this calorimetric/dilatometric method has ever been applied to natural magmatic melts. The low temperature volumes were derived from measurements of the glass density of each sample after cooling at 5 K. min- 1 at 298 K, followed by measurements of the glass thermal expansion coefficient from 298 K to the samples´ respective glass transition interval. Supercooled liquid volumes and molar thermal expansivities were determined by combining scanning calorimetric and dilatometric measurements, assuming that the kinetics of enthalpy and shear relaxation are equivalent (Webb, 1992). High temperature densities were measured using Pt double bob Archimedean densitometry. In addition, the oxidation state of iron was analyzed using a wet chemistry method. Small amounts of samples were taken from the liquids using a “dip” technique at regular temperature steps during high temperature densitometry. The measured high temperature densities have been compared with predicted densities across the same temperature interval calculated using the multicomponent density models of Lange and Carmichael (1987) and Lange (1997). The resulting data for liquid volumes near glass transition temperatures (993 - 1010 K) and at super-liquidus temperatures (1512 - 1803 K) are combined to yield temperature dependant thermal expansivities over the entire supercooled and stable liquid range. These results confirm the observation of Knoche et al. (1992 a); Knoche et al. (1992 b); Toplis and Richet (2000); Liu and Lange (2001); Gottsmann and Dingwell (2002) of the temperature dependence of thermal expansivity. The molar volumes indicate, in general, a significant negative temperature dependence of the expansivity. The thermal molar expansivity of the glasses increase from SiO 2 -poor (basalt-basanite composition) to relatively SiO 2 -rich melts (tephri-phonolite composition). The thermal molar expansivity at supercooled liquid temperatures increases in the same manner as the glasses. In contrast, the thermal molar expansivity of the superliquidus liquid decrease from SiO 2 -poor to relatively SiO 2 -rich melts. Non-linear dependency of molar volume has been observed for all studied samples above the glass transition area. Molar|$|R
