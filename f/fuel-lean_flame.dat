Fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame</b> with different air factors were analyzed separately. Emission of fuel-rich flame is CO whereas emission of fuel-lean is NOx, and fuel rich-lean ratio {{is the most important}} factor for NOx and CO emission. If fuel-rich flame α 1 is changed with constant <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame</b> α 2, NOx emission decreases and CO emission increases evidently. If α 2 is changed with constant α 1, NOx decreases slightly and CO increases initially and then decreases.

40|$|Three-dimensional direct {{numerical}} simulations {{with detailed}} chemistry {{were performed to}} investigate the effect of equivalence ratio on spatial variations of the heat release rate and flame markers of hydrogen/carbon monoxide syngas expanding spherical premixed flames under turbulent conditions at elevated pressures. The flame structures and the heat release rate were analysed and compared between fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich centrally ignited spherical flames. The equivalence ratio changes the balance among thermo-diffusive effects, Darrieus-Landau instability and turbulence, leading to different flame dynamics and the heat release rate distribution, despite exhibiting similar cellular and wrinkling flames. The Darrieus-Landau instability is relatively insensitive to the equivalence ratio while the thermo-diffusive process is strongly affected by the equivalence ratio. As the thermo-diffusive effect increases as the equivalence ratio decreases, the <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame</b> is more unstable than the fuel-rich flame with the stoichiometric flame in between, under the joint effects of the thermo-diffusive instability and the Darrieus-Landau instability. The local heat release rate and curvature display a positive correlation for the lean flame, no correlation for the stoichiometric flame, and negative correlation for the rich flame. Furthermore, for the <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame,</b> the low and high heat release rate values {{are found in the}} negative and positive curvature zones, respectively, while for the fuel-rich flame, the opposite trends are found. It is found that heat release rate markers based on species concentrations vary strongly with changing equivalence ratio.

40|$|Coherent anti-Stokes Raman {{spectroscopy}} (CARS) is {{an established}} technique for gas-phase thermometry in combustion. In this work, rotational CARS in the dual-broadband {{approach has been}} investigated for flame thermometry in the product gas of ethylene/air flames {{in a wide range}} of equivalence ratios (0. 5 < phi < 2. 5). The nitrogen lines dominated the rotational CARS spectra in the whole equivalence range, but for <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flames</b> also oxygen lines gave significant spectral contributions. Therefore, the temperature evaluation was based on spectral fitting of both nitrogen and oxygen. Product gas species such as carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen contribute to the non-resonant susceptibility of the gas and influence the nitrogen and oxygen linewidths through collisions. In this work, the main focus was on the influence of these collisions on the nitrogen and oxygen Raman linewidths and consequently the evaluated temperature in the product gas of flames. In the range of studied equivalence ratios with various amounts of different product gas species, the evaluated temperature was raised up to 45 K when including broadening from CO 2, H 2 O, and CO on the measured nitrogen and oxygen lines. It was also concluded that H 2 O was the main contributor in all non-sooting flames. The influence of the non-resonant susceptibility in the spectral evaluation is discussed, and its coupling to the inclusion of the line broadening from product gas species as well.

While many studies have used the Mini-CAST to generate soot with known size, concentration, and organic carbon fraction under a single or few conditions, {{there has been no}} systematic study of the burner operation over a wide range of operating conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of the microphysical, chemical, morphological, and hygroscopic properties of Mini- CAST soot over the full range of oxidation air and mixing N 2 flow rates. Very fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame</b> conditions are found to produce organic-dominated soot with mode diameters of 10 – 60 nm, and the highest particle number concentrations are produced under fuel-rich conditions. The lowest organic fraction and largest diameter soot (70 – 130 nm) occur under slightly fuel-lean conditions. Moving from fuel-rich to fuel-lean conditions also increases the O:C ratio of the soot coatings from ~ 0. 05 to ~ 0. 25, which causes {{a small fraction of the}} particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei near the Kelvin limit (κ ~ 0 – 10 − 3). Comparison of these property ranges to those reported in the literature for aircraft and diesel engine soots indicates that the Mini-CAST soot is similar to real-world primary soot particles, which lends itself to a variety of process-based soot studies.

The mechanism focuses on the C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons reactions but it also includes heavier species up to C 6 hydrocarbons such as benzene and phenyl. New rate constants for the reactions of the key system C 2 H 3 +O 2 were calculated theoretically and rate constants for the C 3 H 3 recombination reaction were inferred from the recent literature. ^ This reaction set was then used in simulations of shock-tubes, flow reactors and especially flame experiments in various conditions. The predictions obtained throughout the study are generally in good agreement with the experimental data and establishes the overall high-quality of the reaction set. However, in the case of a fuel-lean (2 ̆ 6 phis; = 0. 70) ethylene flame, the predicted profiles of key radicals are not within the experimental uncertainty. The modeling of important reactions involving radicals such as H+O 2 in this environment may still be inaccurate. ^ A novel approach to flat-flame modeling is also introduced. External heat losses by radiation are included in the energy conservation equation for the first time. This improvement of the model allows the temperature profile to be computed in the case of real, non-adiabatic flames. The analysis of the predictions shows that temperature is greatly affected by the presence of soot in fuel-rich flames. In fuel-lean flames, insufficient heat is generated by the mechanism at low temperature.

H 577 P ME 2015 Miaoxix, 242 pages :color illustrationsAs {{a widely}} applied flame type, {{gas-fired}} diffusion flame {{has the advantage}} of wide stable operation range. However, the high pollutant emission rate is a noteworthy shortcoming of diffusion flame, and makes diffusion flame not applicable for many industries requiring low air pollutant emissions. Gas-fired premixed flame, however, has very strict stable operation range hence limited application. In the present investigation, an inverse diffusion flame (IDF) burner is used. The burner is featuring with a relatively large air jet {{in the center of the}} burner; and the fuel mixture, which is not premixed with air, is supplied to surround the central air jet. When velocity of central air jet is high enough, there will be large pressure difference between the air jet and fuel jets, and the pressure difference will entrain fuel as well as surrounding ambient air into the central air jet to form the flame base. The interaction between air and fuel in the entrainment zone can improve mixing process of air and fuel, and gives IDF the nature of diffusion flame as well as enhanced mixing feature of premixed flame. Therefore, IDF may be regarded as a partially premixed flame, and is expected to have the advantages of both diffusion flame and premixed flame: wide stable operation range and low pollutant emissions. As a compromise of diffusion flame and premixed flame, IDF can be applied to both small and large industrial burners burning gaseous fuels, which are usually hydrocarbon fuels. Although being widely used in combustion, hydrocarbon fuels have the shortcomings of too high fuel-lean flammability limit and inevitable high CO, CO₂ and HC emissions. Liquefied petroleum gas, which is one of the most widely used gaseous fuels in Hong Kong,also possesses the drawbacks of hydrocarbon fuels as mentioned above. In addition to optimization of the structure of IDF burner, improving the fuels used may be a possible method to further enhance the combustion performance and to further widen applications of IDF. Hydrogen fuel (H₂), with high flame temperature, none carbon content and high burning velocity is regarded as a very possible gaseous fuel to improve the properties of hydrocarbon fuels. Although hydrogen addition seems to be a promising solution to enhancing flame temperature and hence thermal performance and flame stability, and to reducing pollutant emissions of hydrocarbon fuels in both premixed flame (Zhang et al., 2008) and normal diffusion flame (Karbasi, 1998), no relevant research work has yet been done on effects of hydrogen addition in partially premixed flame, especially in inverse diffusion flame. The very particular air/fuel mixing mechanism of inverse diffusion flame may result in special phenomenon after adding hydrogen into the gaseous fuel. In fact, there are some contradictory results already reported by different researchers, who have applied various experimental methods and used different gaseous fuels together with hydrogen (Leung and Wierzba, 2008; Miao et al., 2009). Therefore, a comprehensive study is necessary to fully determine the actual influence of hydrogen addition on LPG fuel in inverse diffusion flame. In this study, experimental investigation has been conducted to fully assess the effects of hydrogen addition on the combustion, thermal and emission characteristics of LPG-H₂ IDF regarding laminar burning velocity, flame stability limits, flame temperature, OH-PLIF distribution and pollutant emission rate. The experimental results show that LPG is dominative in determining laminar burning velocity of LPG-H₂ mixture, and small amount of LPG can successfully impede the burning of H₂. In addition, hydrogen addition can significantly expand the <b>fuel-lean</b> <b>flame</b> stability limits in terms of air jet Reynolds number and overall equivalence ratio of the air/fuel jets, and can make LPG IDF more tenacious. Also, LPG-H₂ IDF has wider flame reaction zone marked by applying planar laser-induced fluorescence of hydroxyl radical (OH-PLIF) than LPG IDF does under similar operation conditions, indicating more intensive combustion due to H₂ addition. It is also found that there is a remarkable difference between OH-PLIF results of 100 %H₂ IDF and 10 %LPG- 90 %H₂ IDF. The reflux of flame, which forms concentric double flame structure in H₂ IDF has not been seen in 10 %LPG- 90 %H₂ IDF. Another positive effect of H₂ is that H₂ addition actually reduces the carbon-led pollutant emissions of the flame. Experiment result shows that with the use of H₂ addition, the emission rates of HC and CO decrease, while emission rate of CO₂ rises, suggesting that H₂ addition can also facilitate the transformation of emissions from HC and CO to CO₂ and thus perfects the combustion characteristics. In the present study,there are some results rather different from expectation. Addition of up to 60 % H₂ does not show notable effect on flame structure of LPG IDF, and high percentage of H₂ mainly changes the color of outer layer of the flame. The effect of H₂ on flame height of LPG IDF highly depends on percentage of hydrogen. For low H₂%, flame height lengthens with H₂ addition; while for high H₂%, H₂ addition can shorten the flame. The influence of H₂ addition on flame temperature of LPG IDF is almost not notable. Both LPG IDF and 50 %LPG- 50 %H₂ IDF have very similar values of flame temperature, as well as similar temperature distribution profiles. The effect of H₂ on laminar burning velocity of LPG is also not significant when H₂ addition is less than 60 %. Conclusively, LPG-H₂ IDF has similar flame structure, flame length, and temperature distribution with those of LPG IDF; however, LPG-H₂ IDF has wider stability range, more intensive and complete combustion, as well as lower pollutant emission rates.

Three <b>fuel-lean,</b> swirl-stabilized <b>flames</b> were investigated, each of which underwent self-excited thermoacoustic pulsations. The most energetic flow structure at each condition was a helical vortex core that circumscribed the combustor at a frequency that was independent of the acoustics. Resolving the measurement sequence with respect to both the phase in the thermoacoustic cycle and the azimuthal position of the helix allowed quantification of the oscillatory flow and flame dynamics. Periodic vortex/flame interactions caused by deformation of the helices generated local heat-release oscillations having spatially complex phase distributions relative to the acoustics. The local thermoacoustic coupling, determined by statistically solving the Rayleigh integral, showed intertwined regions {{of positive and negative}} coupling due to these vortices.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on developing {{a better understanding}} of triple flames. We relax the assumption of zero heat release, address the issue of stabilization, and, in order to investigate the role that heat release plays in flame propagation in partially premixed combustion, we return to a simple flow field and investigate the behavior of flames in a laminar environment. We solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. At the boundaries, we use an inflow boundary condition on the left and nearly-perfect reflective boundary conditions, required to avoid pressure drift, at the outflow and sides. After the flow and flame are initialized, the mixture fraction is varied at the inlet from its uniform stoichiometric value to a tanh profile varying from zero to one. As the mixture fraction gradient reaches the flame surface only the centerline is exposed to the stoichionetric mixture fraction and locally maintains the planar flame speed and reaction rate. Above this point the mixture is fuel rich, and below fuel lean. As a result, these regions of non-unity equivalence ratio burn less, the reaction rate drops, and the local flame speed is reduced. The excess fuel and oxidizer then combine behind the premixed flame along the stoichiometric surface and burn in a trailing diffusion flame. Thus the 'triple' flame refers to the fuel-rich premixed <b>flame,</b> the <b>fuel-lean</b> premixed <b>flame,</b> and the trailing diffusion flame.

Consistent with previous work with DNS without mean flow and shear, the resulting flame from localized forced ignition at the jet exhibits predominantly premixed edge flame structure where premixed flames are formed on both the fuel-rich and fuel-lean sides and the intersection between these two branches propagate on the stoichiometric mixture fraction isosurface. The edge flame propagation behavior has been studied in terms of the statistics of the edge flame displacement speed S d, which refers to the speed at which the fuel mass fraction Y F isosurface moves normal to itself, relative to an initially coincident material surface at the intersection between the fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> premixed <b>flames</b> on the stoichiometric mixture fraction isosurface.

The flame propagation characteristics have been analyzed in terms of the reaction, normal diffusion and tangential diffusion components of the density-weighted displacement speed for different values of reaction progress variables across the flame brush. It has been found that the reaction, normal diffusion and tangential diffusion components of density-weighted displacement speed, remain the major contributors to the density-weighted displacement speed at all stages of flame evolution as the magnitude of the component which originates due to mixture inhomogeneity remains negligible in comparison to the magnitudes of other components in accordance with previous experimental studies. It has been demonstrated that curvature and tangential strain rate dependences of the reaction progress variable gradient play key roles in determining strain rate dependences of the reaction and normal diffusion components of the density-weighted displacement speed. It has been shown that the interrelation between tangential strain rate and curvature affects the strain rate dependence of tangential diffusion component of the density-weighted displacement speed. The density-weighted displacement speed and curvature are found to be predominantly negatively correlated throughout the flame brush at all stages of the flame evolution. The relative strengths of the tangential strain rate dependence of the reaction, normal diffusion and tangential diffusion components of the density-weighted displacement speed ultimately determine the nature of correlation between the density-weighted displacement speed and the tangential strain rate. The strain rate and curvature dependences of the density-weighted displacement speed in stratified mixtures are found to be qualitatively similar to the statistics previously obtained for turbulent premixed flames...|$|R
