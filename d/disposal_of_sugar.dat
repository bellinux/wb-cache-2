This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background The <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> mill effluent {{has become a}} major problem in India due to generation of huge volume of effluent. The value of wastewater for crop pro-duction has been recognized in many countries, including India. The effluents not only contain nutrients that stimulate growth of many crops, but also may have various toxic chemicals, metals, metallic oxides along with nitrogenous and phosphate compounds, which may affect various agro-nomical characteristics of crop plants. The present investi-gation was conducted to asses the agro-potentiality of agro-based sugar mill effluent as ferti-irrigant, and an alternative of irrigation water. Six plots were selected for six treatment...|$|E

In adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic beta-cells, lipids are mobilized from acylglycerides by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Here, the consequences of a targeted disruption of the HSL gene for glucose homeostasis were examined. HSL null mice were slightly hyperglycemic in the fasted, but not fed state, which was accompanied by moderate hyperinsulinemia. During glucose challenges, however, <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sugar</b> was not affected in HSL null mice, presumably because of release of increased amounts of insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity was further indicated by retarded glucose disposal during an insulin tolerance test. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that hepatic glucose production was insufficiently blocked by insulin in HSL null mice. In vitro, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into soleus muscle, and lipogenesis in adipocytes were moderately reduced, suggesting additional sites of insulin resistance. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic islets revealed a doubling of beta-cell mass in HSL null mice, which is consistent with an adaptation to insulin resistance. Insulin secretion in vitro, examined by perifusion of isolated islets, was not impacted by HSL deficiency. Thus, HSL deficiency results in a moderate impairment of insulin sensitivity in multiple target tissues of the hormone but is compensated by hyperinsulinemia...|$|R

As the other countries, {{we are also}} facing the waste <b>disposal</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> and distillery waste. At present, few of the wastes generated in the plant are {{being used by the}} factory it self as material or energy source, but still some wastes are released to the environment with out any proper treatment. The major objective of this research is to find out the potential of in vessel high rate composting <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> press mud along with maximum contribution of spent wash and other wastes generated in an integrated sugar plant cum distillery. The major draw back of high rate composting is high energy requirement and it is expected to satisfy through biomethanation of spent wash. A series of experiments were carried out in a 210 L compost unit to determine possible feedstock composition for in vessel composting. By in-vessel high-rate method, the compo sting period could be dramatically brought down to about 12 Press mud: spent wash ratio of 18 : 1 (spent wash added initially) appeared to be best composition for in vessel high rate composting. However, 9 : 1 ratio could be achieved if spent wash is applied after reaching the highest temperature in the However 183 T of annual nitrogen supply could be achieved through production compost. Also a senes of experiments were carried out to observe biornefhanation potential of distillery spent wash. All the experiments were carried out in specially designed laboratory scale apparatus. It was calculated that energy. needed to achieve above rates of composting could be easily achieved by simple, single-stage batch type bio-rnethanation without mixing. 65 - 70 % COD reduction and 9. 4 m 3 /m 3 feed to specific gas production could be obtained, by this method with optimum condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Children’s stool {{disposal}} {{is often}} overlooked in sanitation programs of any country. Unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route. Therefore, the study {{aims to examine}} the magnitude <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools in India, the factors associated with it and finally its association with childhood diarrhea. Methods Data from {{the third round of}} the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) conducted in 2005 – 06 is used to carry out the analysis. The binary logistic regression model is used to examine the factors associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool. Binary logistic regression is also used to examine the association between unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool and childhood diarrhea. Result Overall, stools of 79 % of children in India were disposed of unsafely. The urban-rural gap in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool was wide. Mother’s illiteracy and lack of exposure to media, the age of the child, religion and caste/tribe of the household head, wealth index, access to toilet facility and urban-rural residence were statistically associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> stool. The odds of diarrhea in children whose stools were disposed of unsafely was estimated to be 11 % higher (95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 21) than that of children whose stools were disposed of safely. An increase in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool in the community also increased the risk of diarrhea in children. Conclusion We found significant statistical association between children’s stool disposal and diarrhea. Therefore, gains in reduction of childhood diarrhea can be achieved in India through the complete elimination <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools. The sanitation programmes currently being run in India must also focus on safe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool...|$|R
