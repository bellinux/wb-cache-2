40|$|An {{embedded}} {{implementation of}} a hybrid neural-network based telephone speech recognition system is described. The system (1) <b>digitizes</b> <b>speech</b> and computes a PLP spectral representation; (2) uses a Neural Network to assign 534 contextual phoneme probabilities; and (3) uses these phoneme probabilities for a general purpose word-spotting task. 1.

The algorithm is implemented on a Linkon FC 3000 PC telephony board, which can have up to 12 DSP 32 C processors per board (one for each connected telephone line).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper stochastically models a single-node telecommunications system both {{with and without}} the use of intelligent multiplexing. Intelligent multiplexers take advantage of the idle periods or silences that occur during the course of speech transmissions to merge (or multiplex) packetized talkspurts from more than one source onto a single channel. This allows for a more efficient use of available bandwidth, thereby reducing the amount of bandwidth required to carry a particular traffic load. <b>Digitizing</b> <b>speech</b> into packets of equal size also allows for compression, further reducing bandwidth needs. By comparing the models for systems both with and without multiplexing, we are able to determine the reduction in bandwidth which may be expected for a particular grade of service (measured by blocking probabilities). A bivariate continuous time Markov chain model for a multiplexer is presented. An approximation is introduced to calculate limiting blocking probabilities much more quickly and for larger systems than is possible by solving a set of linear equations for the bivariate model. The accuracy of the approximation is explored through comparison with the bivariate model; the approximation provides a somewhat conservative estimate of blocking, but is close enough {{to be used as a}} tool for the range of relevant values. The approximation is then used to compare blocking probabilities for three different levels of speech activity.

40|$|Rationale for the {{colloquium}} The use {{of corpus}} data has drastically changed {{our approach to}} language. However, few oral corpora are at the linguist’s disposal. Moreover, the methods and techniques used to exploit written data are not always very suitable to spoken data. And even if now new technologies are available to record spontaneous <b>speech,</b> <b>digitize</b> the sound and transcribe the files, {{we still have to}} note that a large corpus of spoken French which would be available to the scientific community as a whole does not exist. Our project aims at filling this gap and our objective is to create, analyse and distribute the ESLO corpus (see below). The Enquête Sociolinguistique à Orléans (Socio-Linguistic Survey in Orléans: ESLO 1) was undertaken from 1968 to 1971 by British scholars. Their aim was to record spontaneous interactions to teach French as a foreign language at secondary school level. The data gathered constitute an important oral corpus of about 300 hours of speech (4, 500, 000 words), with interviews and other recordings.
