5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E

The {{dangerous}} Graham Napier followed almost straight away, and the steady rate of wickets to fall continued {{to the end of}} the innings. Pettini was the top scorer, hitting a 47-ball 54 but with a lack of support, the Eagles were always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> short. Three run outs didn't help either as the Eagles' chance at the Stanford Super Series ended.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, {{there were}} {{concerns}} over the fleet's capable lifespan. Several projects beyond the B-52, the Convair B-58 Hustler and North American XB-70 Valkyrie, had either been aborted or proved disappointing in light of changing requirements, which left the older B-52 as the main bomber {{as opposed to the}} planned successive aircraft models. On 19 February 1965, General Curtis E. LeMay testified to Congress that the lack of a follow-up bomber project to the B-52 raised the danger that, [...] "The B-52 is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> apart on us before we can get a replacement for it." [...] Other aircraft, such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, later complemented the B-52 in roles the aircraft was not as capable in, such as missions involving high-speed, low-level penetration dashes.|$|E

Aggressive leadership is lacking." [...] MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that [...] "in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea."

500|$|The {{surprise}} {{success of}} Guitar Hero readily {{led to the}} development of a sequel for the game. According to developer John Tam, the team felt they [...] "hit the sweet spot" [...] of genres and decades within the set list and wanted to maintain that for the sequel. [...] The costs of obtaining licensing rights for music from [...] "big bands" [...] such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Metallica, in addition to the lack of understanding of how the music would be used prevented these groups from being used in Guitar Hero. [...] However, Tam notes that with the success of Guitar Hero, [...] "They understand that we're not going to embarrass their music, we're going to actually pay homage to their music and get it to the point where people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love with their music and understand their music in a totally different way than they've ever experienced it before."

500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's {{been here for a}} while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
500|$|Hyde {{used the}} digital audio {{workstation}} Pro Tools during the engineering, [...] production, and audio mixing {{stages of the}} album. Slayer members {{wanted to keep the}} use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: [...] "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> apart but never did." [...] Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks [...] "Scarstruck" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Pain," [...] the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought [...] "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," [...] so he wrote another, going on to comment [...] "you don't have to be good to make up a seven-string riff." [...] The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide [...] "a fresh pair of ears". [...] Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering. [...] He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin, and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager Steve O'Rourke. [...] All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "clean" [...] mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more [...] "echoey" [...] mix. [...] Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating [...] "There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. [...] In fact, there were never any hints that they were later <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> out. [...] It was a very creative atmosphere. [...] A lot of fun." [...] Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. [...] Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on [...] "Us and Them". [...] He was also present for the recording of [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry).

500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love with Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{entitled}} [...] "For Evermore", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{was written}} by composer Menken and lyricist Rice. The last of the three original songs written for the remake, [...] "Evermore" [...] was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own. Written in Spring 2015 in London, England, Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle. Actor Dan Stevens, who portrays the Beast and performs [...] "Evermore", had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film. Before [...] "Evermore" [...] was written, Condon informed Stevens {{that he would be}} singing a new song in his role as Beast. Having not sung professionally since childhood, Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice, the process of which he found challenging. To prepare for the recording, Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann-Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken. Stevens first recorded a [...] "guide track" [...] for [...] "Evermore" [...] before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes. To make the actor sound more [...] "beast-like", sound engineers digitally modified Stevens' voice, which Menken produced himself. Auto-Tune was used to make Stevens' voice sound lower and heavier. Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production. On recording a new song, Stevens said, [...] "the pressure's sort of off — but it's also on — because it doesn't have to sound like it did before, but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that's already pretty great." [...] Stevens agreed that the song is [...] "a big, romantic, soaring number" [...] about the Beast lamenting [...] "I've fallen in love with her, and now she's buggered off, woe is me", while [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] is [...] "How am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love with her?" [...] Replacing [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with [...] "Evermore" [...] helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.|$|E

He explicitly told his followers not to be lured into violent confrontations, declaring, [...] "We aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into any trap. We aren't going to be provoked".
