Two 12. 2 -ha blocks containing Fawn, endophyte-free, tall fescue and red clover were each divided into 4 pastures of 2. 53 or 3. 54 ha. Hay was harvested from the pastures in June and August of 2003 and 2004, and N was applied at 50. 5 kg/ha at the initiation of stockpiling in August. On October 22, 2003, and October 20, 2004, twenty-four 30 -mo-old Angus-Simmental and Angus cows were allotted by BW and BCS to strip-graze for 147 d at 0. 84 or 1. 19 cow/ha. Eight similar cows were allotted to 2 <b>dry</b> <b>lots</b> and fed tall fescue-red clover hay ad libitum.

The study evaluated the heartwood presence, grain pattern, distance from pith, height within the tree, and effect of drying schedules. The wood color was measured by CIEL*a*b* systems. Wood color of Vochysia guatemalensis is a combination of different tonalities of lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*), however, the lightness and yellowness components were the dominant tones. The color of heartwood and sapwood were different before and after drying.

The L* index is only correlated with heartwood presence in undried wood.
