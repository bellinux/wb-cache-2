40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{innovation}} pathways of new creations from R & D activity through to intellectual property (IP) applications using <b>enterprise</b> <b>panel</b> data from 1989 to 2002. Our estimation method explicitly addresses the selection {{issues associated with}} missing R&D data which is a common problem among this type of data set. We find that R&D activity is a highly path dependent process that relies heavily on firm specific effects. These firm specific effects were subsequently found to be correlated with managerial style – more aggressive and intuitive managers have higher R&D ceteris paribus – and extensive use of incentive schemes for employees within the firm. In addition, we find that R&D is higher when the previous year’s enterprise debt ratio is lower, the speed of technological change is faster, the firm’s ability to absorb knowledge spillovers is greater and the product market is less contestable. Furthermore, these firms appear to be using the various methods of appropriation, IP and non-IP, as complementary packages to capture the quasi-rents from previous R&D expenditure rather than as substitutes. ...|$|E

However, this is only applicable for NFHEs in labour intensive and unskilled industries and the expansion of NFHEs in these industries did not go together with the improvement of their efficiency. On the other hand, NFHEs in the almost negatively affected manufacturing industries from trade liberalization had to face with the fiercer competition and many of them had to shutdown their operations. Nevertheless, the survived NFHEs had better and high performance and had more chance to become formal SMEs. We also find that the more openness and the lower tariff increased the NFHE income in the industry but these effects were not the same for NFHEs in different industries. There are some concerns for the future role and development of NFHEs in the face of increasing international competition in the market.

40|$|Most low- {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} have many small {{but only a}} few medium-sized and large enterprises. Small firms seem to have difficulties growing into medium-sized ones. This is problematic because medium-sized companies tend to be the main creators of higher quality and better-paid employment, motors of innovation and economic diversification, as well as future exporters. This study focuses on Egypt. It {{is based on the assumption}} that while companies grow for various reasons (such as a sudden increase in demand), the only strategy for growth that companies can control is growth through innovation – or ‘upgrading’. This study investigates the main constraints and success factors for small enterprise upgrading in Egypt.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of changing relations between business R&D (BERD), patents and output measures like value added and productivity (macro level) as well as EBIT and market capitalization (micro level) to analyze long-term/secular effects of technological change at different levels. The results of the panel data reveal an increase of the patent numbers resulting from R&D expenditures. However, we also find a difference in the elasticities of BERD and patents between patent-intensive and non-patent-intensive sectors. In addition, the association between patents and labor productivity falls when all sectors are taken into account, implying decreasing contributions of technological progress to the productivity. Yet, the drivers are non-patent-intensive sectors, as we observe an increasing association of patents and labor productivity for patent-intensive sectors. The results of the <b>enterprise</b> <b>panel</b> data reveal similar results. The correlations between R&D and patents increased over the last 20 years, although it seems there is a concentration of R&D and patenting activities to a smaller amount of firms, which can partially be {{explained by the fact that}} research and development that is necessary for a single patent has become more and more expensive in the past years...|$|E

Furthermore, {{for the first time the}} direction of causality in this relationship is investigated systematically by testing for self-selection of more productive firms into importing, and for productivity-enhancing effects of imports (‘learning-by-importing’). We find a positive link between importing and productivity. From an empirical model with fixed enterprise effects that controls for firm size, industry, and unobservable firm heterogeneity we see that the premia for trading internationally are about the same in West and East Germany. Compared to firms that do not trade at all two-way traders do have the highest premia, followed by firms that only export, while firms that only import have the smallest estimated premia. We find evidence for a positive impact of productivity on importing, pointing to self-selection of more productive enterprises into imports, but no evidence for positive effects of importing on productivity due to learning-by-importing. imports, exports, productivity, <b>enterprise</b> <b>panel</b> data, Germany...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of the effects of foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) on host countries, an interesting question that is highly relevant to government policy concerning FDI is whether the benefits of inward FDI both as öwn-firmëffects of FDI in foreign subsidiaries and positive spillover effects for other firms are captured to a larger extent by certain types of enterprises in the host economy? Are there particular characteristics (often called absorptive capacity, e. g. by Cohen, Levinthal 1989) that determine whether a firm can benefit from positive spillovers? In this paper I will try to assess these issues based on <b>enterprise</b> level <b>panel</b> data from Estonia. I find that for the total factor productivity effects of FDI at the subsidiary level, characteristics such as export or domestic market orientation of the affiliate may be important.

40|$|This paper investigates four cohorts {{of firms}} from German {{manufacturing}} industries that started to export {{in the years}} between 1998 and 2002 and follows them over the {{five years after the}} start. Export starters are a rare species and they are small on average compared to incumbent exporters. Between 30 percent and 40 percent of the starters became continuous exporters; some starters stepped out and back into exporting, many of them more than once. The share of total exports contributed by export starters of a cohort is tiny in the start year, and it remains so over the years to follow, although those starters that were exporters in year t+ 5 had a share of exports in total sales that was more than twice as high as the average share of exports in total sales among the export starters of the same cohort in year t. Contrary to the market selection hypothesis {{there is no evidence that}} productivity in the start year is systematically related to survival in the export market. There is no evidence for a negative impact of a smaller firm size in the start year on the chance to survive on the export market. Starting with a higher share of exports in total sales, however, tends to increase the probability to stay on the export market. export starters, post-entry performance, Germany, <b>enterprise</b> <b>panel</b> data...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses unique {{new data}} for German {{manufacturing}} enterprises from matched regular surveys {{and a special}} purpose survey to investigate the causal effect of relocation of activities to a foreign country on various dimensions of firm performance. Enterprises that relocated activities abroad in the period 2001 - 03 {{for the first time}} are compared to firms that did not relocate activities abroad before 2006. The comparison is performed for both 2004 (to document {{differences between the two groups}} of firms after some of them started to relocate abroad) and for 2000 (when none of them did relocate abroad). It turns out that, compared to non-offshoring firms, firms that relocated activities were larger and more productive, and had a higher share of exports in total sales. All these differences existed in 2000, the year before some firms started to relocate, and this points to self-selection of "better" firms into offshoring. This finding is in line with results from recent theoretical models and with results from other countries. To investigate the causal effects of relocation across borders on firm performance, six different variants of a matching approach of firms that did and did not start to relocate abroad in 2001 - 03 were performed based on a propensity score estimated using firm characteristics in 2000 and the change in the performance variable between 1997 and 2000. The performance of both groups was compared for 2004 - 06 when some firms were relocating firms and the others were not. Broadly in line with hypotheses derived from the literature there is no evidence that offshoring has a negative causal impact on employment in offshoring firms. The effect is positive and large for productivity, and weak evidence for a positive effect on the wage per employee, the proxy variable for human capital intensity used, is found. Contrary to what is often argued, therefore, we find no evidence for a negative causal effect of offshoring on employment in Germany or on other core dimensions of firm performance. offshoring, Germany, <b>enterprise</b> <b>panel</b> data...|$|E
40|$|Innovation {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} important role for economic growth, regional output and a successful sector restructuring. The development of an innovation {{is regarded as a}} complex, interactive, technical and social process involving not only producers but also users, scientists and policy makers. Accordingly, the geographical environment with its industry structure, the scientific community, the political level, the labor supply and the interplay of regional actors {{have a significant impact on}} the innovation process in a region. The complexity of the innovation process is also reflected in the task of promoting innovation. Against this background, the states of Berlin and Brandenburg develop jointly new innovation strategies. To test these strategies and to position the Capital Region in the competition for innovative businesses and skilled workers, it must be compared with the other German Metropolitan Areas. This task was content of the project "Development of a Berlin Innovation Panel (BIP) ", which was financially supported by the Technologiestiftung Berlin (TSB). The central objective of the project was to demonstrate the innovative importance of the Metropolitan Area Berlin-Brandenburg and its fields of competence. In addition, the innovation strategies of Berlin should be reviewed for their effectiveness. In the first step, a comparative assessment of innovation potential and performance of the Metropolitan Area Berlin-Brandenburg was made. Using a comprehensive set of indicators innovation input and output of the region were evaluated. The data stem from a number of relevant surveys at county level, e. g. the German Federal Statistical Office, the Mannheim <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Panel</b> and the European Patent Office. In a second step, appropriate methods for obtaining reliable data for future evaluation of innovation in Berlin and its fields of competence were identified and compared. In this context, possibilities of a meaningful national monitoring using available secondary statistics and relevant indicators for the fields of competence are discussed and reviewed with regard to their feasibility. In addition to an inventory of current innovation studies, interviews with representatives of the management of the six competence fields of Berlin and with other experts from the Senate Department for Economics, Technology and Women's Issues, the subsidy bank of the Federal Land of Berlin (IBB) and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Berlin (ICC Berlin) were conducted...|$|E
