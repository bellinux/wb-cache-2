500|$|In September 1954, {{he heard}} his minutes would be slashed, and after the second {{exhibition}} game, Pollard retired from the Eagles. As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally. He avoided the legal tangle by never officially signing with another team again, thus voiding the reserve clause on his contract. Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give me {{much of a chance}} to play... I carried the ball only 23 times in 12 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four <b>games</b> <b>last</b> <b>year)</b> gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, like last year, PSU {{is a bit of a}} wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{free agent}} in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million {{contract}} with the Chicago White Sox. [...] "I looked at the different opportunities that I had {{and this was a}} team that won 83 <b>games</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's {{going to be hard to}} replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E

Warren Moon, making his Seattle debut, was limited to seven completions and a pick while backup John Friesz was only slightly better with ten completions. The Jets posted only their fifth win (41-3 final) in their previous 40 games.|$|E

Both of Minnesota's tackles in 1935 were All-Americans. In addition to Smith, Ed Widseth played tackle for the 1935 tream and was a consensus All-American. The 1935 Golden Gophers, with Smith and Widseth in the line, finished the season undefeated and defeated 40-0 and Wisconsin, 33-7.

After a scoreless first quarter, Temple got a 10-0 halftime lead, then made it a 17-7 lead midway through the third after each scored, and Villanova scored to make it 17-14, but Temple would score again early in the 4th quarter to make it 24-14, but Villanova would shut out the Owls {{the rest of the}} way, making it 24-17 on a field goal soon after, late in the game Villanova tied it up, and just as Temple was about to go for the win, a turnover led to a Villanova field goal that gave them their first win of the year and put Temple at 0-1 to start the new year. It was also Villanova's first win against a I-A opponent since 2003, ironically it Temple. Villanova leads the series.|$|E
