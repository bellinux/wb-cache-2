5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|Separate {{from the}} main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five {{attributes}} (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> that form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E

40|$|The main impulse {{for this}} {{considerations}} {{is a beautiful}} Professor Adam Nowaczyk's text "The spell of Plato. Reflections on Roman Ingarden's ontology". My general (negative) thesis is that no hyper-dietetic, i. e. monocategorial, ontology (meant as the theory of real objects) is not correct. Thus neither the theory of sets (if <b>it</b> <b>assumed</b> {{the uniqueness of the}} ontic category of sets), nor reism (if <b>it</b> <b>assumed</b> the uniquenes of the ontic category of things) or eventism (if <b>it</b> <b>assumed</b> the uniqueness of the ontic category of events) are correct ontologies (meant as theses on existence of a certain ontic category). The consequence of this negative thesis is that only non-dietetic, i. e. polycategorial, ontology can be correct. I present a few arguments on account of theses two theses...|$|R
