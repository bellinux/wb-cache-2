60|$|There was a shout of {{laughter}} at this moment, occasioned {{by one of}} the firemen having accidentally turned the branch or <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> full on the faces of the crowd and drenched some of them. This was followed by a loud cheer when another fireman was seen to have clambered to the roof whence he could apply the water with better effect. At last their efforts were crowned with success. Before midnight the fire was extinguished, and we drove back to the Paddington Station at a more leisurely pace. Thus ended my first experience of a London fire.|$|E

Now if the flow rate is reduced to [...] by closing a control valve on the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe,</b> the static pressure upstream of the valve is increased.

50|$|Al-Jazari's suction {{piston pump}} could lift 13.6 metres of water, {{with the help}} of <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> This was more {{advanced}} than the suction pumps that appeared in 15th-century Europe, which lacked <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> It was not, however, any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{displacement}} lubricator {{was introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1860 by John Ramsbottom. It operates by allowing steam to enter a closed vessel containing oil. After condensing, the water sinks {{to the bottom of the}} vessel, causing the oil to rise and overflow into <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> The oil from the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> is introduced into the steam pipe, where it is atomised and carried to the valves and cylinders.|$|R
2500|$|... in 1942 a {{new type}} of top feed was introduced, with {{separate}} clackboxes in a taller cover, and internal <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> rather than trays.|$|R
50|$|A ram newly {{placed into}} {{operation}} or which has stopped cycling must be started as follows. If the waste valve {{is in the}} raised (closed) position, which is most common, it must be pushed down manually into the open position and released. If the flow is sufficient, it will then cycle at least once. If it does not continue to cycle, it must be pushed down repeatedly until it cycles continuously on its own, usually after three or four manual cycles. If the ram stops with the waste valve in the down (open) position it must be lifted manually and kept up {{for as long as}} necessary for the supply pipe to fill with water and for any air bubbles to travel up the pipe to the source. This may take a minute or more. Then it can be started manually by pushing it down a few times as described above. Having a valve on the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> at the ram makes starting easier. Close the valve until the ram starts cycling, then gradually open it to fill the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> If opened too quickly it will stop the cycling. Once the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> is full the valve can be left open.|$|E
5000|$|On diesel and {{electric}} locomotives and railcars, sandboxes were and are fitted {{close to the}} wheels so as to achieve the shortest possible length of <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> [...] Depots may have a sand drier installed to warm and to dry the sand before it is used.|$|E
50|$|This drop in {{pressure}} upon valve closure {{also helps to}} avoid the effects of water hammer within the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> This can, if uncontrolled, cause the injector valve to bounce upon its seat and encourage dribble, or even to cause work hardening and eventual fracture to the pipework.|$|E
50|$|A {{sophisticated}} electronically controlled multi-point {{fuel injection}} system ensures precision fuel delivery. The electronic throttle control system (throttle-by-wire) eliminates the mechanical linkage between the accelerator pedal and the throttle plate. Looping the fuel line around the engine improves exhaust gas performance by reducing fuel temperature differences between the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes,</b> reducing pulsations within the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes,</b> and suppressing variations {{in the amount of}} fuel injected. A combination of the MIVEC - a variable valve timing and lift system - and a two-stage variable intake manifold ensure a broad torque curve. The 6B31 provides nearly 90 percent of peak torque from just 2,000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Citing the Byzantine siphon {{used for}} {{discharging}} Greek fire as an inspiration, al-Jazari {{went on to}} describe the first suction pipes, suction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> The <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> are joined above {{the centre of the}} machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: ...|$|R
50|$|The next version built was the B6sa, 55 {{of which}} were built at Altoona during 1913 - 1914. These had radial-stay fireboxes, common {{elsewhere}} but rare on the Pennsylvania, and they replaced the Stephenson gear with the more modern Walschaerts valve gear. Steam <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> were outside, like all other PRR modern power. All were built superheated.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} use of fiber pipe {{was in an}} {{experimental}} water <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> in the Boston area. The pipeline, finished in 1867, measured 1.5 miles in length and was in use through 1927. Bitumenized pipe was not in widespread commercial use until the late 19th century when it was utilized exclusively as electrical conduit.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the pop {{function}} of this valve is unimportant, as the fuel injector itself contains a similar valve. Control {{of the opening}} of the injector and the first fuel delivery is important, but this is best handled at the injector end of the pipe, thus avoided time delays as fuel propagates through the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{much less}} {{critical}} since the pressure vessel prevents water hammer effects from traveling up it. Its overall design would {{be determined by the}} allowable pressure drop based on the expected flow. Typically the pipe size will be about half that of the supply pipe, but for very long runs a larger size may be indicated. PVC pipe and any necessary valves are not a problem.|$|E
5000|$|In 1559, Taqi al-Din {{invented a}} six-cylinder 'Monobloc' pump. It was a hydropowered water-raising machine {{incorporating}} valves, suction and <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes,</b> piston rods with lead weights, trip levers with pin joints, and cams on the axle of a water-driven scoop-wheel. His 'Monobloc' pump could also create a partial vacuum, which was formed [...] "as the lead weight moves upwards, it pulls the piston with it, creating vacuum which sucks the water through a non return clack valve into the piston cylinder." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1930 100 {{more were}} ordered; this class M1a had several improvements. Instead of {{separate}} cylinder block and smokebox saddle castings, the M1a had a one-piece casting (first {{seen on the}} K5 Pacific) with inside steam <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes,</b> instead of the outside, visible pipes of the M1. A Worthington feedwater heater was installed, with a boxlike mixing chamber behind the stack. Twin cross-compound air compressors were hung {{next to each other}} on the left side, instead of the single compressor of the M1. The M1a locomotives had larger tenders than the previous locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{distinguishing}} features of P-7 were the 670-yard-long elliptical high-sloped sand {{wall and the}} wide concrete-lined trench (flame pit) with a large symmetrical water-cooled flame deflector of molybdenum-steel pipes. [...] The concrete trench, nearly [...] wide with [...] concrete walls, sloped gradually away from {{each side of the}} flame deflector to a depth of , rising again symmetrically toward the side of the arena. [...] Beside the flame pit was a long underground room where [...] diameter <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> were housed to route cooling water at 120 gallon per second from three huge pumps in the pumphouse to the flame deflector in the pit.|$|R
50|$|A {{simplified}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{is shown in}} Figure 2. Initially, the waste valve 4 is open, and the delivery valve 5 is closed. The water in the inlet pipe 1 starts to flow under {{the force of gravity}} and picks up speed and kinetic energy until the increasing drag force closes the waste valve. The momentum of the water flow in the inlet pipe against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the delivery valve 5, and forces some water to flow into the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the inlet pipe to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the inlet pipe. This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocating pumps {{move the}} fluid using {{one or more}} {{oscillating}} pistons, plungers, or membranes (diaphragms), while valves restrict fluid motion to the desired direction. In order for suction to take place, the pump must first pull the plunger in an outward motion to decrease pressure in the chamber. Once the plunger pushes back, it will increase the pressure chamber and the inward pressure of the plunger will then open the discharge valve and release the fluid into the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> at a high velocity.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{cylindrical}} valve has closed, the spring presses it still further {{down through the}} seat. There is a small distance between {{the point where the}} {{cylindrical valve}} first closes, and where the mitre valve finally closes. This has the effect of slightly increasing the volume of the closed-off volume, including the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> As liquids are near-incompressible, even this tiny change in volume has the effect of dropping the pressure in the pipe. This drop in pressure allows the injector valve to close fully, without leakage or dribble.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} was limited chiefly {{to the region}} of high angles of attack since {{it is only in}} this region that any considerable change in the character of the flow can be expected from such artificial aids. The slot, through which compressed air was blown, was formed by two pieces of sheet steel connected by screws at intervals of about 5 cm. It was intended to regulate the width of the slot by means of these screws. Much more compressed air was required than was originally supposed, hence all the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> were much too small. This experiment, therefore, is to be regarded as only a preliminary one...|$|R
50|$|Two {{distinguishing}} features of P-7 were the 670-yard-long elliptical high-sloped sand {{wall and the}} wide concrete-lined trench (flame pit) with a large symmetrical water-cooled flame deflector of molybdenum-steel pipes. The concrete trench, nearly 25 ft wide with 3 ft concrete walls, sloped gradually away from {{each side of the}} flame deflector to a depth of 20 ft, rising again symmetrically toward the side of the arena. Beside the flame pit was a long underground room where 4 ft diameter <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> were housed to route cooling water at 120 gallon per second from three huge pumps in the pumphouse to the flame deflector in the pit.|$|R
50|$|The sand may be {{delivered}} by gravity, by a steam-blast (steam locomotives) or by compressed air. Gravity sanding {{requires that the}} sand be dry so that it runs freely. Locomotives used multiple sandboxes, so that their <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> could be short and near-vertical. Engine sheds in the UK were equipped with sand drying stoves, so that sandboxes could be refilled each morning with dry sand. Steam locomotives in the USA had a single sandbox, called a sand dome {{on top of the}} boiler where the rising heat helped to dry the sand. Even with this arrangement, sand pipes tended to clog, and by the 1880s, pneumatic sanding systems were being proposed.|$|R
50|$|Most large drip {{irrigation}} systems employ {{some type of}} filter to prevent clogging of the small emitter flow path by small waterborne particles. New technologies are now being offered that minimize clogging. Some residential systems are installed without additional filters, since potable water is already filtered at the water treatment plant. Virtually all {{drip irrigation}} equipment manufacturers recommend that filters be employed and generally will not honor warranties unless this is done. Last line filters just before the final <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> are strongly recommended in addition to any other filtration system due to fine particle settlement and accidental insertion of particles in the intermediate lines.|$|E
5000|$|A {{traditional}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{has only two}} moving parts, a spring or weight loaded [...] "waste" [...] valve sometimes known as the [...] "clack" [...] valve and a [...] "delivery" [...] check valve, making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The Papa hydraulic ram pump also has only two moving parts. However, these are not mechanical but instead rely on the elastomeric properties of the main valve and non-return valve which are low-cost, reliable and easy to replace. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source and a <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe,</b> taking {{a portion of the}} water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.|$|E
50|$|Suction {{and lift}} are {{important}} considerations when pumping fluids. Suction is the vertical {{distance between the}} fluid to be pumped and {{the centre of the}} pump, while lift is the vertical distance between the pump and the delivery point. The depth from which a hand pump will suck is limited by atmospheric pressure to an operating depth of less than 7 meters. The height to which a hand pump will lift is governed by the ability of the pump and the operator to lift the weight in the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> Thus the same pump and operator will be able to achieve a greater lift with a smaller diameter pipe than they could with a larger diameter pipe.|$|E
40|$|In Australian industry, {{centralised}} lubrication systems {{are used to}} deliver grease to various mechanical components, usually bearings. In many situations, {{the length of the}} delivery lines is in excess of 20 metres. These lines meander through other pieces of equipment and infrastructure. In some situations when these lines are attached to support devices that are subject to vibration, the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> have become “plugged” because the oil in the grease has leaked/separated from the grease matrix. This scenario is very costly to the owner/operator of the equipment as a lack of lubrication can cause major repair/maintenance costs. A laboratory test procedure has been devised to evaluate the suitability of various greases to remain stable under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{refers to}} a non {{dimensional}} analysis of the behaviour of a hydraulic system during pump fast start-ups. The system is composed of a radial flow pump and its suction and <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> It is modelled using the bond graph methodology. The prediction of the model is validated by comparison to experimental results. An analysis of the time evolution of the terms acting on the total pump pressure is proposed. It allows for a decomposition of the start-up into three consecutive periods. The time scales associated with these periods are estimated. The effects of parameters (angular acceleration, final rotation speed, pipe length and resistance) affecting the start-up rapidity are then explored...|$|R
40|$|GeochemicaJ {{models are}} useful to {{calculate}} the distribution and activities of mineral species present in groundwater. The study area Salem district is underlain by Archaean crystalline metamorphic complex. Normally the groundwater occurs up {{to a depth of}} 300 m below ground level. So groundwater is exploited using compressor fitted purripsets. As the groundwater is saturated with calcium carbonate, the use of compressor air disturbs the equilibrium condition of calcium carbonate with groundwater and ultimately scale formation takes place in the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes.</b> Generally oversaturated minerals tend to form as scales especially calcium carbonate. Groundwater from 60 locations were collected and analysed for major and minor ions. The geochemical model PHREEQE has been used to findout the disequilibrium indices of calcite along with other minerals.

50|$|Combustible gas, {{mixed with}} air, is {{supplied}} into the combustion chamber and then fired by an electric spark. The {{force of the}} expanding gas drives water downwards from the combustion chamber and accelerates it along the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe.</b> Once the chamber pressure drops {{to that of the}} inlet water, the delivered water is no longer being accelerated but the large mass of water in the long pipe continues to flow by its own inertia. This reduces the pressure in the chamber below atmospheric, which causes the inlet air and gas valves to open, drawing in fresh air as a scavenging effect. As the water begins to flow back down the U, this increases the chamber pressure and causes the exhaust valves to open.|$|E

50|$|This was {{specifically}} devised {{to deal with}} the highly corrosive sulfuric acid, but was extended to other corrosive substances. It was traditionally made of ceramic (to be corrosion resistant) and spherical in shape (to withstand the pressure) thus giving its name.A cylindrical version (with hemispherical ends) was described by Swindin, being 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet long, holding 40 cubic feet of acid.In principle, the vessel is part filled with liquid, which is then expelled by pumping in compressed air. The liquid outlet is via a pipe from the top going down almost {{to the bottom of the}} vessel. When the acid egg is emptied, connections to the compressor and the <b>delivery</b> <b>pipe</b> are closed by valves, the air pressure is vented and the vessel refilled with acid.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} theoretical results obtained for a mechanical Diesel fuel injection system, {{made up of}} a distributor-type pump, four <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> and four four-hole injectors. Pressure in the pumping chamber, in two locations along the fuel line and within the injector is measured directly, as well as the injector needle lift. The flow rate is evaluated through the measure of pressure in the injection chamber. Experimental results are sustained by theoretical results. The numerical model considers systems of ordinary differential equations representing the operation of injector, pump, delivery valve and line volume elements. Only a few model details are presented. Similar approaches are in use by many years, and the accuracy they provide is generally accepted to be fairly good. Theoretical and experimental results are presented vs. the time at different pump speeds, showing a very satisfactory accuracy. The main objective of the paper is to describe the unsteady flow within the injector, and to show differences with reference to the steady flow. Despite the subject is not adequately covered in the open literature, several reasons suggest that steady and unsteady flow behaviors differ considerably. These differences may affect the prediction of both injection pressure and flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Drinking water {{temperature}} was measured continuously {{for one year}} on 22 pig farms in South Australia (SA) and Queensland (QLD) and data were collected on major housing features and management factors employed in individual piggery buildings. The data collected enabled the likely effects of housing and management factors on resulting {{water temperature}} to be quantified and the industry to {{be made aware of}} the importance of providing drinking water within optimal temperature range for efficient pig production and welfare. The data collected identified statistically significant housing and management factors associated with and contributing to sub-optimal water temperature as seasons (P= 0. 0001), source of water (P= 0. 0001), position of piping (P= 0. 003), water pressure (P= 0. 042), size of in-shed water reservoir (P= 0. 0001) and diameter of the main (P= 0. 0001) and <b>delivery</b> <b>pipes</b> (P = 0. 0001). A controlled experiment was also conducted to complement these findings by quantifying the negative effect of sub-optimal (warm) drinking water temperature on pig growth rate. Two identical weaner rooms were selected for the on-farm study. Genetics, nutrition, management, stocking rate and density were identical for both groups. Pigs in the treatment group received water heated to 28. 3 ± 0. 4 °C while the control group received unheated water at 17. 8 ± 0. 9 °C. Growth rate was suppressed by 58 grams/day in the group receiving the heated water. These results demonstrate the negative effect of warm water temperature on pig production and highlight potential ways of reducing the likelihood of providing warm drinking water to livestock. T.
