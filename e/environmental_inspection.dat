40|$|In this paper, an {{accurate}} range sensor for the three-dimensional reconstruction of environments is designed and developed. Following {{the principles of}} laser profilometry, the device exploits a set of optical transmitters able to project a laser line on the environment. A high-resolution and high-frame-rate camera assisted by a telecentric lens collects the laser light reflected by a parabolic mirror, whose shape is designed ad hoc to achieve a maximum measurement error of 10 mm when the target is placed 3 m away from the laser source. Measurements are derived {{by means of an}} analytical model, whose parameters are estimated during a preliminary calibration phase. Geometrical parameters, analytical modeling and image processing steps are validated through several experiments, which indicate the capability of the proposed device to recover the shape of a target with high accuracy. Experimental measurements show Gaussian statistics, having standard deviation of 1. 74 mm within the measurable range. Results prove that the presented range sensor is a good candidate for <b>environmental</b> <b>inspections</b> and measurements...|$|R

Results obtained revealed that lack of communication led to conflict between the environmental inspectors and the economic operators. Strategies were used by both the inspectors and their clients to avoid conflict or to avoid misunderstanding escalating in to conflict. It was also revealed that the clients saw the inspectors as having power of sanctioning them, and that trust existed between the inspectors and their clients. One other finding was that environmental inspections made use of participatory approach. This ensured that the opinions of both the inspectors and their clients were taken in to account during inspection thus making it possible for the exploration of both parties' perspective...|$|E

40|$|In {{collaboration}} {{with a state}} environmental regulator in India, we conducted a field exper-iment to raise the frequency of <b>environmental</b> <b>inspections</b> to the prescribed minimum for a random set of industrial plants. The treatment was successful when judged by process measures, as treatment plants, relative to the control group, were {{more than twice as}} likely to be inspected and to be cited for violating pollution standards. Yet the treatment was weaker for more consequential outcomes: the regulator was no more likely to identify ex-treme polluters (i. e., plants with emissions five times the regulatory standard or more) or to impose costly penalties in the treatment group. In response to the added scrutiny, treatment plants only marginally increased compliance with standards and did not significantly reduce mean pollution emissions. To explain these results and recover the full costs of environmental regulation, we model the regulatory process as a dynamic discrete game where the regulator chooses whether to penalize and plants choose whether to abate to avoid future sanctions. We estimate this model using original data on 10, 000 interactions between plants and the regulator. Our estimates imply that the costs of environmental regulation are largely re...|$|R
