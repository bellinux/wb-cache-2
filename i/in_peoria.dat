5|$|Benet's band program, {{practically}} nonexistent in {{the late}} 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies. Participation in the marching band also increased after the school became coeducational, since there were more musicians willing to play instruments male students saw as feminine. Out of 1,275students at Benet in 1999–00, 130 were choir students and 115 were band students. Instrumental groups include two concert bands, a percussion ensemble, three jazz bands, a marching band, a pep band, and a string orchestra. In 1998 the pep band was one of eight schools chosen {{from a pool of}} 58 to perform at the state basketball tournament. In 2002, the school's symphonic band was one of three high school bands invited to play at the Illinois Music Educators Association All-State Conference <b>in</b> <b>Peoria.</b> Vocal music groups include five choirs, one of which is a student-led mass choir that participates in school liturgies.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory <b>in</b> <b>Peoria,</b> Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting.

Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA <b>in</b> <b>Peoria,</b> Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by acquiring rights to its ABC and CW programming, and moving them to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South Bend to Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E

5|$|Thome grew up <b>in</b> <b>Peoria,</b> Illinois, {{as part of}} a large blue-collar {{family of}} athletes, who {{predominantly}} played baseball and basketball.

With the Indians, Thome w{{as part of a}} core of players that led the franchise to two World Series appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. He spent over a decade with Cleveland before leaving via free agency after the 2002 season to join the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he spent the following three seasons. Traded to the Chicago White Sox before the 2006 season, Thome won the American League Comeback Player of the Year Award that year and reached the 500 home run club during his three-season tenure with the team. By this point in his career, back pain limited Thome to being a designated hitter.

Upon retiring, Thome accepted an executive position with the White Sox.|$|E
5|$|Future stops {{included}} Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit, {{among other}} locations. Starting with the St. Joseph's game, the Webfoots had a streak {{in which they}} played four games in five days before Christmas Eve. On December 20, Oregon routed Miami (Ohio) 74–38, as Sarpola led the team with 20 points. Wintermute suffered an ankle injury during the game. The Webfoots then defeated Canisius by a 12-point margin. In the next game, against an undefeated Wayne State team, the Webfoots entered halftime tied at 22–22 and needed a late burst of scoring, led by Gale and Johansen, to clinch an 11-point victory. After the Miami (Ohio) game, Wintermute missed three of the team's following four games. The Webfoots won without him in their next two games, {{but not in the}} game in which he returned to action against Bradley. <b>In</b> <b>Peoria,</b> Illinois, Oregon fell behind by 17 points at halftime and lost 52–39, as Bradley center Dar Hutchins tallied 17 points while defended by Wintermute, who was playing through his ankle injury. Following their loss to Bradley, Oregon traveled to the Chicago Coliseum for a game against Western Illinois State Teachers College. Despite being without the services of Wintermute again, the Webfoots posted a 60–45 victory. Drake, the Webfoots' opponent on December 29 in Chicago, was defeated by 11 points. The final game of the road trip, held in San Francisco on New Year's Eve, saw the Webfoots lose to Stanford. The stretch proved profitable for the school, which made $4,400 off of the East Coast games, and Dick credited the trip for giving the Webfoots exposure to different styles of play than they had been accustomed to.|$|E
