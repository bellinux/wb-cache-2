25|$|Rico's crimes {{started with}} {{allowing}} gangs {{to operate as}} long as they stayed 'quiet'. This soon escalated to allowing guilty perps to remain free, unjudicial relations and drinking, taking bribes from organised crime, running blackmail operations, protection rackets, killing perps that had surrendered (and faking the charges) and brutalising innocent people to get 'confessions'. As he had a <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> rate, Justice Department didn't look at him too closely. Joe's efforts to persuade Rico to change his ways fell on deaf ears and much to Joe's distate, he found himself turning to Rico on occasion for information on underworld figures. When Judge Kenner, Rico's former Assessing Judge, became suspicious, Rico secretly murdered him and dumped the body in a rad pit. He started to live in an Oldtown apartment, flaunting his money and corruption.|$|E
25|$|The benthic {{community}} {{has taken on}} a disproportionately large role in the food web ecology of the estuary due to key invasions by bivalves. The use of these clams, the Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis) has a wide salinity tolerance that extends into the low salinity zone, but not into freshwater. It filter feeds on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, such as calanoid copepod nauplii. The clam has few predators in the San Francisco Estuary and this allows it to grow to high densities (on the order of tens of thousands/m2). Because of its <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> rates, it is capable of clearing the entire water column of portions of the estuary in a few days, leading to drastically depleted plankton populations. This is thought to be the main cause of a decline in ecosystem productivity after the invasion of the clams in the mid-1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The attackers were {{reported}} to have smuggled explosives into Saudi Arabia from Lebanon. Al-Mughassil, Al-Houri, Al-Sayegh, Al-Qassab, and the unidentified Lebanese man bought a large petrol tanker truck in early June 1996 in Saudi Arabia. Over a two-week period they converted it into a truck bomb. The group now had about [...] of plastic explosives, enough to produce a shaped charge that detonated with the force of at least [...] of TNT, according to a later assessment of the Defense Special Weapons Agency. The power of the blast was magnified several ways. The truck itself shaped the charge by directing the blast toward the building. Moreover, the relatively <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> between the truck and the ground gave it the more lethal characteristics of an air burst.|$|E

2500|$|Like Model T {{cars and}} trucks, the Fordson tractor {{provided}} {{the basis for}} a large and varied aftermarket in accessories and conversions. A pair of articles in a 1922 issue of the Chilton Tractor Journal describes the business environment and gives photographs of many of the attachments and conversions available. As with most other tractors, farmers and construction contractors could buy aftermarket governors, ignition parts, hitches and drawbars; but with the Fordson especially, one could buy a crawler tractor, road grader, or self-propelled combine built by an aftermarket firm that used the Fordson essentially as a platform. For example, the original Gleaner self-propelled combines were built by attaching the combine to a Fordson. At least 3 companies offered crawler conversions, and others offered enlarged cleats, including the [...] "overgrown tire chain" [...] type that had led to crawler development not long before. Several companies converted Fordsons to road graders; the Wehr (...) is well remembered. [...] The first tricycle cultivator version of the Fordson was available as an aftermarket conversion by the Moline Implement Company as early as 1920 or 1921, [...] which was 3 to 4 years before the Farmall was introduced, a full decade before Dearborn prototyped the Fordson All-Around, [...] and a full decade and a half before Ford Ltd produced that model. It lacked those tractors' <b>high</b> <b>clearance</b> but was otherwise prescient.|$|E
2500|$|Development of new Fordson/Ford {{tractors}} in the U.S. remained mostly inactive {{for about}} 10 {{years after the}} end of U.S. production, although Ford did experiment with a number of designs during the 1930s. Most of them never left the drawing board, which was intentional; Henry Ford was interested in continuing R (and continued paying Ford engineers to work on it), although he wasn't going to put any models into production until all conditions (design, market) were right for commercial success. A Fordson row-crop model, essentially a [...] "Fordson version of the Farmall" [...] with tricycle design and <b>high</b> <b>clearance,</b> was prototyped at Dearborn in 1930-1931 but waited until 1936 to be produced, when Ford Ltd of Britain produced it as the Fordson All-Around. (It was not without precedent, for the aftermarket had presaged it, although not with the high clearance; in 1939, Ford filed a patent for raising and lowering the clearance on the fly.) The idea of variable front track for row-crop tractors was also considered at Ford during this era. Achieving it via pivoting cantilevered wheel mounts was one of the options, although Ford never put that method into production (it later reached production in the form of the Avery Ro-Trak in 1938). The thought devoted to the topic paid off later, when the Ford 9N achieved it with another, simpler method. Between 1928 and 1932, Henry Ford's attention became consumed mostly by the development and introduction of his company's first V8 engine, which was introduced by Ford on March 31, 1932 and was an immediate success in Ford cars and trucks. Experimental V8-powered tractor prototypes were built, but no production occurred.|$|E
