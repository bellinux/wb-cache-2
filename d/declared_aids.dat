40|$|Like tuberculosis, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social ine-qualities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) {{for the care of}} patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings.

Still, AIDS had not crossed the threshold to becoming a household name. Only with the passing of Rock Hudson did AIDS gain a face, an identity.

RATIONALE: With the ending of apartheid and the rise of HIV/Aids, there has been a clear crisis of masculinity in the wake of social change. Government response to the epidemic has been ambiguous. Fana Khaba, aka Yfm DJ Khabzela, was the first young black celebrity to publicly <b>declare</b> he had <b>Aids.</b> I plan to follow his story and to look at HIV/Aids campaigns and to examine why they are not working. METHODOLOGY: Through a literature review, an examination of statistics and public health messaging on HIV/Aids and my investigation into the life of Fana Khaba, I will show the complexities currently not being considered in the compilation of public health messaging. The reason I chose to follow the story of Fana Khaba is because I am a South African deeply concerned about HIV/Aids. I found his life compelling because it encapsulated so much of the rapid and intense culture shift that followed the arrival of democracy in 1994. And because his life echoed that of a pivotal generation in the apartheid struggle: the generation who grew up in Soweto in the seventies and eighties and came to adulthood with democracy. The so-called “lost generation” who later became known as the “Y generation”, they are deeply affected by the pandemic. I intend to show that Fana Khaba was a hugely popular iconic figure for the generation because he spoke to their aspirations and their anxieties. I will argue that because his life experience resonated so strongly with this generation, it is reasonable to draw more general lessons from it. The chief executive officer of Yfm was a friend of mine and, through him, I am able to gain access to Khabzela, his family, friends and colleagues at Yfm. This is an exceptional opportunity to gain an inside view of a life not readily available to relative outsiders such as myself. Clearly there is an ethical issue here. I will at all times keep my interviewees informed about the purpose of my research. I hope to help shed light on this anguished, important and under-debated sphere of life in South Africa [...] The format I choose is part investigative journalism, part biography. The {{reason for this is that}} I have worked as a journalist for 25 years so all my skills and training point me in that direction. I wanted to make it accessible in order to reach as many people as possible. The narrative-biographical form is conducive to this because it is easy to engage with. In order to give the narrative tension and focus, I shall repeatedly employ the central question of why Fana Khaba refused to take the anti-retrovirals which might have saved his life...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the village}} chronicle, {{municipal}} council decided as early as 1880 {{to build a new}} schoolhouse. In the years that followed, though, the financing arrangements for it must {{have turned out to be}} impossible. The schoolchildren still had to attend the very poorly housed school at the parish hall, where the Catholic schoolteacher from Genheim held classes. In 1884, a problem arose with the schoolteacher Auerbach: he had “suddenly become flighty”. The Schweppenhausen schoolteacher Weppler had to stand in for him in Roth. The Evangelical schoolchildren may well have gone to school in Stromberg. The “Royal Government” seems to have slowly come to see Roth’s scholastic circumstances as unacceptable, and so in 1885, the government wanted to found a Genheim-Roth school association. The municipality, though, fought for its own school, and for a while, the people’s petitions and their promise to accommodate the schoolchildren properly met with some success. Then, however, came the decree on 7 January 1887 that got the villagers up in arms: the Catholic schoolchildren were transferred to the Genheim Catholic school; the municipality also had to bear yearly school costs of 300 ℳ and also “for fire, 300 Wellen (standardized faggots) made free and small”. The municipality found this sum unfair given the state “educational endowment” that had been transferred to the neighbouring village. Three hundred marks was a heavy burden on Roth’s flimsy civic budget, for under the new schooling arrangement, the municipality was no longer allowed to levy the 45 ℳ that it had been customary to exact from Catholic parents for their children’s schooling. The upshot was a long, drawn-out legal battle with Genheim; even the district chairman Agricola could not settle it. Possibly because of these circumstances, municipal council, headed by reeve Martin Heinrich and represented by councillors Partenheimer, Höning, Leinberger, Kruger, Piroth I and Sturm, with the prospect of certain <b>aid,</b> <b>declared</b> themselves ready on 30 October 1891 to plan specially the building of a “Catholic schoolhouse” in Roth. The plans to convert the parish hall were turned aside for lack of an acceptable means of housing the schoolteacher (it was only in 1938 that the old bakehouse was torn down and built anew, together with the oven). For 1,084 ℳ, the municipality acquired the land that it needed on the Geißhübel (a street). Roth bricklayer Eßner II’s cost estimate was accepted. The chronicle says that the actual building cost was 17,000 ℳ, a sum to which the municipality itself only had to contribute some 1,500 ℳ. It had quite likely been cost-effective to make the bricks by firing earth that had been dug up right on the site. Nevertheless, the financing turned out to be anything but simple, for in 1893, grants that were not paid out in time made it necessary for Roth to seek a loan, at 4% interest, from the municipality of Schöneberg. After the building was finished, the Catholic schoolteacher from Genheim was transferred to Roth, and now Genheim’s few Catholic schoolchildren had to walk to school in Roth (this “tradition” was also revived in the years after the Second World War when a Catholic denominational school was built in Roth). The Evangelical schoolchildren living in Roth seemingly also henceforth attended the new school in Roth. In 1966, a fire - believed to have been caused by arson - destroyed the schoolroom and other parts of the building. Irreplaceable was the village and school chronicle that had been being kept by successive schoolteachers. This was irretrievably lost in the fire. The building’s instant reconstruction and the procurement of new school furniture, however, could not stand in the way of school politics, for the old one-room schoolhouses had already been sentenced to death. After the last village schoolteacher, Deptowicz, had been relocated, lessons at the Roth school were given only by stand-in teachers. Parents’ and municipal council’s petitions met with no success. Also unsuccessful was the petition against the directive to dissolve the village school on 1 August 1967 and bus the schoolchildren to either the Waldalgesheim Catholic denominational school or the Stromberg Christian interdenominational school that had been opened on 1 February 1966. So, the school at Roth, which had been dedicated in the autumn of 1894 shut its doors for good on 31 July 1967. Roth’s schoolchildren were thereafter schooled in neighbouring Stromberg. The use of a school bus to get there, however, seemed to be cold comfort to the municipality against the loss of their school. Since 1972, however, the educational offerings for children from Roth have improved. Children aged 3 to 5 have since been attending the kindergarten in Stromberg sponsored by the Catholic Church. Although at first the parents had to arrange for their children’s transportation to and from the kindergarten, state law has now mandated free transportation by bus. The municipality, however, must now pay the proportionate cost of this transportation.|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to <b>declare</b> certain <b>aids</b> compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R
