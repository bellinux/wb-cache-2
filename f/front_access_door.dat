5000|$|Some models, {{like the}} Goggomobil T250 and the BMW Isetta {{came in a}} couple of trim versions. The Goggomobil {{appeared}} in a closed roof, austerely basic model as well as an open [...] "cloth" [...] roofed fancy decor version with whitewall tyres and chrome grille, which was probably not the popular model with less affluent German consumers of the real car just following World War II. The Isetta is appealing in miniature with opening <b>front</b> <b>access</b> <b>door</b> and 'tilt-away' steering wheel. The model also features a removable side panel next to the location of the tiny engine. The BMW was available in several colors - with and without rear luggage rack and also in a special yellow 'Bundespost' (German Mail) version.Some of the larger vehicles featured have been the mid-1950s Mercedes-Benz 180 [...] "ponton" [...] sedan and a variety of European Fords, mainly from the 1960s. The postwar decade cars' interiors are consistently authentically decorated in period grey and white colours typical of the austerity of the times. A couple of more modern diecast models have been a VW Scirocco, BMW 850i coupe and an Acura NSX. Generally, German Revell diecast models all have opening doors, hoods and trunks.|$|E
40|$|Fire-fighting {{training}} rarely {{takes place}} in severe post-flashover environments, which is the likely scenario to be encountered {{by the time of}} first suppression attack on residential fires by fire-fighters. The tests were instrumented with thermocouple arrays, heated sampling probes and online FTIR and other gas analysis equipment. The compartment was a typical room enclosure with ventilation through a corridor to the <b>front</b> <b>access</b> <b>door</b> and a fire load representative of a typical residential “living-room”. The fire was allowed to reach flashover and become fully developed before the involvement of the fire-fighting team. Temperatures and toxic emissions were monitored throughout the fire development and extinguishment. This research demonstrates that with appropriate planning and suitable instrumentation target fire conditions and environments can be generated and fire-fighting tactics can be objectively monitored and assessed, providing realistic training, and other useful research data at the same time...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects and {{consequences}} of fire-fighting operations on the main characteristics of a fully-developed compartment fire. It also presents data and evaluation of the conditions to which fire-fighters are exposed. A typical room enclosure was used with ventilation through a corridor to the <b>front</b> <b>access</b> <b>door.</b> The fire load was wooden pallets. Flashover was reached and the fire became fully developed before {{the involvement of the}} fire-fighting team. The progression of the fire-fighters through the corridor and the main-room suppression attack - in particular the effect of short, medium and long water pulses on either the hot gas layer or the fire seat - was charted against the compartment temperatures, heat release rates, oxygen levels and toxic species concentrations. The fire fighting team was exposed to extreme conditions, heat fluxes in excess of 35 kW/m 2 and temperatures of the order of 250 oC even at crouching level. The fire equivalence ratio showed rich burning with high toxic emissions in particular of CO and unburnt hydrocarbons very early in the fire history and a stabilisation of the equivalence ratio at about 1. 8. The fire fighting operations made the combustion temporarily richer and the emissions even higher...|$|E

5000|$|The present St John's Land {{was erected}} {{sometime}} between 1766 and 1768 by John, the second Earl of Hopetoun. [...] It {{was part of}} his scheme which included the development of tenements along the eastern side of what is now St John Street. This was a prestigious development unusual in Edinburgh at that time consisting as it did of three or four storey tenements each with its own <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> <b>Access</b> to St John's Street from the Canongate was through a wide pend (1768).|$|R
2500|$|In 1961, several {{aircraft}} companies {{began studying}} heavy jet transport designs that {{would replace the}} Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and complement Lockheed C-141 Starlifters. In addition to higher overall performance, the United States Army wanted a transport aircraft with a larger cargo bay than the C-141, whose interior {{was too small to}} carry a variety of their outsized equipment. These studies led to the [...] "CX-4" [...] design concept, but in 1962 the proposed six-engine design was rejected, because it was not viewed as a significant advance over the C-141. By late 1963, the next conceptual design was named CX-X. It was equipped with four engines, instead of six engines in the earlier CX-4 concept. The CX-X had a gross weight of , a maximum payload of [...] and a speed of Mach0.75 (...) [...] The cargo compartment was [...] wide by [...] high and [...] long with <b>front</b> and rear <b>access</b> <b>doors.</b> To meet the power and range specifications with only four engines required a new engine with dramatically improved fuel efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Specific {{properties}} {{are used to}} comprehend and define big data, including volume, variety, velocity, variability, value and complexity. Katal et al. [5] state that these properties, notably associated with big data, make modeling and analysis of such data with traditional methods difficult. More specifically, traditional methods may have difficulty coping with high volume data, the diversity of data formats, the speed of data coming from various sources, inconsistencies of data flows, the filtering of important data, and the linking and transforming of data [5]. To differentiate between non-big-data and big-data, we refer to the former as traditional data in this paper. An example of traditional data could be a dataset of 5000 instances collected {{over a period of}} 1  month for a small company, where each instance represents the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>access</b> record of an employee of the company. In contrast, an example of big data could be a dataset of several million or more weather forecast reference points for collecting real-time weather data, or Medicare claims records collected from providers over several years [6]. The increasing reliance on big data applications worldwide makes a case for developing effective and efficient ways to extract knowledge from this type of data. Class imbalance plagues traditional data as well as big data; however, with the latter, the mal-effects can be felt much more severely due to the extreme degrees of class imbalance [7].|$|R

50|$|Overhead {{variable}} message {{signs are}} today available in three form factors: <b>front</b> <b>access,</b> rear access, and walk-in. In a <b>front</b> <b>access</b> variable message sign, maintenance is performed by lifting the sign open from the front. Most smaller VMS are of the <b>front</b> <b>access</b> form factor, and are typically installed today on major arterials. The rear access form factor {{is similar to the}} <b>front</b> <b>access</b> form factor, except that maintenance is performed {{from the rear of the}} sign, and are commonly used for medium-sized dynamic message signs installed along the roadside of freeways (instead of overhead). The walk-in form factor is a more recent introduction, where maintenance on the sign is performed from the inside of the sign. A key advantage of the walk-in form factor is that lane closures are generally not required to perform maintenance on the sign. Most of the largest VMS units installed today are walk-in units, and are typically installed overhead on freeways.|$|R
