40|$|In this study, an {{approach}} to predict and analyse the effects of moisture ingress on residual stresses in multi-stable composite laminates is developed. Residual stresses are a common consequence of the manufacturing process of composite laminates (e. g. formed thermally, following cool-down from manufacture). Imbalance in these stresses about the mid-plane can lead to warping, and so composite laminates are usually restricted to symmetrical lay-ups. In certain cases, unbalanced residual stresses can be used advantageously, such as in novel morphing structures by use of multi-stable parts. These are parts which feature two or more stable shape configurations, which are obtainable through a force application. With energy only being required to alternate between shapes, multi-stable laminates have been proposed as morphing aerodynamic surfaces for aerospace and wind-energy applications. In these cases (and others in which the laminates are sensitive to residual stresses such as thin plates, ply drop off and bonded repairs) {{a thorough understanding of}} the residual stresses (both as-manufactured and in-service) is required. The residual stresses in fibre-resin composites are known to be sensitive to environmental effects, which can be encountered under in-service conditions. One such effect is moisture absorption, which alters the residual stress state of a laminate through matrix swelling and plasticisation. These changes may lead to a change in the laminate’s shape, {{and in the case of}} multi-stable laminates, a change in the multi-stable behaviour. Applications based upon these unsymmetrical laminates therefore require consideration to moisture effects at a design stage. In this work, a combined numerical/experimental approach is presented whereby the macro-scale through-thickness residual stresses of dry and saturated unsymmetrical composite laminates can be predicted and analysed. A range of unsymmetrical laminates were manufactured from carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (unidirectional continuous fibres pre-impregnated in a polymer-resin matrix), featuring both square cross-ply and tailored (i. e. featuring local variations in lay-up and/or thickness – representative of laminates that would be used in complex applications) laminate configurations. Following manufacture, the <b>dry</b> <b>laminate</b> shapes were measured, with, in the case of the tailored laminates, laser scanning – a full-field, non-contact surface measuring technique. Three-dimensional continuum based finite element models were created (using the software Abaqus) to simulate the thermal deformation of the laminates. The models were benchmarked using analytical approaches, and subsequently calibrated to match the experimentally measured laminate shapes by means of equivalent orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients, negating the need to account for individual residual stress contributors. Subsequently, laminates were immersed in water until saturation, and the change in shape due to matrix swelling was measured. The numerical models were then adapted to take into account moisture induced matrix swelling by use of the analogy between thermal expansion and moisture induced swelling. Subsequently, the variation in shape and residual stress distribution in the laminates following moisture saturation could be analysed. Using laser scanning to measure the tailored laminate shapes allowed for a detailed analysis of the full-field variation between numerically-predicted and experimentally-measured laminate shapes. Using this analysis technique, macro-scale through-thickness residual stress profiles were extracted for each of the cross-ply and tailored laminate configurations. It was found that peak residual stresses can drop by over 70 % following moisture saturation resulting in a significant loss of curvature. Likewise, laminate potential energy can drop by over 90 %, impacting upon the laminates multi-stable behaviour...|$|E

40|$|The interlaminar {{stresses}} are {{confined to}} a region near the free edge. Therefore, the laminate stacking sequence and the free edge finishing {{are some of the}} factors that affect the strength of the laminate and limit its life. The use of molded edges eliminates the need for trimming and machining the laminates edges thus improving productivity. However, this fabrication technique may have a detrimental effect on the laminate strength for certain stacking sequences. This effect in the presence of moisture has not been characterized. This work presents the results of a comparative study of the resistance to delamination of laminates with machined edges and molded edges. Additionally, two environmental conditions were considered: <b>dry</b> <b>laminates</b> and laminates saturated with moisture. The tensile strength of the laminates were measured and micrographs were used to analyze the microstructure of the laminates near the free edges. It is concluded that the mechanical properties of advanced composites depend on the environmental conditions and the fabrication techniques used to produce the laminates.

Process heater is used in Baking, <b>Drying,</b> <b>Laminating,</b> Metal Working, Packaging, Plastic Welding, Preheating, Sealing, Soldering, Shrink Fitting, Synthetic Fabric Sewing and in other industries. But heating of air to a very high heat flux is sometimes impossible without the degradation of air quality, because many industries use combustion of gases for the purpose of heating the air to a very high heat flux. Electric heater can be alternative heating equipment, but it requires costly and long heating apparatus for the desired air temperature. In the present study, heat transfer enhancement in an air process heater was investigated both numerically and experimentally. A circular duct with 5 semi-circular hollow baffles and 4 cartridge electric heaters was designed for the process heating. Air was supplied from a wind tunnel at 3. 17 × 104 Reynolds number. Total supplied electric power was 3 kW. The results showed the temperature ratio (Ambient Temperature/Air Temperature) to be decreased up to 0. 72 where in many electric air heaters the temperature ratio is about 0. 9. The designed air process heater supplies air at velocity 19 m/s and temperature up to 147 °C. The experimental results were also matched with the numerical simulation values of the designed heater.

This study concentrated on investigating and comparing the effect of laser fluence (0. 01 to 2 J/cm 2) and number of shots (1 to 1000) on the etch characteristics of the Laminar AX dry film on both substrates. The other important aspects that were studied include the minimum required seed layer thickness for electroplating.

The surface quality and roughness of the laser micromachined sites and their effect on the plated Nickel structures were studied in detail. The laser fluence and the number of shots used at this stage affected the conditions of the seed layer, which in turn influenced the plated film growth kinetics. The seed layers with thicknesses less than or equal to 0. 8 mm were completely removed when high fluence (> around 1 J/cm 2) was used.

The structures were made on both Cu (60 µm) clad PCB and on Cu/Ti (up to 4 µm/ 15 nm) sputtered Si (100) substrates. The substrates were laminated with Laminar AX dry film (35 µm) photopolymer, which was then patterned by laser ablation to produce the mould for Ni electroforming. The optimal ablation conditions were identified for laser patterning to prepare the micro polymer mould. Beam fluence (~ 1 J/cm 2) and number of shots (~ 60 pulses) for 50 µm wide features on this photoresist were established, and it was observed that an increased number of shots and increased fluence was needed for features less than 20 µm. Additionally, the Cu layer surface was cleaned by the use of 5 - 10 laser pulses at the same fluence. Ni electroforming has been carried out using standard Ni sulfamate bath at a current density of ~ 10 mA/cm 2. After Ni electroforming, both the Laminar AX dry film and the Cu layers around the electroformed Ni patterns were removed using a combination of acetone, laser and Cu selective etching.

Large-scale urban coal tarred areas contribute immensely to the heat island effect and to excessive carbon emissions. One of the strategies that can guarantee results, in short term, is introducing energy generating galleries that can transform urban districts into power generators. Urban centres have a great capacity to be converted into beneficial galleries that can generate electricity using renewable sources and house within them a micro-climatic atmosphere that encourages urban agriculture. The present study provides possible solutions and applications of this approach through parametric model design and its simulated computer sided analysis {{in order to produce}} results for power generation (energy- plus), and overall benefits of comfort of proposing Power Plant Greenhouse Solar Galleries. The Energy Gallery project aims at identifying the potential of a new strategic design for energy generation at a urban scale. By strategically locating energygenerating/reducing systems like modular pavilions, green houses, winter gardens, or public facilities in the city's open spaces, we could reduce dioxide emissions by lowering the energy consumption due to public events and activities that are held inside.

In recent decades, the water level of Lake Vanda has been rising, creating a “natural experiment” on development of mat communities on newly flooded substrates and the response of deeper mats to declining irradiance. Mats in recently flooded depths accumulate one lamina (~ 0. 3 mm) per year and accrue ~ 0. 18 µg chlorophyll-a cm− 2 y− 1. As they increase in thickness, vertical zonation becomes evident, with the upper 2 - 4 laminae forming an orange-brown zone, rich in myxoxanthophyll and dominated by intertwined Leptolyngbya trichomes. Below this, up to six phycobilin-rich green/pink-pigmented laminae form a subsurface zone, inhabited by Leptolyngbya, Oscillatoria and Phormidium morphotypes.

40|$|Carbon fibre textile {{semi-finished}} products are playing {{an important role}} {{for the production of}} carbon fibre reinforced plastics via (liquid) resin infusion processes, e. g. in aircraft manufacturing and other industrial applications. The focus of the present work is on multiaxial warp knitted fabrics, also called non-crimp fabrics (NCF), a form of textile with the reinforcement fibres placed in multiple (mostly 2 - 4) layers upon each other, held together by a knitting yarn pattern. An assessment methodology is presented, comprising seven test methods, of which there are four on the processability of the NCF-textiles in part manufacturing and three to characterize the textile quality aspects related to laminate mechanical properties. For each of these test methods, approaches are explained to derive quantifiable values from the results to make the textile characteristics of different materials comparable. With regard to processability, the deformation or drape behaviour of the multiaxial fabrics and the alteration in textile quality by such processes are predominantly addressed. For this purpose, a test method for bulk and compaction characteristics is described as well as two test methods to characterize the in-plane (shear) deformation behaviour, one for biaxial and another for tri- and quadraxial warp-knitted fabrics. From the application of the test methods, results on the identification of the ply structure and textile production parameters governing this deformation behaviour are also presented. The area of processability is completed with a simple test on the infuseablity of the NCF with resin. For assessment of textile quality, methods to quantify the fibre angle deviations, both in and perpendicular to the textile plane are presented, as well as a method to assess the influences of the knitting yarn induced ply distortions. All tests can already be performed on the <b>dry</b> textile, before <b>laminate</b> specimen manufacturing and preparation. Concerning the laminate mechanical properties, examinations are made as to how the different structures of the dry textile are transferred into laminate structures. Furthermore, different approaches or theoretical models are applied to evaluate their influence on the compression strength of those laminates. The derived results are compared to real compression test data. The methods presented in this work enable to obtain a better comprehension of the correlations in NCF textiles and composites manufactured thereof. Thus, they allow a more structured and objective assessment of new NCF {{semi-finished products}} and the identification of weak points early in the selection process, to make a more precise and efficient material development possible. Furthermore, the methods can be used to ensure stable material properties in serial production, for instance during incoming / outgoing inspections...|$|R
40|$|This work {{relates to}} the {{development}} of a method of preparing a filled phenolic resin, for use particularly, but not exclusively, in building materials. The method includes mixing filler and micro-filler, a catalyst, resin and a hetrocyclic alcohol (i. e. furfuryl alcohol) at a stable temperature, compacting the mixture and allowing the mixture to set and cure. The condition for setting may be with heat and pressure, with heat and/or pressure, or at ambient temperature and pressure. To design a particular grading from the various numbers of filler components available, a computer program was produced permitting up to 14 components of known grading to be combined into the closest possible approximation to a defined target grading. This was compared to the grading obtained using a combination of trial and error and graphical procedures. In developing the Phenolic Concrete mixes, initially, the cold set resol phenolic systems were used which resulted in products with low strength as a result of insufficient bond development between the inert granular or powder like materials (fillers) and the resin. Consequently, modified resins were developed which resulted in the production of high strength Phenolic Concrete systems. The determination of the Phenolic Concrete properties was used in describing the indicative inter-relation between the mix constituents, mix proportioning, and criteria of both strength and economy. In addition, Phenolic Concrete mixes were designed with optimization of the mix matrix resin in developing highly fillable media and defining its macro- properties affecting the strength of the end product. Its material properties as a function of its microstructure was investigated using fracture mechanics. The maximum mix ratio devised was 9 : 1 weight by weight of filler to resin. Maximum compressive cylinder strength obtained was 88. 3 N/mrn(^ 2) and maximum disc tensile strength was 8. 85 N/mm(^ 2) with maximum flexural strength being 30. 5 N/mm(^ 2). The unit weights ranged from 2. 08 to 2. 28 g/cm(^ 3), modulus of elasticity ranged from 14. 64 X 10 (^ 9) to 19. 6 X 10 (^ 9) N/m(^ 2) and flexural modulus ranged from 17. 4 x 10 (^ 9) to 32. 4 X 10 (^ 9) N/m(^ 2). Maximum fracture toughness obtained was 2. 12 N/m(^ 3 / 2), and maximum fracture energy was 220. 7 J/m(^ 2).
