40|$|AbstractThis {{study conducts}} {{experiments}} {{to determine the}} modes of communication {{that are able to}} produce and sustain collusion and how the efficacy of communication depends on market structure. Two communication treatments are considered: non-binding price announcements and unrestricted written communication. We find that price announcements are conducive to coordinating on a high price but only under duopoly and when <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> symmetric. The standard experimental finding that collusion without communication is rare when there are more than two <b>firms</b> <b>is</b> shown to be robust to allowing firms to make price announcements. When <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> asymmetric, price announcements do result in higher prices but {{there is little evidence that}} <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> coordinating their behavior. When <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> allowed to engage in unrestricted written communication, coordination on high prices occurs for all market structures.
