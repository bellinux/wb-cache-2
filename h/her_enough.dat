5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was about halfway down the slipway and twisted <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E
5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien wreckage. Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with the wreckage and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that the wreckage belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute and her work earned <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations of dataDyne, setting the stage for the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
5|$|Nancy {{then starts}} {{to think that}} Darren and Sienna are having an affair, and sleeps with Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) and his father Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener). Things are {{eventually}} sorted between Darren and Nancy, however as their wedding gets closer, they start to argue again as Nancy believes that Darren is not taking the wedding seriously. Nancy sleeps with Rick again although the next morning she has regrets. On the night of her hen do, Nancy is attacked by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) following an argument, and he attempts to rape her while wearing a mask. However, she is saved by Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), and Darren and Nancy get remarried anyway. Finn is arrested and Darren stands by Nancy in court, however due to the DNA tests, Nancy is forced to admit her affair and that she slept with Rick within 24 hours before the attack. This creates more strife between Darren and Nancy; Darren sleeps with Sienna. Darren cannot forgive Nancy for her affair, they realise that married life has not been right {{for a long time}} and they agree to get divorced again. Darren offers to buy Nancy's half of The Dog In The Pond Pub in order to give <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> money to restart her life. The deed of transfer for The Dog has been signed and Darren is now the sole owner of The Dog In The Pond.|$|E

After engaging in an exchange of fire with police, McLendon committed suicide, bringing {{the total number of}} dead to eleven in the related incidents.

McLendon was said to have been depressed about lack of work; in a note he said that his mother's family was not giving <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> support.|$|E
25|$|Jack Lowe Sr.’s father, John Burford Lowe, was a {{traveling}} insurance salesman who often left his wife, Florence, and their infant son behind while travelling. In 1913 or 1914, J.B. Lowe left {{his wife and}} baby in New Orleans. Needing money, Mrs. Florence Lowe spoke to {{the owner of a}} grocery store and he agreed to give <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> money for milk and food in exchange for her working at his store. However, she later fell too sick to work and earn money. The grocer got in touch with Mrs. Lowe’s mother who moved Mrs. Lowe and baby to Farmerville, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Hantuchová also {{reached the}} quarterfinal in Leipzig {{and the final}} in Filderstadt, losing to Kim Clijsters, 4–6, 6–3, 4–6. The second set was the only set Hantuchová had taken from Clijsters in their nine meetings. She {{then went on to}} reach the quarterfinals of Zurich, losing to {{eventual}} champion Patty Schnyder in three tight sets, and the semifinals in Linz, and winning both of her singles rubbers in the Fed Cup final. This impressive season amassed <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> points to compete at the prestigious annual Tour Championships, losing in the first round to 17th ranked Magdalena Maleeva, 2–6, 5–7. Hantuchová's record for the year was 56–25 and 6–10 against top-10 players; 6–2 in singles Fed Cup play; 10–6 on indoor carpet, 6–2 on grass, 11–7 on clay, and 29–10 on hard courts.|$|E

500|$|Her {{frequent}} European {{tours in}} the 1990s maintained her visibility {{in the eyes}} of the fans and granted <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> income to survive the bleak period. She became so popular in Spain that she was voted for 13 times Best International Singer by the readers of the music magazine Heavy Rock in their annual polls. She often declared to live and tour for the fans and said that she [...] "would never cancel a tour and everybody knows that about me". Lemmy, in a 2003 interview, testified how nice and professional Doro is.|$|E
500|$|Rayder {{made her}} Paris runway debut on the 1997 fall runway for {{designers}} like Chanel, Christian Lacroix, and Dries van Noten. In 1998, {{she was in}} high demand and her booking prices were sometimes bid up to $25,000 by clients hoping to pay <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to cancel other appearances. [...] In 1999, she became the face of Givenchy and Meisel photographed her for Dolce & Gabbana and Versace ad campaigns. [...] In the fall of 2000, The New York Times referred to her and her sister collectively as the famous Rayder Sisters. [...] At the same time, it also described Frankie as an it girl.|$|E
500|$|Hathaway, by contrast, {{actively}} {{sought the}} part, tracing [...] "Hire me" [...] {{in the sand}} of the zen garden on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to not require her to audition, {{she knew she was}} not the studio's first choice and had to be patient (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. She celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part.|$|E

500|$|Less {{than three}} months after Jutland, Westfalen was torpedoed by the British {{submarine}} [...] on 19 August 1916, but suffered minimal damage and was soon repaired. In 1918, Westfalen and Rheinland were detached from the High Seas Fleet and ordered into the Baltic Sea. Finland was revolting against Russian rule, and the two ships were to aid the Finns in the civil war. On 11 April at approximately 07:30, Rheinland ran aground off the Åland Islands. Approximately 6,000 tons of guns, belt armor, and coal were removed in order to lighten <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to be refloated, which was not accomplished until 9 July. Rheinland was never repaired, and instead saw the remainder of her service as a barracks ship in Kiel.|$|E
500|$|Several {{weeks after}} all the major parts had been cast, the actors {{gathered}} in New York for a table read. Hathaway was nervous and goofy, she recalls, since she still had not developed her idea of the part; she described her performance at that point as [...] " [...] particularly impressive." [...] Blunt, by contrast, found Streep's laugh relaxed <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to keep her focused on playing a nervous, distracted Emily. The highlight of the session was Streep's first line as Miranda. Instead of the [...] "strident, bossy, barking voice" [...] everyone expected, Hathaway says, Streep silenced the room by speaking in a near whisper. [...] "It was so unexpected and brilliant." [...] At the reading Streep also changed Miranda's last line to [...] "everybody wants to be us" [...] from the original [...] "me".|$|E
500|$|Ships {{designed}} for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or [...] and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, {{was the first}} large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> range to cross the Atlantic, {{she would have had}} little endurance {{on the other side of}} the ocean. The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.|$|E

500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She {{had no idea what the}} hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E
500|$|In September 1973, Crawford {{moved from}} {{apartment}} 22-G {{to a smaller}} apartment next door (22-H) at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a party honoring her old friend Rosalind Russell at New York's Rainbow Room. Russell was suffering from breast cancer and arthritis at the time. When Crawford saw the unflattering photos {{that appeared in the}} papers the next day, she said, [...] "If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore." [...] Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews and left her apartment less and less. Dental-related issues, including surgery which left her needing round-the-clock nursing care, plagued her from 1972 until mid-1975. While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to pass out, slip and strike her face. The incident scared <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to give up drinking, although she insisted that it was because of her return to Christian Science. The incident is recorded in a series of letters sent to her insurance company held in the stack files on the 3rd floor of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; it is also documented by Carl Johnnes in his biography of the actress, Joan Crawford: The Last Years.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the major}} film studios {{approached}} Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A {{lot of people want to}} see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable." [...] Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary music critics {{received}} the [...] "Ave Maria" [...] with mixed reception. While some praised Knowles' emotion-filled vocals, others stated that her version {{as merely a}} normal take on the original. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commended the open-hearted emotion and the soft vocals that Knowles adopts on [...] "Ave Maria", before adding that it is [...] "a clever riff on the classic aria" [...] and [...] "a unique risk that pays off". Likewise, the Hartford Courants Eric R. Danton, praised the rework of the classic aria, adding that Knowles' lyrics were an [...] "elegant take on the timeless melody". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that Knowles twist on the song is [...] "vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional." [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly wrote that on the I Am disc there were some [...] "lovely ballads" [...] including [...] "Disappear", the [...] "soaring 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria'". Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "Beyoncé has a real flair for grandeur" [...] and the [...] "big, wide melodies of 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria' give <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> to work with that." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] offers a [...] "rare moment of comfort" [...] and added that it [...] "come off as delicate as [...] emotions." [...] Jim Farber of Daily News praised the song with its [...] "operatic flourishes... heavenly élan". In another review, {{he noted that the}} song was [...] "by far her most melodically sure, and musically diverse, work". USA Todays Elysa Gardner chose [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as one of the songs to download from the album. While reviewing I Am... Sasha Fierce, a critic from People magazine noted that [...] "the classically tinged 'Ave Maria,'... shows even more range [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{order of}} the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the {{sequence}} as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire, while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson. The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with jaundice at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same modus operandi they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise. Simpson was a pensioner {{who lived in the}} nearby village of Gilmerton and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828—the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession—she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox. They received £10 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that [...] "Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh... but [...] did not ask any questions". In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave <b>her</b> <b>enough</b> whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another £10.|$|E
