40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of advanced components for the future wideband side band separating and / or multipixel receivers for radio-astronomy with ultimate sensitivity. In this thesis, a novel frequency multiplier based on distributed superconducting tunnel (SIS) junctions has been demonstrated for the first time, taking advantage of the extreme inherent nonlinearity of such device. This practical demonstration is the result of an extensive theoretical exploration and modelling, showing the importance of the reactive quasi-particle tunnel current {{and its impact on the}} SIS tunnel junction frequency multiplier. In addition, a novel technique was suggested that allows for the first time direct measurement of the reactive quasi-particle tunnel current. This work comprehends the analysis, design and characterisation of the first frequency multiplier using distributed SIS junctions. The measured output power generated by the distributed SIS junction at the second harmonic of the input frequency were in good agreement with the model. Furthermore, the distributed SIS junction as a frequency multiplier were for the first time able to pump an SIS mixer. An efficiency of the distributed SIS <b>junction</b> <b>multiplier</b> of 15 - 30 % for a fractional bandwidth of 10 % with excellent spectral line purity were demonstrated. The - 3 dB line width of the multiplied signal is better than 1 Hz, which were the lowest resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyser. Consequently, the results attained in this work show that the distributed SIS junction frequency multiplier has considerable future potential, and could possibly be used in LO source in single-ended and multi-pixel SIS mixer layouts. Furthermore, in order to improve the sideband rejection ratio of cryogenically cooled sideband separating receivers for radio astronomy receivers to more than 15 dB over a wide RF and IF bandwidth, novel wideband RF and IF hybrid couplers have been developed and demonstrated with very low imbalances. More specifically, a 4 - 8 GHz IF assembly comprising a compact 90 ° hybrid chip, two bias-T circuits and two transmission line circuits was designed and characterised. The compact size of the hybrid chip allows it to be integrated into virtually any sideband separating (2 SB) mixer operating at cryogenic temperatures and is furthermore especially advantageous for multi-pixel 2 SB receivers or low noise balanced amplifier layouts. The characterisation of the hybrid assembly was performed at a cryogenic temperature of 4 K and sophisticated calibration and fixture de-embedding procedures were used. To further improve the sideband rejection ratio, a novel design for a RF 90 ° waveguide hybrid with very low amplitude imbalance over a fractional bandwidth of 30 % (159 - 216 GHz) was demonstrated. Both Hybrids are currently implemented in the ALMA Band 5 receivers, which represent the state-of-the-art for ultra-low noise sideband separated receivers. In order to allow complete characterisation of the ALMA Band 5 cartridge a highly versatile measurement setup has been built. The measurement setup includes all necessary hardware and achieves automatic measurements for the system noise and sideband rejection with in-built optimisation procedures. The measurement setup additionally comprises measurements of the receiver saturation, phase and amplitude stability, as well as optical beam characterisation...|$|E

40|$|Time-dependent {{analysis}} of the quantum mechanical wavefunction has been performed {{on a variety of}} quantum interference transistor (QUIT) structures, and it has been found that reflections at non-adiabatic or quasi-adiabatic junctions can severely effect the evolution between constructive and destructive interference. This multiple reflections effect is neglected in analytical models, but will be accounted for, in the present work, via a time-dependent propagator method that can be applied to an arbitrary device geometry. Furthermore, the analyzed structures will be assessed in terms of switching speed via Fourier Transformation of the Wavefunction response to an applied bias pulse. Simulations indicate that switching speeds of up to 15 THz, at 4. 2 K, can be achieved by some of the analyzed structures. ^ Constantly advancing semiconductor fabrication methods have made it possible to construct devices with dimensions so small (mesoscopic) that the quantum mechanical nature of the electron can no longer be neglected in transport calculations. These quantum effect devices include resonant tunneling devices (RTD 2 ̆ 7 s), single electron transistors (SET 2 ̆ 7 s), and quantum interference transistors (QUIT 2 ̆ 7 s), which are the focus of this work. QUIT 2 ̆ 7 s rely on the phase coherence of electrons, which undergo ballistic (reduced scattering) rather than ohmic transport, on these size scales. ^ Techniques, present in the literature, for modeling transport in the ballistic regime of semiconductors, include Green Functions, Wigner Functions, Transfer Matrix, and propagator methods. Most are time-independent and provide only steady-state analysis. Green and Wigner function approaches also tend to be cumbersome when non-idealized device geometries are examined. Although the Transfer Matrix technique can handle complex geometries, it cannot handle multiply connected regions. Time-independent propagator methods can handle multiply connected regions but are inaccurate for nonadiabatic junctions. Consequently, the method used in the present work is a time-dependent beam propagation method with monoenergetic transparent boundary conditions. It can accommodate both adiabatic and nonadiabatic <b>junctions,</b> <b>multiply</b> connected regions, and yield both transient and steady-state analysis. This technique generates the single electron wavefunction, in the effective mass approximation, for the x (lateral) and z (propagation) directions and time. Additionally, it is possible to incorporate a self-consistent calculation, at thermal equilibrium, of the y (transverse) direction, which would yield a quasi four-dimensional approach for modeling mesoscopic devices. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the analysis, design, and {{characterization}} of the first frequency multiplier using distributed superconductor–insulator–superconductor (SIS) junctions. We derived analytical expressions describing {{the properties of the}} distributed SIS junction as a frequency multiplier. The modeling of the distributed SIS junctions shows that high conversion efficiency can be achieved when used as the multiplier. The measured output power generated by such multiplier employing the distributed SIS junction at the second harmonic of the input frequency is in good agreement with the model. Furthermore, the frequency multiplier based on the distributed SIS junction for the first time was able to pump an SIS mixer. The multiplication efficiency of the distributed SIS junction is 15 – 30 % for a fractional bandwidth of 10 % with excellent spectral line purity. The – 3 dB line width of the multiplied signal is 1 Hz, which was limited by the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} myosin heavy chain isoforms in each extraocular muscle (EOM) fiber type. METHODS. Serial sections of adult rat EOMs were stained with isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies against an array of myosin heavy chains. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of whole adult rat EOMs, examined by confocal microscopy, demonstrated the longitudinal variations of isoforms along individual fibers. RESULTS. Each global fiber type reacted predominantly with a single isoform-specific antibody and showed no longitudinal variation. Two major orbital fibers were defined, and both contained multiple myosin heavy chains. Both orbital singly and multiply innervated fibers stained proximal and distal to the neuromuscular junction with antibody to embryonic myosin heavy chain, but this isoform was sharply and completely excluded from {{the domain of the}} neuromuscular junction. Orbital singly innervated fibers also contained the EOM-specific isoform at the neuromuscular <b>junction.</b> Orbital <b>multiply</b> innervated fibers did not contain the EOM-specific isoform, but additionally contained a slow isoform along their entire length. CONCLUSIONS. Adult rat EOMs show unique fiber types with arrangements of myosin heavy chain isoforms not seen in other skeletal muscles. Moreover, unique cellular mechanisms must exist to target each isoform to its proper domain along individual orbital fibers. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci...|$|R
