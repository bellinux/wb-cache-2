25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
25|$|De Faria says he {{was told}} by his spirit guides that he must expand his work to reach more people and spiritist medium Chico Xavier told him he {{should go to the}} small Goiás town of Abadiânia to fulfill his healing mission. Around 1978, when João first {{performed}} healings there, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> outdoors in a chair near the main road where people began to arrive seeking cures for their various illnesses and conditions. Gradually the numbers increased to thousands per day and he developed his centre, Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola. The Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola has since been visited by millions of people seeking healing. He also owns a nearby cattle ranch, which covers about 1,000 acres and is valued over 2 million reais.|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E

60|$|Wiping away several {{glittering}} beads {{from his}} beard, old Mohi turning round where <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>just</b> outside the canopy, solemnly affirmed, that the drinking of that water had cured many {{a man of}} ambition.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy Choux started second {{favourite}} in the 2011 Cox Plate. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>just</b> off {{the pace}} and gained a clear lead around the final turn, before being run down late by Pinker Pinker to finish second. He then ran fourth as topweight in the Emirates Stakes, before closing his campaign with a sixth placing in the Hong Kong Mile.|$|R
2500|$|Lin's {{complaints}} {{got worse}} {{with time and}} age. In the years before his death, the fiancee of Lin's son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even {{to the extent that}} he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: [...] "usually <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, blankly". In Lin's rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues.|$|E
2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
50|$|Willing {{had decided}} that he must now return to his true métier and he rented a room in a disused school in Stepney, east London and began to paint. Alone for long periods, and {{standing}} only with difficulty, <b>he</b> often <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> {{and looked at the}} wall. During these periods of 'reverie' pictures would appear to him of an intense and visionary quality which he was then able to draw. Many of these drawings were subsequently enlarged into oil paintings and both were exhibited in 1978 at the AIR (Artist Information Registry) Gallery, then in Shaftesbury Avenue, central London. This exhibition was a critical success and during the next ten years was followed by several others most notably at the Serpentine Gallery (1982) and the Whitechapel Art Gallery (1986), the latter a major retrospective.|$|R
5000|$|Bill Elliott {{tied the}} modern-era record for {{successive}} victories at four (earning the nickname [...] "Mr. March"). This came 6 months after Harry Gant accomplished the same feat in September 1991. Bill Elliott continued to {{chip away at}} Davey Allison's lead by reducing it to 48 points. Harry Gant was also consistent {{in the early part}} of the season, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>just</b> 53 points behind Allison.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My delinquencies {{made very}} little {{impression}} on you, then,' said Anne; 'I went on very fluently {{with the story}} till just as I had pronounced the words, [...] "two-legged blackbirds," [...] I saw Uncle Woodbourne's eye upon me, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>just</b> opposite, with all its cold heavy sternness of expression, {{and at the same}} moment I heard a strange suppressed snort behind my chair.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Keith Morris was the {{photographer}} who took Drake's photo {{for the cover}} of Bryter Layter (1971) and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of Pink Moon. However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around {{the cover of the}} LP: [...] "I remember going to talk to , and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell me what he wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on." [...] Island picked a piece of surrealist Dali-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of Pink Moon, many close to him felt that he approved.|$|E
60|$|Further {{than that}} he would not say. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> upon the edge of the jeddak's couch and waited.|$|E
60|$|Old Mr. Toad didn't look troubled {{the least}} bit. He didn't even {{look around for}} a hiding-place. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> still and grinned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{replied the}} Lady, [...] "the house of Douglas have never broken their safe-conduct, and never will--too deeply did they suffer {{by such a}} breach of trust, {{exercised}} on themselves, when your Grace's ancestor, the second James, {{in defiance of the}} rights of hospitality, and of his own written assurance of safety, poniarded the brave Earl of Douglas with his own hand, and within two yards of the social board, at which <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> before <b>sat</b> the King of Scotland's honoured guest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Caitiff!' {{she cries}} to your butler;" [...] his majesty went on, [...] "'perjured knave, thou liest in thy throat! Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from here, and how sayest thou that thou slewest the monster, and camest hither {{in a few}} hours' space?' This had not {{occurred}} to me,--I am a plain king, but I at once saw the force of her majesty's argument. 'Yes,' said I; 'how did you manage it?' But he--your man, I mean--was not a bit put out. 'Why, your majesty,' says <b>he,</b> 'I <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down on that there bit of carpet, wished I was here, and here I ham. And I'd be glad, having had the trouble,--and my time not being my own,--to see the colour of them perkisits, according to the proclamation.' On this her majesty grew more indignant, if possible. 'Nonsense!' she cried; 'a story out of the Arabian Nights is not suited for a modern public, and fails to win aesthetic credence.' These were her very words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is a bad}} business," [...] {{the doctor}} went on, [...] "he {{told me that when}} he came back from hunting {{yesterday}} he went upstairs to change when suddenly the room seemed to go round. Fortunately <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down on a couch and taken off his top boots, and he fell sideways on to it. He says he was insensible for about half an hour; the first thing he was conscious of was the servant knocking at the door, to say that dinner was ready; he told the man that he did not feel well and should not go down; he got off his things and lay down for an hour and then felt well enough to write the note to me. Of course I made a thorough examination of him, and found that, as I feared, it was a bad case of heart disease, probably latent for a long time, but now I should say making rapid progress. Of course I told him something of the truth.|$|R
60|$|The cousin heated the bathroom, and the {{man went}} into it, but he neither washed nor rubbed himself, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there and waited.|$|E
60|$|But {{everybody}} took {{good care}} {{to keep away}} from Reddy Fox, everybody but Johnny Chuck. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> still and chuckled and chuckled till his fat sides shook.|$|E
60|$|Once more poor Mrs. Quack {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with her troubles and sorrows. Peter wished {{with all his}} heart {{that he could do}} something to comfort her, but of course he couldn't, so <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> still and waited until she could tell him just what did happen to Mr. Quack.|$|E
5000|$|Tourist {{started his}} three-year-old {{campaign}} with another loss, {{this time a}} fourth place finish at Aqueduct on January 10, 2014, again on the dirt. On February 8 at Gulfstream Park, he finally won {{for the first time}} in a maiden special weight race at [...] miles on the turf. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>just</b> off the early pace then inched his way to the lead, completing the race in a good time of 1:40.40. He followed this up with an allowance race win on June 8 at Belmont Park, winning in wire-to-wire fashion by over five lengths.|$|R
60|$|They {{had waited}} to see Leonard, in order that they might learn better how to find his house in the country; and now, {{when they came in}} upon him at nine o'clock, he welcomed them with all his {{friendly}} heart. He rose from the pile of morning's letters to which <b>he</b> had but <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down; <b>he</b> placed them the easiest chairs; he made a feint of its not being a busy hour with him, and would have had them look upon his office, which was still damp and odorous from the porter's broom, as a kind of down-town parlor; but after they had briefly accounted to his amazement for their appearance then and there, and Isabel had boasted of the original fashion in which they had that morning seen New York, they took pity on him, and bade him adieu till evening.|$|R
5000|$|According to Sharon Robinson, Cohen {{took the}} grainy {{photo on the}} album cover himself: [...] "We were <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> at Leonard's {{computer}} and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> took one of those webcam pictures with the basic camera that {{was attached to the}} computer," [...] she explained to Anthony Reynolds. [...] "Of course, he does everything with a lot of thought and care and I remember him composing the shot. But at the time I don't think he intended it as the album cover - <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> taking a picture." ...|$|R
60|$|Johnny {{thought he}} couldn't be {{surprised}} any more; {{but when he}} had mounted many stairs and {{found himself in a}} great room with a glass roof, full of rich curtains, strange armor, pretty things, and pictures everywhere, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> in the big chair where he was placed, and stared in silent delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good luck to your messes," [...] {{answered}} Tom, as {{he walked}} away meditatively crunching his cinnamon, and looking {{as if he did}} not find it as spicy as usual. He got his books, but did not read them; for, shutting himself up in the little room called [...] "Tom's den," [...] <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down and brooded.|$|E
6000|$|... "The ship’s {{course was}} altered, an’ after {{the old man}} was {{satisfied}} he went back to bed again, an’ almost directly arter eight bells went, an’ I was relieved. I wasn’t on deck when the fust mate come up, but those that were said he took it very calm. He didn’t say a word. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down on the poop, and blew his cheeks out.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the race, several of the 14 {{starters}} were fractious or unruly as it took the starter eleven minutes to get the field settled. Broomspun broke from post position 7 in a forward position and stalked the leaders from fourth passing the stands {{for the first time at}} Pimlico Race Course. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>just</b> off leader Leonard II's flank going down the backstretch in 47.4 for the first half mile. On the final turn, Broomspun worked his way around on the outside and burst down the lane to take the lead by just over a length. In the final strides, he was ridden out hard by jockey Frank Coltiletti to hold for the win by three quarters of a length over a hard-charging filly named Polly Ann.|$|R
60|$|The Doctor had <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down {{to dinner}} when Bathurst came in. The two subalterns were dining with him.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of applause. Docker pointed with {{threatening}} forefinger {{to the man}} who had <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
60|$|At last {{there came}} a day when he missed that cheery whistle. He waited and waited. At last he went clear {{to the edge of}} the Green Forest, but there was no whistle and no sign of Farmer Brown's boy. It was the same way the next day and the next. Happy Jack forgot to frisk about the way he usually does. He lost his appetite. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> around and moped.|$|E
60|$|Granny White {{was found}} dead in the Foxwell wagon. She was a fat and {{helpless}} old woman who never did anything but sit down all the time and smoke a pipe. She was the mother of Abby Foxwell. And Mrs. Grant had been killed. Her husband sat beside her body. He was very quiet. There were no tears in his eyes. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, his rifle across his knees, and everybody left him alone.|$|E
6000|$|During {{this moment}} {{he leaned back}} on the bench, meeting her in silence and with a face that grew more strange. It grew so strange that after a further instant she got {{straight}} up. She stood there as if their talk were now over, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> and watched her. It was as if now--owing to the third person they had brought in--they must be more careful; so that the most he could finally say was: [...] "That's where it is!" ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Davenant ran upstairs. Claire {{had succeeded}} in {{restoring}} her mother, who had <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> up when Captain Davenant entered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hear, hear, hear!' cries Lady Tippins. 'Your {{opinion of}} this MESALLIANCE, honourable colleagues of {{the honourable member}} who has <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> down?' ...|$|R
60|$|His musings were {{interrupted}} by a sweet feminine voice close by. Bridge did not open his eyes at once--he <b>just</b> <b>sat</b> there, listening.|$|R
