40|$|This thesis extends {{previous}} {{work that has}} been carried out in an air-water system in a gas-liquid ejector. The thesis presents the experimental programme undertaken and contains a survey of the available literature on the effects of liquid physical properties in gas-liquid ejector systems. The survey concentrates on the effects of coalescence inhibition and touches on viscosity effects. Due to the lack of research in such systems, the literature review was extended to look at the work carried out in stagnant fluids and in other systems such as stirred tank reactors and bubble columns. This was used to identify a fluid that would represent a non-coalescing system. The experimental work was split into three parts: the effect a) of flow parameters on gas holdup and bubble size in an air-water system; b) of coalescence inhibition and c) of liquid viscosity on ejector performance. Parameters measured in order to establish the ejector performance in the coalescence inhibited and viscous solutions were <b>gas</b> entrainment, <b>ejector</b> pumping efficiency, bubble size, gas holdup and mass transfer. A non-coalescing fluid was simulated using a 0. 08 M Magnesium Sulphate solution. It is believed, based on results reported by various researchers that this concentration was sufficient to achieve a near non-coalescing fluid. Various experiments were carried out and the above mentioned parameters measured to assess the ejector performance against a pure water system. Experimental results showed that coalescence inhibition has little effect on gas entrainment or gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). However, the Sauter mean diameter decreases with the non-coalescing nature and the bubbles were seen to be more spherical and appeared more rigid. Values of kLa are similar between coalescing and non-coalescing systems; this is due to an increase in a {{and at the same time}} a corresponding decrease in kL which may be due to a decrease in diffusivity. Newtonian CMC solution provided a viscous system over a range of viscosities (3 - 10 mPas). Comparisons were made with water (1 mPas) for the ejector performance parameters. Experimental results showed that viscosity has a small effect on <b>gas</b> entrainment and <b>ejector</b> pumping efficiency and little effect on gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). Sauter mean diameter was found to decrease with an increase in liquid viscosity, producing more spherical bubbles. Values of kLa were smaller for an increase in viscosity, despite an increase in a.

A novel method of nonionic surfactant based lipid vesicle (niosome) production coupling a <b>gas</b> <b>ejector</b> with the rapid expansion of a supercritical solution was studied. Niosomes were prepared using Tween 61, which was shown to be 4 - 6 % soluble (wt. basis) in SC-CO 2 ranging from 40 to 60 °C and 10 to 20 MPa, and cholesterol at a 1 : 1 molar ratio. Niosome lamellarity was shown to depend on the degree of precipitation of the lipid formulation at the point of aqueous cargo introduction. Niosome particle size distributions were bimodal, with the 80 - 99 % of the liposomal volume contributed niosomes ranging in size from 3 - 7 [mu]m and the remaining niosomes ranging from 239 - 969 nm, depending on the system configuration. Using the <b>gas</b> <b>ejector</b> for cargo introduction, the maximum encapsulation efficiency of a 0. 2 M sucrose solution was 28 %. Niosome size and encapsulation efficiency were shown to be influenced by aqueous cargo droplet formation and the aerodynamic forces of the expanding gaseous stream. Simultaneous encapsulation of ferrous sulphate and cholecalciferol achieved encapsulation efficiencies of 25. 1 ± 0. 2 % and 95. 9 ± 1. 5 %, respectively. Niosomes showed good physical stability at 20 °C, but storage at 4 °C showed an initial burst release of ferrous iron, indicating possible rupture of the niosomal membrane. Extraction of oil from potato chips was investigated as a means for the simultaneous production of low fat potato chips and flavor extract. Extraction conditions range 27. 6 - 41. 4 MPa, 35 - 80 °C and solvent flow rate of 0. 5 - 5. 0 g CO 2 /min.

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert <b>gas</b> or jet <b>ejector</b> systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector seal systems were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the seal system operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector seal systems have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil.

Firstly, the design, development, and construction of a test facility for a Honeywell APU-style centrifugal compressor was implemented, as well as the design and construction of an inlet flow experiment. Secondly, the aeromechanical response of an embedded stage in the Purdue 3 -Stage axial research compressor was analyzed through a suite of different measurement techniques in the fulfillment {{of the end of the}} GUIde IV Consortium contract. ^ The purpose of the first phase of Honeywell work was to comprehensively measure the flow field of an APU-style centrifugal compressor inlet through the use of Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). A portion of a Honeywell supplied inlet was modified to provide optical access to the elbow, and a <b>gas</b> <b>ejector</b> system was designed and constructed to provide the same suction to the inlet that it would see during operation with the compressor. A performance and health monitoring electronics system was designed and purchased to support the testing of the Honeywell inlet ejector system and eventually it will be used for testing with a centrifugal compressor. ^ Additionally, a secondary air and oil system has been designed and is currently being constructed in the test cell in preparation for the arrival of the Honeywell compressor this summer. ^ An embedded rotor stage in the Purdue 3 -stage compressor, with a Campbell diagram crossing of the 1 T vibratory mode was analyzed with a suite of measurement systems. In addition to steady state compressor performance measurements, other types of measurements were used to characterize the aerodynamic forcing function for this forced response condition including: NSMS, high-frequency pressure transducers mounted in the casing and in a downstream stator, and cross-film thermal anemometry. Rotor geometry was measured by Aerodyne using an in-situ laser scanning technique. Vibrometry testing was performed at WPAFB to characterize safe operating speeds for stator vibrations. ^ Several unsteady data processing techniques were developed to analyze the fast-response pressure and hot film data. Since it was unsafe to operate the compressor at R 2 resonance, slow sweeps through the resonance were utilized, thus complicating the data processing strategy. After significant analysis, there is evidence of the R 2 vibration in the fast-response pressure measurements using frequency and time-based analysis methods. Although not used in final data acquisition, the 3 D hotwire calibration facility and data processing techniques have been improved.

40|$|Operators {{of natural}} gas {{pipeline}} systems routinely reduce line pressure and discharge gas from pipeline sections to ensure safe working conditions during maintenance and repair activities. Typically, operators block the smallest possible linear section of the pipeline and depressurize it by venting gas to the atmosphere. In 2004, an estimated 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane was vented to the atmosphere during routine maintenance and pipeline upsets. Using pump-down techniques to lower gas line pressure before performing maintenance and repair activities is {{an effective way to}} reduce emissions and yield significant economic savings. Pipeline pump-down techniques involve using in-line compressors either alone or in sequence with portable compressors. Using in-line compressors is almost always justifiable because there are no capital costs, and payback is immediate. The cost-effectiveness of also using a portable compressor to increase gas recovery, however, depends greatly on site-specific factors and operating costs. Another alternative is to install an ejector. An ejector is a venturi nozzle that uses high-pressure gas as motive fluid to draw suction on a lower pressure gas source, discharging into an intermediate pressure <b>gas</b> stream. The <b>ejector</b> can be installed on vent connections up and down stream of a partly closed valve, or between the discharge and suction of a compressor which creates the necessary pressure differential. Regardless of the pump-down technique selected, emission reductions are directly proportional to how much pipeline pressure is reduced before venting occurs. On average, up to 90 percent of the gas in the pipeline can be recovered for sale instead of being emitted. Pipeline pump-down techniques are most economical for larger volume, higher pressure gas lines and work most effectively for planned maintenance activities and cases in which sufficient manifolding exists to connect a portable compressor.

NASA has recognized ejectors as {{a viable alternative to}} mechanical pumps for use in spacecraft fuel cell power systems.

Specifically, a custom pressure regulator has been developed that includes: (1) an ejector reactant circulation pump (with interchangeable jet nozzles and mixer sections, gas-tight sliding and static seals in required locations, and internal fluid porting for pressure-sensing at the regulator's control elements) and (2) internal fluid porting to allow for flow rate and system pressure measurements.

Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{processes}} for textile production {{are one of}} the largest water consuming and polluting sources. Quite usually, {{at the end of the}} dyeing process, a noticeable amount of dyes remains in wastewater as is not absorbed by fibres, leading to wastewater colouration. Dyes show resistance to degradation in the environment, since their peculiarity is chemical stability. Besides visual problems, the effect of residual dyes is negative on aquatic life because they inhibit sunlight transmission and may enter in the food chain. Generally, conventional biological treatment alone cannot guarantee adequate characteristics to treated water to allow the discharge into the environment or reuse in other processes. Specifically, a high salt content and residual colour are still present in the treated water after secondary treatments. Salt content can be remove using membrane filtration equipment instead the most profitable operation to remove colour appears oxidation. Other techniques, such as coagulation-flocculation, adsorption, membrane filtration, activated sludge, were studied to remove colour but land filling or incineration must be considered as final process. On the contrary, oxidation steps demolish the contaminant at molecular scale, even though not necessary the oxidation is complete. Generally ozone, being an oxidant agent, has a high oxidation potential (even at a low concentration), high efficiency in decomposition of organic matter, adds oxygen to water and has process low sensitivity to changes in temperature. Ozone is able to break up the conjugated bonds of organic matter thanks to a direct reaction between ozone and the organic compound or indirectly through the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The degradation of dyes with O 3 is a typical two phase reaction where an effective transfer of ozone from gas to liquid is a critical point. On the other hand, the kinetics of decolouration is usually fast. Therefore, the mass transfer is the rate limiting step. To achieve the best mass transfer condition, several gas diffusers and gas-liquid contactors have been proposed in literature such as turbines, <b>ejectors,</b> <b>gas</b> diffusers (sintered glass diffuser), etc. An innovative operative procedure took into account in this work was cavitation: it was considered as the mean to increase mass transfer of ozone in liquid medium. For this reason, an experimental equipment (Multi-task reactor) was designed and built (Fig. 1). Two types of cavitation were considered: hydrodynamic cavitation by ejector and ultrasound cavitation. The two types of cavitations were used separately or simultaneously in order to clean wastewater from different dyes typology (namely acid, cationic, reactive and disperse dyes). In addition, hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation was used to work alone to decolourise wastewater. Cavitations are able to produce free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, which can be used to attack dye cromophores groups of dye molecule. A bubble column reactor was built to compare the decolourisation results obtained in the Multi-task reactor. Bubble column was used as benchmark because represent the most common technology in wastewater decolouration. First of all, decolouration experiments were performed in the multi-task equipment in liquid batch conditions. After that, continuous tests were carried out and the results were compared with bubble column equipment decolouration experiments at the same operational conditions (liquid residence time, gas flow rate, ozone dose, dyestuffs and its concentration). Taking into account the final experiment results, only ultrasound cavitation was able to improve decolouration degree in the case of disperse dye. Comparing the experimental decolouration results obtained with the mentioned technologies, bubble reactor seem to be the best technology for oxidizing treatment. Moreover, fluid dynamic study was performed to bubble column reactor in order to stud...|$|R
