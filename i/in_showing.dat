5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk}} of seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

50|$|Tracey Witch of Ware, was {{a female}} English Cocker Spaniel who won the title of Best <b>In</b> <b>Show</b> at Cruft's <b>in</b> both 1948 and 1950. She missed out on the Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> judging <b>in</b> 1952 because of a delay in breed judging, and also became Reserve Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> 1953. She was a descendent of a {{previous}} Cruft's Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> winner, Luckystar of Ware.|$|R
5000|$|At The Kennel Club {{national}} <b>show</b> <b>in</b> 1939, she defeated fellow [...] "of Ware" [...] dog Sir Galahad of Ware for {{the title}} of Best of Breed, before going on to take the Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> title. [...] She went on to win Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> at Cruft's for the second time, becoming the second dog of Lloyds' to do so. Ch.

Also in 1939, she was Reserve Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> at the Cocker Spaniel Club of Ireland's championship show.|$|R
5|$|Free-speech advocates {{condemned}} {{the seizure of}} the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington {{and should have been}} taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the Richard J. Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> a racially insensitive image.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. <b>In</b> <b>showing,</b> a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{links to}} The Original Series {{were seen as}} {{positive}} improvements to Star Trek: Enterprise by critics including elements such as {{the appearance of the}} Mirror Universe and the Orion slave girls. Other story arcs praised included the Augment arc with Brent Spiner and the return of the genetic supermen made famous by Ricardo Montalbán's Khan in The Original Series. Phillip Chung of AsianWeek bemoaned the loss of the show, because he felt that it had improved over time and due to the franchise's continued progressive stance <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> racial minorities outside of the normal stereotypes.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{the breed}} has been {{successful}} at Crufts and secured the award of best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> <b>in</b> 1964, 1977 and 1988. At the Westminster <b>show</b> <b>in</b> America an English Setter won the best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> title <b>in</b> 1938. He was only 11 months old and at his very first show. This was before entry to the show was restricted to Champions in 1992. As of 2013, {{he is the only}} setter to achieve best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> at Westminster since the award of best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> started to be made in 1907.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Brett {{became the}} first Flat-Coated Retriever to win Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> at Crufts. Reserve Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> went to the {{previous}} year's winner, the Kerry Blue Terrier Ch. Callaghan of Leander. He was the most successful showdog of his breed in his era, and became a successful sire. His descendants include 2011 Crufts Best <b>in</b> <b>Show,</b> Sh Ch. Vbos The Kentuckian, and was the last Flat-Coated Retriever to win a Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> a multi-breed <b>show</b> until The Kentuckian at the East of England <b>show</b> <b>in</b> 2009.|$|R
50|$|Setters {{have been}} best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> at Crufts seven times. The award was secured by Irish setters in 1981, 1993, 1995 and 1999.

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, {{a teenage}} refugee and admirer of John Connor and the Resistance. As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, {{he was sent}} {{back in time to}} 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the {{survival}} of the human race, and fathered John with her. Yelchin said he wanted to portray Kyle as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker because it was a younger version of the character. The difference in his portrayal lies <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> Kyle as intense, but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper. Yelchin tried to convey Kyle's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.|$|E
50|$|Bright Beauty was not {{a popular}} pick for best <b>in</b> <b>show.</b> Most thought that best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> would be awarded to Haymarket Faultless.

25|$|A {{dog that}} completes a {{championship}} (called a finished champion) {{may continue to}} be entered <b>in</b> <b>shows</b> to compete for Group (winner of its group) or Best <b>In</b> <b>Show</b> (BIS) honors. A finished dog that continues to compete is called a special. Owners of Best <b>in</b> <b>Show</b> winners may add BIS or Multi BIS (multiple best <b>in</b> <b>show</b> winners) to their dog's name, as in the Siberian Husky Multi BIS/Ch Phoebe Run To Phoebus. Many prestigious shows only accept entries from dogs that have finished their championships.|$|R
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|Much of this wealth {{was spent}} by Henry on {{maintaining}} his court and household, including {{many of the}} building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland hung just 200. Henry took pride <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 handguns. Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government {{out of their own}} income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage, granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around £100,000), but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.|$|E
5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company had an interest <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused. In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E

5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest <b>in</b> <b>showing</b> empathy towards them.|$|E
