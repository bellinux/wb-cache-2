5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade,</b> and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{investigation}} was Avon Barksdale's drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale (Wood Harris) was aided by business-minded Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Avon's nephew D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) ran some of his uncle's territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience, while loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were Poot (Tray Chaney), Bodie (J. D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level drug dealers. Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade,</b> and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead. Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), a renowned Baltimore stick-up man robbing drug dealers for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan.|$|E
5|$|Seeking information, Ken points Tommy towards Juan Garcia Cortez (Robert Davi), {{who helped}} set the {{exchange}} up. Expressing regret for the matter, Cortez promises to help Tommy {{find out who}} masterminded the ambush plot. In the process of finding leads, Tommy meets Kent Paul (Danny Dyer), who leads Tommy {{to one of the}} participants in the ambush. Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz (Luis Guzmán), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the ambush. With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in the ambush, Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and distance himself from the Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade.</b> Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012, Venezuela's National Assembly removed Supreme Court Justice Eladio Aponte Aponte {{from his}} post after an {{investigation}} revealed alleged ties to drug-trafficking.

Aponte says that, while serving as a judge, he was forced to acquit an army commander who had connections with a 2 metric ton shipment of cocaine. Aponte also claimed that Henry Rangel, former defense minister of Venezuela, and General Clíver Alcalá Cordones were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} several {{recurring}} {{characters in the}} Barksdale Organization. Loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were Poot Carr (Tray Chaney), Bodie Broadus (J.D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level drug dealers. Wallace was an intelligent but naïve youth trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade,</b> Bodie a violent and determined young dealer, and Poot a lascivious young man happy to follow rather than lead.

25|$|Simpson, who has {{consistently}} professed his innocence in the Brown and Goldman killings, {{was acquitted of}} the murder charges almost a month after Nigg's death.

Nigg and Goldman, it has also been noted, were not the only waiters at Mezzaluna to be the victims of criminal activity during the mid-1990s.|$|E

25|$|Gilani {{managed to}} beat his {{addiction}} to heroin, {{but was still}} involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade.</b> In early 1997, Gilani was arrested with another man in a DEA sting operation {{when he tried to}} smuggle heroin into the country from Pakistan. Gilani quickly offered his services as a confidential informant to the DEA. In January 1998, the agency sent him to Pakistan to dispel suspicions amongst his partners about his prior absence, and to gain intelligence on the country's heroin trafficking networks. According to the DEA, Gilani's participation led to five arrests and the seizure of 2½ kilos of heroin. The DEA has insisted that Gilani's 1998 trip to Pakistan was the only one paid for by the agency.|$|E
25|$|Inzunza Inzunza {{was born}} in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico on 17 August 1971.

Born into a middle-class family, Inzunza Inzunza attended grade and middle school at Colegio Sinaloa, a religious institution.

Despite Escobar's numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband, though she urged him to eschew violence. Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with Pablo for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave. This attitude {{proved to be the}} reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after Pablo's death, although the group demanded (and received) millions of dollars in reparations for Escobar's war against them.

25|$|While no {{motive was}} {{established}} at trial, prosecutors and police believe Kimberlin {{went on the}} bombing spree to deflect attention away from an ongoing investigation {{of the murder of}} 65-year-old Julia Scyphers. Scyphers “violently disapproved” of her daughter Sandra Barton’s relationship with Kimberlin as well as the “strange affection” Kimberlin paid to Barton’s pre-teen daughter who had accompanied Kimberlin on several long unsupervised out-of-state trips. Scyphers arranged for her daughter and granddaughter to stay with her and on July 29, 1978 she was shot to death just outside her home. Her husband Fred Scyphers, who briefly saw the shooter, identified William Bowman as the man who shot his wife. Bowman was a close associate of Kimberlin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade</b> but Fred Scyphers died shortly after the murder and Bowman was never charged, as the prosecution’s only witness died. Her murder still remains unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Children {{are also}} used in drug trades in all regions of the world. Specifically, {{children}} are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they become addicted and further entrapped. Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance. While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the I.L.O has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement in the drug trades of Brazil. Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>trade</b> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.|$|E
