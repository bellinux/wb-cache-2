40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} with {{crude oil}} and its derivates {{has become a}} growing problem due to their toxic and carcinogenic effects on live organisms. Proper collection and treatment of oily wastewaters {{is very important for}} prevention and disabling of harmful effects on the environment. The most important step in the oily wastewater treatment process is separation of oil and aqueous phase. Consequently, it is important to examine the conditions which enable the maximum separation effect and provide satisfactory quality of the aqueous phase before discharge into natural recipients. This paper examines the effects of temperature and addition of demulsifier and <b>dewatering</b> <b>agent</b> on phase separation in oily wastewaters. The best separation rate and the highest quantity of the aqueous phase are achieved with the addition of demulsifier in concentration of 500 mg/l and the <b>dewatering</b> <b>agent</b> in concentration of 500 mg/l at 60 °C. The quality of the aqueous phase after separation shows low values of mineral oils and high COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) values due to the remaining demulsifier and <b>dewatering</b> <b>agent</b> in aqueous phase. For that reason it is necessary to use additional treatments, such as adsorption on active carbon or biological treatment before discharge into natural waters...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} α,ω-diamines of polyoxyethylene–polyoxypropylene–polyoxyethylene (POE–POP–POE) triblock {{copolymer}} was synthesized and experimentally evaluated as <b>dewatering</b> <b>agents</b> for heavy crude oil. A quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) {{study of the}} effect of the secondary amine structure over the yield of nucleophilic substitution reactions with α,ω-ditosylate ester of PEO–PPO–PEO triblock copolymer was performed exclusively at the DFT level. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis including softness or hardness parameters gave R 2  =  0. 9062, producing an equation with an acceptable rm(test) 2 value. Furthermore, {{in order to understand the}} physicochemical interaction between the functionalizing copolymers and water, QSAR models based on AM 1 semiempirical and DFT (B 3 LYP functional) descriptors were carried out for comparative purposes. For the MLR analysis at the AM 1 level, R 2  =  0. 9058, whereas at the DFT level, R 2  =  0. 9879. 2 -(Methylamino) ethanol was employed to evaluate the equations obtained. The residual of the logERcalc SN 2 reaction was − 0. 0043, showing a good correlation with experimental efficiency. Regarding water removal efficiency, the residuals of logWRcalc at the AM 1 and DFT levels were of 0. 0220 and 0. 0041, respectively. Even though, DFT produced a better correlation, a QSAR study at the AM 1 level could be employed to study the behavior of α,ω-diamines of PEO–PPO–PEO triblock copolymer and to destabilize water/oil emulsions, with a computational cost relatively low compared to DFT calculations...|$|R

40|$|At the {{construction}} permit (CP) stage, ETSB reviews the design objectives, criteria, performance objectives, and {{description of the}} solid waste system (SWS) as given in the applicant's preliminary safety analysis report (PSAR). During the operating license (OL) stage of review, ETSB confirms the design accepted at the CP stage and evaluates the applicant's process control program and technical specifica-tions in these areas. ETSB reviews the following: 1. The design objectives in terms of expected and design volumes of waste to be processed and handled, the wet and dry types of waste to be processed (e. g., sludges, resins, evaporator bottoms, and dry material such as contaminated tools, equipment, rags, paper, and clothing), the activity and expected radio-nuclide distribution contained in the waste, equipment design capacities, and the principal parameters employed {{in the design of}} the SWS. 2. The description of the SWS, the piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), and the process flow diagrams showing the methods of operation, the expected chemical content and radionuclide concentrations of liquid wastes to be processed and handled by the SWS, and the expected volumes to be returned to the liquid radwaste system for further treatment. 3. The description of the methods for solidification (i. e., of removal of free water), the description of the methods for <b>dewatering,</b> the solidifying <b>agent</b> used, and the implementation of a process control program to ensure a solid matrix and proper waste form characteristics and/or complete dewatering...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of, and impediments to, {{effective management}} of newspaper waste in Australia are addressed. It is appreciated {{that it is}} vital to establish facilities to recycle and reprocess newspaper as an avenue for appreciating the value of newspaper. The existence of collection industries depends on the creation of markets for the reprocessed material. Options for reprocessing waste newspaper are identified, and include the manufacture of pulp moulded products, building materials, animal bedding, animal fodder and file folders. Newspaper can also be used as a <b>dewatering</b> <b>agent</b> and as an industrial and domestic fuel source. The viability of establishing reprocessing facilities in Tasmania is considered on environmental, technical and economic grounds. On purely economic terms, {{it was found that the}} use of newspaper as a source of industrial fuel and in the production of non-adhesive bonded panel board are the most attractive means of generating a demand for waste newspaper. Avenues for governmental, community and industrial intervention to encourage further use of waste newspaper are examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{final step}} of the Bayer process, {{involving}} the calcination of Al(OH) 3 to alumina (Al 2 O 3), is {{a significant source of}} Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emission. In this paper we show that a typical <b>dewatering</b> <b>agent</b> (DWA), dioctyl sodiumsuccinate, decomposes to a series VOCs under conditions that are representative of an industrial calcination stack. At lower temperatures of 300 - 700 °C, the predominant VOC released is 3 -methyleneheptane (3 -MH), due to cleavage of the alkyl-O bond in the additive precursor. Benzene is the predominate VOC generated at temperatures above 700 °C, along with lesser quantities of toluene, styrene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene and traces of thiophene. In the temperature range 700 - 900 °C, the benzene:toluene ratio steadily increases from 1 : 1 to approximately 6 : 1 under the conditions employed. The use of surfactants to minimise moisture content before calcination is thus shown to directly lead to the release of environmentally sensitive VOCs in alumina calcination stacks, and a more complete understanding of total VOC emission from all stages of the Bayer process is thus established...|$|E
