The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Topical or {{systemic}} administration of 5 -aminolaevulinic acid results in biosynthesis of the photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) with some selectivity for malignant lesions.

40|$|Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} a common {{occurrence}} in liver surgery. In orthotopic transplantation, the donor liver is exposed to periods of ischemia and when oxygenated blood is reintroduced to the liver, oxidative stress may develop and lead to graft failure. The aim of this project was to investigate whether noninvasive multiphoton and <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime <b>imaging</b> microscopy, without external markers, were useful in detecting early liver damage caused by I/R injury. Localized hepatic ischemia was induced in rats for 1 h followed by 4 h reperfusion. Multiphoton and <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime <b>imaging</b> microscopy was conducted prior to ischemia and up to 4 h of reperfusion and compared to morphological and biochemical assessment of liver damage. Liver function was significantly impaired at 2 and 4 h of reperfusion. Multiphoton microscopy detected liver damage at 1 h of reperfusion, manifested by vacuolated cells and heterogeneous spread of damage over the liver. The damage was mainly localized in the midzonal region of the liver acinus. In addition, <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime <b>imaging</b> showed a decrease in cellular metabolic activity. Multiphoton and <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime <b>imaging</b> microscopy detected evidence of early I/R injury both structurally and functionally.
