40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of sensor nodes is a sizzling issue,given the severe resource constraints of sensor nodes andpervasive nature of sensor networks. The base station beinglocated at variable distances from the nodes in the sensor field,each node actually dissipates a different {{amount of energy}} totransmit data to the same. The LEACH [4] and PEGASIS [5]protocols provide elegant solutions to this problem, but may notalways result in optimal performance. In this paper we haveproposed a novel data gathering protocol for enhancing thenetwork lifetime by optimizing energy dissipation in the nodes. To achieve our design objective we have applied particle swarmoptimization (PSO) with Simulated Annealing (SA) to form asub-optimal data <b>gathering</b> <b>chain</b> and devised a method forselecting an efficient leader for communicating to the basestation. In our scheme each node only communicates with aclose neighbor and takes turns in being the leader depending onits residual energy and location. This helps to rule out theunequal energy dissipation by the individual nodes of thenetwork and results in superior performance as compared toLEACH and PEGASIS. Extensive computer simulations havebeen carried out which shows that significant improvement isover these schemes...|$|E
40|$|Growers of 38 –cm (15 –in.) narrow row corn {{typically}} {{use either}} a wider row cornhead or locally modify an existing head to this row spacing. A three–year field experiment compared visible machine losses of a 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead used on 76 –cm (30 –in.) and 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows {{and a single}} <b>gathering</b> <b>chain</b> 38 –cm (15 –in.) cornhead used on 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows. Total machine losses were divided into head and threshing/separating losses. On matched row spacing, machine losses were generally similar between the 76 – and 38 –cm (30 – and 15 –in.) cornhead. However, one–year losses from the 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead were statistically lower. Machine ear drop losses were excessive [0. 9 to 1. 3 Mg/ha (15 to 20 bu/acre) in two of three years] and unacceptable when a 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead was used even at low 3. 2 –km/h (2 –mph) travel speeds to harvest corn in 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows. At low feed rates, over 90 % of machine losses occurred at the cornhead {{rather than in the}} threshing, separating, and cleaning areas. Header losses occurred due to ear drop from late season harvest and negligible losses inside the machine when operated at 4. 8 km/h (3 mph). Although shelling of kernels on the stalk rolls was about 1 % of harvested yield or less, ear drop loss from the cornhead was greater than this amount in two of three years...|$|E

Then she waited in tranquil dignity, the only person there who seemed unmoved and unexcited. A bronzed and brawny English soldier, standing at martial ease in the front rank of the citizen spectators, did now most gallantly and respectfully put up his great hand and give her the military salute; and she, smiling friendly, put up hers and returned it; whereat there was a sympathetic little break of applause, which the judge sternly silence.|$|R

It {{has been a}} great event in Asia Pacific area with the rapid growth of Rubber tyre industry in China and more than ten years’ development and innovation. The scale of event keeps expanding and will hit a new record to create great <b>gathering</b> for the <b>chains</b> of rubber tire industry from downstream to upstream.

2500|$|From July to November 1959, Collins and Lomax made a {{folk song}} {{collecting}} {{trip in the}} Southern states. It resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, and Bessie Jones, and is noted for the discovery of Mississippi Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued by Atlantic Records under the title [...] "Sounds of the South", and some were re-enacted in the Coen brothers’ film Oh Brother, Where Art Thou. The experience of her life with Lomax, {{and the making of}} the recordings in religious communities, social <b>gatherings,</b> prisons and <b>chain</b> gangs was described in Collins' book America Over the Water (published 2005).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} guaranteed minimum price contracts between sub-groups of farmers and a fair trade manufacturer on the spot market price. We focus on the fair trade concept in the coffee supply chain as an example. We analyze a three level vertical <b>chain</b> <b>gathering</b> perfectly competitive farmers upstream who offer their raw product to manufacturers who then sell finished products to a downstream retailer. Without fair trade, all the raw product is sold on the spot market. When a sub-group of farmers benefit from a guaranteed minimum price contract offered by a fair trade certifier, we show that farmers outside of this fair trade agreement may also benefit from a higher spot market price in cases of a limited overproduction.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} Fair Trade contracts between sub-groups of farmers and a Fair Trade organization on the spot market price. We analyze a three level vertical <b>chain</b> <b>gathering</b> perfectly competitive farmers upstream who offer their raw product on a spot market to manufacturers who then sell finished products to a downstream retailer. Absent Fair Trade, the entire raw product is sold on the spot market. When a Fair Trade organization offers a Fair Trade contract to a sub-group of farmers, it gathers a Guaranteed Minimum Price clause and a straight relationship between the sub-group of farmers and the retailer. This article highlights several conditions such that a snowball effect exists, i. e farmers outside of the Fair Trade contract also benefit from a higher spot market price.

40|$|AbstractSurvival in today's global {{environment}} means continuously improving processes, identifying and eliminating inefficiencies wherever they occur. With so many companies operating as part {{or all of}} complex distributed supply <b>chain,</b> <b>gathering,</b> collating and analyzing the necessary data to identify such improvement opportunities is extremely complex and costly. Although few solutions exist to correlate the data, {{it continues to be}} generated in vast quantities, rendering the use of highly scalable, cloud-based solutions for process analysis a necessity. In this paper we present an overview of an analytical framework for business activity monitoring and analysis, which has been realized using extremely scalable, cloud-based technologies. It provides a low-latency solution for entire supply chains or individual nodes in such chains to query process data stores in order to deliver business insight. A custom query language has been implemented which allows business analysts to design custom queries on processes and activities based on a standard set of process metrics. Ongoing developments are focused on testing and improving the scalability and latency of the system, as well as extending the query engine to increase its flexibility and performance...|$|R
