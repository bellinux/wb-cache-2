In all its iterations, the fold appears as two constitutive items: the fold as self-similarity, which implies recursion; the fold within the fold, and in turn, the fold as continuous discontinuity. The persistence of this conception of <b>die</b> <b>fold</b> will be demonstrated through a discussion of Leibniz's Monadology, Deleuze's Le Pli, and some mathematical ideas from catastrophe and chaos theory. This raises the issue of continuity between disciplines and thus the philosophical status this confers on the fold...|$|R

While a Network-on-Chip systematically tackles this physical issue by differentiating between local and global interconnects, 3 D-Integration by <b>folding</b> the <b>die</b> into multiple layers and using short vertical links instead of long horizontal interconnects, leads to a considerable reduction in the length {{and the number of}} long global wires. This chapter elaborates on the strategic exploitation of these two key technologies, where the use of the third dimension {{in the design of the}} integrated networks provides a major improvement in the network performance. It makes a case for using asynchronous circuits to implement 3 D-NoCs. We claim that asynchronous logic allows benefiting from serialized vertical link leading to the definition of innovative architectures which can address some critical issues of 3 D integrated circuits using Through-Silicon-Vias. This allows complying with the cost-efficiency trade-off of the 3 D-Integration paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Ventura basin is an {{elongate}} sedimentary trough {{extending from}} the San Gabriel fault west into the Santa Barbara Channel. West of Ventura it contains over 4 km of severely deformed Pliocene and Pleistocene clastic strata. The north-dipping Red Mountain reverse fault system, which forms the northern boundary of the basin, has been active since the early Pliocene and has maximum reverse separation of 7300 m (23, 900 ft). In the basin, the Grubb and Oak Grove faults were active in the early Pleistocene and were reactivated during late Pleistocene folding. Both are tear faults that dip steeply northeast and strike northwest, {{in contrast to the}} west-trending structural grain of the region. The Rincon anticline is the western extension of the Ventura Avenue anticline. Both anticlines formed approximately 200, 000 years ago as rootless <b>folds</b> which <b>die</b> out in subjacent fine-grained Miocene strata. Above the Rincon anticline synchronous shortening occurred on the Javon Canyon/Padre Juan fault and San Miguelito anticline. The Padre Juan fault is a south-dipping reverse fault that flattens over the axis of the Rincon anticline and dies out to the north. Where it flattens, the Javon Canyon fault rises upwards and offsets 3500 year old marine terrace deposits at the surface. Maximum reverse separation across the Javon Canyon/Padre Juan fault is 2800 m (9200 ft). The steeply north-dipping to overfolded region between the Javon Canyon and Padre Juan faults constitutes {{a large portion of the}} north limb of the San Miguelito anticline. This anticline, constrained above the Padre Juan fault, is a complex example of a fault-propagation fold. Total shortening in the Ventura basin along a cross-section through the study area is approximately 7825 m (25, 700 ft). For the last 200, 000 years this north-south directed shortening has occurred at a rate of 12. 5 to 22. 3 mm/yr (0. 49 to 0. 87 in/yr). These values compare favorably with shortening values obtained at other locations in the basin, and support the concept of decreasing horizontal contraction from east to west across the basin for the last 200, 000 years...|$|R
40|$|SECTION I: The {{geologic}} structures {{produced by}} two distributions of applied vertical displacement along {{the base of}} a homogeneous layer, (1) a broad curve and (2) a sharp step, were investigated analytically and experimentally. A special form of the general theory of elasticity and scale models (with layers of dry sands and clay) were used for a two dimensional analytical and experimental study of these structures. Each of the two distributions of applied vertical displacement produce a characteristic fracture pattern in the model experiments. For a broad curve, the fracture pattern is a complex zone of normal faults which taper inward to the axis of the <b>fold</b> and <b>die</b> out at depth. For a sharp step, the fracture pattern is (1) a series of curved reverse faults which start steeply {{at the base of the}} layer but intersect the upper surface at low angles (thrusts), and (2) a series of normal faults in the uplifted block near the reverse faults. The initial fractures in the model experiments, for example the curved reverse faults, can be predicted on the basis of the Mohr fracture criterion and the stress distributions found in the elastic analyses. In addition, the displacement fields obtained in the elastic analyses are good first order approximations of the displacement fields observed in the model experiments. SECTION II: A gravity survey (640 stations) was conducted over thirty-six square miles of the alluvium covered portion of the Raymond and San Gabriel basins. Corrections for latitude, elevation, and topography were applied to the gravity data. On the basis of the known surface and sub-surface geology, regional gravity due to deep crustal structure, and gravity due to near surface structure were separated and interpreted independently. The regional gravity due to deep crustal structure indicates a uniform thickening of the earth's crust to the northeast. If all of the regional gravity is attributed to a density difference of 0. 5 c. g. s. at the Mohorovicic discontinuity, the rate of thickening is about 100 meters per kilometer. The distribution of gravity due to near surface structure shows two steep gradient valleys in the bedrock surface beneath the alluvium in the northern part of the area. The elevation to the floor of these valleys indicates at least 1000 feet of subsidence since the deposition of the alluvium (Upper Pleistocene). The bedrock relief is fairly gentle in the southern part of the area where Tertiary rock lies between bedrock and alluvium. This intermediate layer of Tertiary rock may extend more than a mile north of the Raymond fault. The vertical displacement on the Raymond fault may be 600 feet along one section of the fault in east Arcadia...|$|R

40|$|Im Laufe dieser Arbeit wurde eine systematische Analyse an 93 Epoxidhydrolase (EH) Sequenzen durchgeführt. Ein Vergleich der drei bekannten EH Strukturen aus Agrobacterium radiobacter, Mus musculus und Aspergillus niger zeigte die hohe Konservierung des a/b Hydrolase <b>Folds</b> und <b>die</b> Existenz zweier variabler Loop-Regionen, dem NC-und dem Cap-Loop. Aus dem Multisequenz-Alignment der 93 EHs wurden die Loop-Längen aller EHs bestimmt und in einem Diagramm gegeneinander aufgetragen. Hierbei bildeten sich drei nach Superfamilien und Organismengruppen getrennte Cluster. Jedes Cluster enthält eine der drei bekannten Strukturen. Unter der Annahme, dass ähnliche Loop-Längen eine ähnliche Struktur bedingen, konnten Homologiemodelle von fünf EHs erstellt werden. Vergleiche der Substratspektren mit der Cluster Zugehörigkeit führten zu der Annahme, dass Loop-Länge und Substratspezifität korrelieren, da z. B. nur für EHs mit langen Cap-Loops der Umsatz epoxidierter Fettsäuren beschrieben wurde. Mit dem Programm CODEHOP wurden degenerierte familienspezifische Primer erstellt und an zwei bakteriellen Organismen getestet. Aus Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 4, welcher eine EH Aktivität gegen Styroloxid aufweist und Rhodococcus ruber LU 760 konnten jeweils Fragmente mit signifikanter Homologie zu EHs amplifiziert werden. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit befaßt sich mit der Erstellung und Auswertung einer familienspezifischen Datenbank auf der Grundlage der Lipase Engineering Database (LED). Die Epoxidhydrolase/Haloalkandehalogenase (EH/HD) Datenbank enthält 397 Sequenz-einträge, 305 Proteineinträge und für 19 dieser Proteineinträge 51 Strukturdatensätze. Neben EHs und HDs enthält die Datenbank weitere Enzymfamilien, die in 14 homologe Familien und zwei Superfamilien eingeteilt wurden. Untersuchungen der Strukturen aus EH/HD Datenbank und LED zeigten, dass trotz massiver struktureller Unterschiede, zwischen den Strukturen dieser beiden Datenbanken, das katalytische Zentrum strukturell in allen a/b Hydrolasen erhalten ist. Auch das für Lipasen ermittelte Anker-Konzept für die Stabilisierung des Oxyanionholes greift bei den Proteinen der EH/HD Datenbank. Für das hochkonservierte GXGXS-Motiv konnte eine mögliche strukturrelevante Funktion entwickelt werden, die seine konservierte Struktur und Lage erklärt. Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) from {{eukaryotic}} and prokaryotic {{sources were}} found to be applicable for the kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of epoxides, and high enantiomeric accesses have been reported. Enantiopure epoxides and vicinal diols are extensively employed as useful chiral building blocks for synthesis of various bioactive products in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry. Aim of this work was to identify similarities and differences in this highly divers enzyme family by systematic analysis of available EH sequences and structures. 93 different EHs were identified by keyword and BLAST search. A phylogenetic analysis showed the clear separation into the two separate superfamilies cytosolic (cEHs) and microsomal (mEHs) EHs and several homologous families within each superfamily. In contrast to eukaryotic EHs, bacterial EHs show a high variability and barley form any well defined homologous families. EHs belong to the family of a/b hydrolases. Analysis of the three known structures from Agrobacterium radiobacter, Mus musculus und Aspergillus niger lead to division of the modular structures into N-terminal domain, N-terminal catalytic domain, NC-loop, cap-domain, cap-loop und C-terminal catalytic domain. Besides obvious differences in molecule size of the three structures, caused by the variable N-terminal domain, EHs contain a highly conserved a/b hydrolase fold only interrupted by two variable loops: NC- (connects N-terminal catalytic domain and cap-domain) and cap-loop (located within the cap-domain). The bacterial EH from Agrobacterium radiobacter contains short loops, the EH from Mus musculus contains a medium sized NC-loop and a long cap-loop and the microsomal EH from Aspergillus niger contains a long NC-loop and a short cap-loop. Loop-lengths of all EHs were determined using the multisequence alignment of 93 EHs and were plotted against each other. Three clusters ordered by superfamily and organisms were formed, each containing one known structure. Although EHs contain a highly conserved structure, they show low sequences identities, what complicates reliable homology modelling. Assuming that EHs of one cluster, and thus with similar loop-lengths posses a similar structure, the loop-based classification into clusters and the multisequence alignment of 93 EHs was used to perform homology models of five representative EHs. Of 78 % of all 93 EHs the complete structure can be predicted using the insights resulting from the systematic analysis. Another application for the loop-based assignment into clusters, is the prediction of substrate specificity of EHs. Looking at the substrate spectra of EHs, it is remarkable that EHs with long cap-loops are able to convert epoxy fatty acids, while EHs containing long NC-loops accept epoxy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as substrates. The assignment to homologous families received from the phylogenetic analysis was used for the design of family specific primers. Tests of these primers were performed with two bacterial organisms. Streptomyces antibioticus Tü 4 shows EH activity towards styrene oxide. An already amplified fragment of this species was located in the branch of the bacterial EHs of cluster I. With primers specific for this group, a fragment with significant homology to EHs was amplified. After purification, N-terminal sequencing and tryptic digestion, it was possible to complement the fragment N-terminal. Using the same set of primers, amplification of a fragment from genomic DNA from Rhodococcus ruber (LU 760) was also possible. The second part of this work is concerned with building up and interpretation of a family specific database. The epoxide hydrolase/haloalkane dehalogenase database (EH/HD) is an extension to the 93 EH alignment with inclusion of further enzyme families and structure information. A set of representative sequences was used for BLAST searches. The collected data was ordered hierarchically by the database system DWARF in protein entry, homologous family and superfamily. The database consists of 397 sequence entries, 305 protein entries and contains for 19 protein entries 51 structure data sets, which were combined into 14 homologous families and two superfamilies. The GXGXS-Motif is highly conserved and forms a structurally also highly conserved loop. The GXGXS-Motif occurs only in the structures of the EH/HD database and is located beneath the first two b-strands of the a/b hydrolase fold and the cap-helice a 4 and a 5, which are connected by hydrogen-bonds. The positions of the five residues involved in hydrogen bonding of the strands b 1 and b 2 and the GXGXS-motif are structurally conserved. Hydrogen bonding between GXGXS-Motif and cap-domain is more variable, but all residues involved are located at the loop between the cap-helices a 4 and a 5. The GXGXS-Motif stabilizes the strands b 1 and b 2 and is acting like a lock, connecting cap domain and N-terminal catalytic domain...|$|R
