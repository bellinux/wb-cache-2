25|$|SS is {{associated}} with increased levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of IL-1RA, an interleukin 1 antagonist. This suggests that the disease begins with increased activity in the interleukin 1 system, followed by an autoregulatory up-regulation of IL-1RA to reduce the successful binding of interleukin 1 to its receptors. Interleukin 1 likely is the marker <b>for</b> <b>fatigue,</b> but increased IL-1RA is observed in the CSF and {{is associated}} with increased fatigue through cytokine-induced sickness behavior. SS, though, is characterized by decreased levels of IL-1ra in saliva, which could be responsible for mouth inflammation and dryness.

25|$|On 6 December 1978, Embraer {{was officially}} awarded a {{contract}} to produce two prototypes and two airframes <b>for</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests. The specifications were concluded in February 1979, and the main differences from the EMB-311 were the more powerful PT6A-25C engine, raised rear cockpit, {{and the addition of}} ejection seats. Eventually, the original specifications underwent a major modification, including a smaller fuselage with an upright cruciform tail instead of a swept-back tail; a more domed canopy; extended elevators; greater distance between the nosewheel and back wheel; reduction of the wing root; and an increased wingspan, tailplane, and landing gear. By late 1979, a full-scale mock-up was built with a cockpit for the evaluation of flight instruments, and a subscale, radio-controlled research model was designed to evaluate the free-flight characteristics before building a full-scale prototype.|$|E

The derailment was caused by a fatigue failure in the front axle of the train. All Class 71 and 73 trains were immediately grounded, and were investigated by maintenance crews. The derailed train had recently had its axle checked <b>for</b> <b>fatigue,</b> but no cracks had been found. On 19 June, NSB stated that they had made insufficient tests during the [...] controls. Class 71 had been through ultrasonic testing and were therefore allowed to resume operation the day after the accident.
