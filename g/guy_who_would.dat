500|$|Davis is {{from the}} South Side of Chicago and played high school {{basketball}} for Perspectives Charter School, where he had attended school since sixth grade. The team plays in {{a division of the}} Chicago Public High School League, known as the Blue Division, that is ignored by the media because of its lower level of competition. Perspectives is a charter school that operates as a math and science academy with high academic pedigree, but minimal athletic success. The school had no gymnasium and Davis' middle school basketball teams practiced at a nearby church. In junior high school, he was known as [...] "the little <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> shoot threes from the corner". He ended his freshman year at a height of [...] By the beginning of his sophomore year, he had grown another , and he finished the year at [...]|$|E
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered {{he was the kind of}} <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Martin family {{finally settled}} in the San Francisco Bay Area in about 1976. Martin {{attended}} Galileo High School and met up {{with some of the}} <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> join him in his first successful venture - the band [...] "Kid Courage". Kid Courage opened for AC/DC for two shows in the Bay Area, which were actually AC/DC's first shows in America.|$|R
5000|$|Geppi {{and family}} vacationed every summer in Wildwood, New Jersey. In {{the summer of}} 1972, his nephew (Georgie Kues) was [...] "reading an old Batman comic book" [...] in the rain, and Geppi found that [...] "reading that Batman brought his {{childhood}} memories of comics... He still loved comics and figured {{there were a lot}} of <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> feel the same way." [...] Buying [...] "a batch of old comics from a woman on his mail route," [...] he was soon [...] "spending weekends at comic shows, buying and trading with other fans." [...] After [...] "setting up at comic book conventions as a part-time dealer," [...] he ultimately realised that he could make more money that way than at his job with the postal services.|$|R
500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little <b>guy!</b> <b>Who</b> <b>would</b> suspect this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a pain in her ass." [...] Shari Elliker, a WBAL (AM) disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.|$|E
500|$|After {{it became}} known that Billy, not Cane, fathered Chloe's {{daughter}} Delia, journalist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline that involved Chloe, Lily, Billy and Cane as [...] "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs". Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end way too quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially I hated the pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lily’s face a few years back, but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> do something like this to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E
5000|$|During this period, Landers {{went on to}} {{continue}} {{to pay homage to}} Duchamp and Picasso as well as other artists with which he shares a personal affinity, Picabia, Magritte, Dali, De Chirico, Braque, Beckmann, and Ernst by depicting them either as clowns or as ghosts. Landers said, “Painting someone as a clown is putting them in my pantheon, you know? It’s not an insult. Painting them as a ghost is similar. So I was communicating with Max Ernst, and Picabia. But there was another level, too. What I like about the Surrealists is that they are <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> sit in front of a blank canvas and allow their stream-of-consciousness to in some way fill the emptiness. Which is exactly what I am doing when I fill a giant empty white canvas with text...but in a different way.” ...|$|R
5000|$|A regular {{columnist}} at Gil Blas, he met <b>Guy</b> de Maupassant <b>who</b> <b>would</b> dedicate him {{his short}} story [...] From 1896 to 1906, he was theatre {{manager for the}} Théâtre de l'Odéon, then became an inspector of monuments historiques.|$|R
2500|$|Former wrestler Christopher Nowinski {{stated that}} Benoit {{may have been}} {{suffering}} from repeated, untreated concussions throughout his wrestling career, ultimately leading to an unstable mental state. Nowinski {{was quoted as saying}} that Benoit [...] "was one of the only <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> take a chair shot {{to the back of the}} head... which is stupid". Tests conducted on Benoit's brain by Julian Bailes, the head of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, showed [...] "Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient". Other tests conducted on Benoit's brain tissue revealed severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and damage to all four lobes of the brain and brain stem. Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia, which can contribute to severe behavioral problems. Benoit's father said that brain damage may have been the leading cause of the double murder-suicide. A statement released by WWE dismissed this idea as [...] "speculative".|$|R
2500|$|When {{it came to}} {{casting the}} movie, Hill wanted {{to go with a}} young group of {{relative}} unknowns. Gross says [...] "There was always the idea {{that we were going to}} discover a new Steve McQueen, you know? A young, white <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> ride a motorcycle and have a carbine over his shoulder and be a mainstream icon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his death, {{a number of}} {{television}} hosts and other actors paid tribute to his comedy talents. Among them was a tribute by Jimmy Kimmel, who recalled Rickles as a [...] "towering presence in Las Vegas," [...] where Kimmel grew up. Seth Meyers, said [...] "there's nothing better than getting burned by Don Rickles", while David Letterman noted that Rickles [...] "was always a highlight for me. Just endless mischief and nonsense, and a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> make the audience go completely crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the Yankees {{lifted the}} 9-year alcohol ban {{in the bleachers}} in the New Yankee Stadium, where the Bleacher Creatures were {{relocated}} to Section 203. While no beer vendors come through to the bleachers, fans are permitted to purchase beer in the stadium and take {{them back to their}} seats. A few Creatures have admittedly stated they can now desist in their beer smuggling efforts, which they were able to do for years with the help of local delis who used to wrap up sandwiches with beer cans. Other sources of previous smuggling included [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> sell those airline-size liquor bottles out of a bathroom stall, like a drug dealer." [...] An April 2009 segment on ABC World News Tonight revealed {{that the end of the}} beer ban is a temporary experiment, and if things get out of hand in the section, the Yankees' management might reinstate it.|$|E
50|$|The dioxin crisis {{strongly}} influenced the federal elections of 1999 (as {{well as the}} regional elections of 1999). The governing party, Christian People's Party (CVP), suffered a historic loss and forced the end of premier Jean-Luc Dehaene's eight-year reign. This meant {{a victory for the}} VLD and <b>Guy</b> Verhofstadt, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become Prime Minister of Belgium until 2007. Green parties Ecolo and Agalev were also able to profit from the public concern around environment and food quality.|$|R
50|$|Gonick {{was born}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1973. His father, Cy Gonick, is a reputed Marxist {{economist}} and {{former member of the}} Manitoba Legislature. As a youth, Noam showed a strong interest in theatre. While in elementary school, he started a small theatre company composed of other children from his neighborhood. At 16, he lived briefly in Berlin, Germany, where he worked as an actor in an experimental theatre troupe. After returning to Canada, he met and began working with filmmaker <b>Guy</b> Maddin, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have a seminal influence upon his early work.|$|R
50|$|The conciliatory {{approach}} of Murray {{in dealing with}} the demands of the Canadians was not well received by the merchants. In May 1764, they petitioned the king for Murray's removal, accusing him of betraying the interests of Great Britain by his defence of the Canadian people's interests. The merchants succeeded in having him recalled to London. He was vindicated, but did not return to the Province of Quebec. In 1768, he was replaced by Sir <b>Guy</b> Carleton, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> contribute to the drafting of the 1774 Quebec Act.|$|R
2500|$|Tony was {{originally}} {{described as a}} [...] "loveable geek {{and the sort of}} <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> instantly and completely fall in love". He is described as the [...] "oldest friend" [...] of Kurt Benson (Jeremy Edwards) and [...] "the anithesis of Kurt, sensitive and keen to settle down, Tony lacked Kurt's confidence with women". An early official Hollyoaks website, Hollyoaks.com, described Tony as [...] "A worrier, who lacks self-confidence but always does the decent thing". A more recent official Hollyoaks website describes Tony saying: [...] "Tony has had what you would call [...] "a colourful life". Quite the Romeo, he has been married TWICE. [...] On top of that there's been numerous engagements, romances and flings [...] A natural-born entrepreneur, he has built (and lost) a business empire that would make Sir Alan [...] proud, encompassing burger bars, launderettes, health spas and restaurants [...] He may be down but he's certainly not out. NEVER underestimate the Hutch".|$|E
2500|$|Hank {{referred}} to Chuck D {{as being the}} person who'd find all the vocal samples, Eric Sadler as [...] "the one with the musical talent," [...] and noted that his brother, Keith Shocklee, [...] "knew {{a lot of the}} breakbeats and was the sound-effects master." [...] Shocklee's sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group's working methods during production. [...] "Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician. Eric did a lot of the [...] programming, [...] Keith was the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> bring in the feel." [...] For his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he [...] "would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth. I would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples." [...] Chuck D also noted the productiveness of Sadler and Shocklee's differing approaches to the creative process. [...] "The friction between Hank and Eric worked very well. Hank would put a twist on Eric's musicianship and Eric's musicianship would put a twist on Hank." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the editor}} of Book World from 1967-1969, Dobell {{published}} numerous book reviews by Mario Puzo, including the first book review Puzo ever wrote.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "What's My Age Again?", {{directed}} by Marcos Siega, features the band {{running in the}} nude {{through the streets of}} Los Angeles, as well as through commercials and daily news programs. The trio only slow down when they spot porn star Janine Lindemulder (the model featured on the cover of Enema of the State). The trio wore flesh-colored Speedos for most of the scenes. [...] "Watching people's faces in the cars as they drove past us was the best," [...] Hoppus told Rolling Stone. [...] "They almost got into accidents. They just saw these ugly blobs running down the street." [...] Siega had known the band for many years at that point, having seen them play small clubs years before. [...] "I knew they were just funny, crazy <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> pretty much be up for anything. ... I just kind of wrote the [...] "What's My Age Again?"

50|$|Gent's {{apprenticeship}} was {{an unhappy}} one, and in 1710 he absconded, and stowed way on a ship, arriving in Wirral, England, then travelled to London {{where he took}} up apprenticeship under Edward Midwinter. After completing his apprenticeship in 1713, he worked briefly for a Mrs. Bradford, and then for a printer named Mears, who involved him in a humiliating initiation rite, discharging him soon after, following which he subsisted by labouring. After several months he obtained a post with John White, King's printer for York, {{at a rate of}} £18 a year, plus board and lodging, arriving in April 1714.

After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|R

50|$|The Number One tower {{soon found}} an {{alternative}} {{use as a}} replacement for the Nab Rock lightship, 40 miles away off Bembridge in the Isle of Wight. On 12 September 1920, it was towed out of Shoreham harbour by five Admiralty tugs, watched by a crowd of thousands and was sunk on a sand spit next to the rock on the following day. The Nab Tower is still in use today. The second tower remained at Shoreham until 1924 when it was demolished over a period of 6 months.

2500|$|The {{voice of}} Peter is {{provided}} by MacFarlane, who also provides the voice for Brian, Stewie and Quagmire. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, most prominently those of news anchor Tom Tucker, Carter Pewterschmidt (Lois' father), and Dr. Hartman. MacFarlane {{has been part of}} the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, as well he has been voicing Peter from the start. MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and the rest of characters' voices himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane's speaking voice is not very close to Peter's; he uses his normal voice as the voice of Brian. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from the security guards he overheard talking while he was attending the Rhode Island School of Design; according to him, [...] "I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up in New England. <b>Guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not think before they spoke, like [...] there was no self-editing mechanism. [...] Everything in here, [...] it's coming out here". MacFarlane also voices many of Peter's ancestors who share the same type of voice. He noted in an interview that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom to do it himself. In another interview, he mentioned that Peter's voice is one of the most difficult to do.|$|R
