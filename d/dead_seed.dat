40|$|A two-year {{field study}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} different seed quality on plant stand and seed yield. Mixing dead seeds ranging from 5 to 50 % into high quality seeds, eleven different seed qualities were created. The study was planted in the experimental field of Cukurova University on a silt loam soil in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. <b>Dead</b> <b>seed</b> rate had significant affect on the number of plant per hectare. The highest plant population was obtained from no <b>dead</b> <b>seed</b> added treatment and the lowest was obtained from 50 % <b>dead</b> <b>seed</b> added treatment in both years. Pod number and seed number per plant increased with the decreasing number of plant per hectare. Seed yield was positively correlated with seed quality and number of plant per hectare.

40|$|Abstract Festuca Arundinacea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} fodder plants, successfully grown in România. Festuca Arundinacea crop quality depends on the quality of seeds, therefore vigour tests are essential, as they describe the behaviour of seeds under various growth conditions. The paper aims at assessing the quality of Festuca Arundinacea seeds and the efficiency of the methods to determine them. The biological material used consisted of Festuca Arundinacea seeds, Palma variety, stored in uncontrolled conditions, one year after harvest. The present paper assesses several seed parameters: total germination, normal seedlings, abnormal seedlings, <b>dead</b> <b>seeds,</b> seed weight, as well as the appearance of normal seedlings (after 7 to 14 days) through three laboratory methods: BP (between paper) test (V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4), sand S test (V 5) and top of paper TP test (V 6). Seed germination percentage for Palma variety ranged from 74 % (V 4) to 79 % (V 1 and V 6). Low germination is especially caused by the large number of <b>dead</b> <b>seeds,</b> the main cause being the improper storage conditions. According to the results of this experiment, cluster analysis showed the efficiency of the BP test, without pre-cooling, and of TP test, in emphasizing the quality characteristics of Festuca arundinacea seeds, Palma variety.

40|$|International audienceJerusalem {{artichoke}} is {{a valuable}} source of inulin, a polysaccharide. Inulin is a sustainable source of dietary fiber that enhances the immune system in humans. Although Jerusalem artichoke can be propagated vegetatively, breeders use cross-fertilization to produce novel varieties and hybrids with higher inulin yields. Seed dormancy can hinder the breeding progress because dormancy reduces the number of generations a breeder can obtain in 1  year. Current methods for breaking seed dormancy are time consuming and usually involve removing or pin-pricking the seed coat of these very small seeds, or using several weeks of seed vernalization or several months of storage. Breeders thus require better methods that are less time consuming and achieve higher germination percentages. Here, we studied germination, dormant seed, <b>dead</b> <b>seed,</b> and the seedling growth rate of different Jerusalem artichoke genotypes and seed lots after seeds were treated with different methods to break seed dormancy. We evaluated fresh and stored seed lots using the following treatments: seed samples were planted on top of media moistened with either potassium nitrate, gibberellic acid, or distilled water as control. Two identical sets of samples were planted: one set was germinated in a chamber at alternate 15 – 25  °C for 28  days, while the second set was pre-chilled at 5  °C for 14  days, before moving the samples to the alternate 15 – 25  °C chamber for 14  days. Our findings reveal that the highest germination percentage up to 85. 3  % was obtained when applying pre-chill with gibberellic acid.

40|$|Significant {{differences}} in seed vigour within lots of red clover cv. Pawera, white clover cv. Huia and lucerne cv. Wairau {{were recorded in}} a preliminary experiment. Subsequently, 7 high viability Pawera seed lots were used to explore the relationship between seed vigour, as measured in the laboratory, and seed performance, both {{in the field and}} in storage. Four vigour testing techniques i. e. conductivity, accelerated aging (AA), controlled deterioration (CD) and speed of germination were employed. Results for standard germination (SG) and each of the vigour tests were related to seed performance by correlation analysis. Field performance was monitored for 6 seed lots, sown at 8 dates through spring and autumn. Seed storability was determined by measuring the viability of 4 seed lots under 5 storage conditions (including ambient open storage and simulated temperate controlled storage: 20 °C, 45 % to 90 % RH) over a total of 11 months. The effects of mechanical damage, thousand seed weight, imbibition rate and storage fungi on seed viability and vigour were also investigated and seed quality changes during storage were monitored. The vigour rankings found in the laboratory were consistent with those for field emergence, emergence rate over the 8 sowings and performance during storage. Low vigour lots also showed a significant reduction in seedling dry weight for the autumn sowings when soil temperatures were very low. Each of the four vigour techniques were able to provide more accurate parameters for predicting seed performances than the SG test. For predicting seed field emergence over all the sowings, the best result was provided by the CD test at either 16 % or 18 % seed moisture content (r = 0. 933 and 0. 911 resp.), followed by AA (2 -day AA of surface sterilized seed) (r = 0. 840) and conductivity (r = - 0. 602). For predicting seed storability, the best result was obtained from the CD test (at either 18 % or 20 % seed moisture content) for ambient storage conditions, and from both CD (either 18 % or 20 % seed moisture content) and AA (3 -day aging) under controlled storage conditions. Correlation coefficients for vigour tests and storage performance tended to vary between storage periods. Seeds which imbibed water rapidly (within 4 h) were low in viability and vigour, but this was generally related to the extent of mechanical damage to the seed coat. Seed weight was not related to seed vigour. Seed deterioration during storage was associated with increasing conductivity, abnormal seedlings and <b>dead</b> <b>seed</b> content, and decreasing germination rate, normal seedlings, and field emergence. Vigour was lost before viability. The deterioration rate was quicker at high RH (75 and 90 % RH), since the seeds were quickly invaded by storage fungi. The present experimental results strongly suggest that standard germination was a poor predictor of seed performance, both in the field and during storage. Both accelerated aging and controlled deterioration seem promising techniques for determining vigour of red clover seed lots. The further development of these vigour tests is discussed...|$|E

40|$|High {{temperature}} and high relative humidity adversely affect {{the quality of}} seeds, and are features of tropical climate. Seed drying and storage are being used increasingly in developing countries to improve seed storage and quality. This study was undertaken to evaluate a range of seed drying methods and storage conditions with the view to selecting an appropriate method(s) for use in tropical countries. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds at three initial seed moisture content (m. c.) of 23. 8, 18. 0 and 14. 5 % were dried to 10 % seed m. c. before storage. The performances of four different drying methods: artificial dryer (Kiwi Mini) set at 30 °C or 45 °C, natural sun drying, and in-bin natural ventilation drying were evaluated. Natural sun drying, and in-bin natural ventilation drying were conducted from March to May, 1997, when mean {{temperature and}} relative humidity during sunny days were 17 °C and 60 % respectively. The dried seeds were stored under two conditions: open storage at 20. 5 ° 0 and 55 % relative humidity (r. h.), and closed storage at 25 °C and 90 % r. h. for 20, 40, and 60 days. Time and energy consumed for drying by the different methods were determined to compare the drying efficiency when combined with quality of the seed. Deterioration of the seed due to storage conditions and drying methods used was determined by assessing their effects on seed germination, abnormal seedlings, <b>dead</b> <b>seed,</b> hollow heart percentages, and conductivity. Seed samples dried by the Kiwi Mini dryer set at 45 °C took 7 hours and those set at 30 °C took 17 hours. It took 54 hours with natural in-bin ventilation drying, while sun drying took 37 hours. However, energy consumed when drying seeds at 30 °C was 17 kWh, which was more than twice that at 45 °C. Seed germination was not significantly different between drying methods, but averaged only 75 % because of sprouting damage of the crop prior to harvest. Germinations after open and closed storage for 20 days did not differ, although some differences appeared after 40 days of storage. However, open and closed storage for 60 days significantly reduced seed germination to 54 and 33 % respectively. Because seeds are heat-sensitive, drying air temperature and drying rate are particularly important to avoid internal seed breakage, cracking and splitting, fungal growth, and loss of germination and vigour. Selected studies have shown that seed can be dried at high temperature for a short time, followed by tempering to re-distribute moisture and temperature inside the seed, thus reducing the percentage of cracking. Thus, a second experiment was conducted with maize (Zea mays L) to study the impact on seed viability of high temperature drying followed by tempering. Maize at 28. 5 % initial seed m. c. was dried at 60 °C for short periods of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 minutes, followed by tempering for 45 minutes at either 30 °C or 21 °C. This cycle was repeated until maize seeds were dried to 13. 0 % m. c [...] The percentage of cracked seeds, germination immediately after drying, and after an accelerated ageing test, did not differ between 30 °C and 21 °C tempering. Drying exposure times of up to 10 minutes per cycle at 60 °C caused vertical cracks in up to 50 % of seeds, but seed germination remained over 90 % and seed vigour was also maintained. The percentage of seeds with stress cracks due to high temperature drying (5 - 25 minute cycles) at 60 °C followed by tempering had polynomial relationships with seed germination and vigour. Seeds dried at the same temperature without tempering had their germination reduced from 99 to 20 %...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} this {{research}} project was initiated, the Tasmanian pyrethrum industry was attempting to establish crops by sowing rather than by planting of 'splits' or seedling plugs. This thesis investigated plant density and sowing times required for maximum yield. Studies were also conducted to improve chances for successful crop establishment from seed. That work investigated environmental requirements for germination and aspects of seed quality and seed production. Previous {{studies have examined the}} influence of density on yield of pyrethrins, but none had been conducted in sown trials, in cool temperate environments, over a wide range of plant densities. Furthermore, the influence of plant density on components of yield had not been intensively investigated. This work identified that maximum yield was achieved in the first season at between 16 and 39 plants/m 2 and at or above 16 plants/m 2 in the second season following establishment. Yield was a function of dry flower yield rather than due to change in percentage of pyrethrins in the flowers. Higher flower yield was associated with greater above- ground dry matter production. The yield component which increased with plant density was number of flowering tillers/m 2. Yield components decreasing with density included number of flowering tillers/plant, flowers/tiller and dry weight/flower. Other aspects of changing plant morphology and development with density investigated included, crop height, mean flower maturity and plant survival. The recommendation to industry was to aim for a plant population of above 16 and below 39 plants/m 2. Yields achieved in this work were unprecedented in the pyrethrum agronomy literature. No reported studies have examined the influence of time of sowing on pyrethrins yield. Field studies showed that sowings later than mid-November led to significant reductions in yield in the first flower harvest. Yield reductions were associated with decreased dry matter production/plant and flowering tillers/plant. Later sowings resulted in plants failing to flower or in significant reductions in the extent of flowering. Sowing earlier than mid-November resulted in no significant increases in yield. As pyrethrum crops have not been traditionally established by sowing, only scant information was available on requirements for germination, or seed quality. A field study and three laboratory trials investigated the influence of temperature and seed quality on germination and emergence. Results demonstrated that rate and final emergence varied significantly at different times of year. In general, the proportion of viable seed sown that emerged and survived was very low. Both rate of emergence and final emergence percentage were associated with temperature. Laboratory investigation of germination percentage, rate and uniformity of germination of a seed lot under a range of constant temperatures confirmed the previously reported findings relating to germination characteristics of this temperate species. Unexpected though was the high proportion of <b>dead</b> <b>seed</b> found at temperatures only several degrees higher than the temperature for optimal germination rate. Six seed lots were subsequently germinated at low, medium and high temperatures which provided some insight into the seed death phenomenon as well as documenting the range of behaviours from different seed lots. An explanation for differences in germination behaviour involving seed maturity was proposed for different seed lots and this was tested in a subsequent study. Finally, the effects of an 18 month storage period on the germination characteristics seed lots was investigated in a laboratory trial. There was little change in most germination parameters except for time to complete germination which increased in all seed lots after storage and uniformity of germination which decreased. Changes were assumed to be due to satisfaction of an after ripening requirement. Laboratory studies investigated the influence of seed mass on various germination and seedling development characteristics. Variation in seed mass within seed lots was identified but this had little impact on rate of germination or other germination parameters. However, a following, study revealed that heavier seedlings emerged from seeds that germinated earliest within seed lots. Furthermore, heavier seedlings demonstrated faster development than did lighter seedlings. Although seedling mass was found to be associated with rate of germination within seed lots, this factor failed • to explain significant differences in mean time to germinate between seed lots. It was subsequently recommended to industry that cleaning on a size or mass basis could improve seed quality. The influence of harvest date on seed quality and quantity were investigated. Results indicated that losses of larger achenes from the harvested flowers were occurring with lateness of harvest. Characteristics of the seed including mean seed mass, proportion of viable seed in the sample, germination percentage and rate of germination were found to vary considerably with harvest date. Data generated in this work were found to be consistent with the model which proposed that variability in germination parameters was due largely due to maturity of seed at harvest. A following study revealed that relative position on the capitulum also had a profound influence on germination parameters of the seed.

Visually, 120 seeds were divided into three classes: yellow, grey and black seeds. Thereafter, images at 19 different wavelengths ranging from 375 – 970 nm were captured of all the seeds. Mean intensity for each single seed was extracted from the images, and a significant difference between the three colour classes was observed, with the best separation in the near-infrared wavelengths. A specified feature (RegionMSI mean) based on normalized canonical discriminant analysis, were employed and viable seeds were distinguished from <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> with 92 % accuracy. The same model was tested on a validation set of seeds. These seeds were divided into two groups depending on germination ability, 241 were predicted as viable and expected to germinate and 59 were predicted as <b>dead</b> or non-germinated <b>seeds.</b> This validation of the model resulted in 96 % correct classification of the seeds. The results illustrate how multispectral imaging technology can be employed for prediction of viable castor seeds, based on seed coat colour...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experiment}} two different lots of dill seeds (Anethum graveolens L.) : lot A - cv. 'Amat' and lot B - cv. 'Lukullus' were evaluated for their characters {{in terms of}} their quality. The seeds of the B lot had a lack of embryos caused by lygus bugs (Lygus ssp.), and as a consequence their germination capacity was lower and the number of seeds qualified in the germination test as healthy ungerminated was larger, in comparison with these seed characters of the A lot. Both lots were heavily colonized by fungi, but the percentage of <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> was higher in the B lot than in the A one. The seeds in the B lot were previously injured by lygus bugs...|$|R

40|$|The {{seed bank}} of Heracleum mantegazzianum, {{native to the}} western Caucasus and {{invasive}} in Europe, was studied in the Slavkovsky ́ les Protected Landscape Area, the Czech Republic, {{during the course of}} two growing seasons. In each of seven study sites with dominating stands of the species, soil samples were taken in October (after the fruit release), April (before germination) and June–July (before the fruit release). Ten samples were taken from each site using a soil hand bore, 4. 6 cm in diameter. Seeds elutriated from the samples were immediately germinated in labora-tory conditions (108 C, 12 h light/ 12 h dark); those that germinated during 1 month were considered as non-dormant. Non-germinated but viable seeds, tested for viability by tetrazolium, were considered as dormant. The number of <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> was also recorded. The total number of seeds significantly increased with mean density of flowering plants at a site. Of the total variation in seed-bank size, about four-fifths were attributed to that among sites, and one-fifth to that within sites. The number and proportion of living seeds differed significantly between years in summer, but not in autumn and spring. Total number and the numbers of dormant, non-dormant, living and <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> significantly differed among the autumn, spring and summer samples. The percentage of living seeds in the total seed bank decreased from 56 % in autumn to 42 % in spring to 15 % in summer. The percentage of non-dormant seeds among those living was 0. 3 % in autumn, it increased to 87. 5 % in the spring sample, and decreased to 3 % in summer. Pooled across all sites, the average seed numbers (expressed per m 2) were 6719 ^ 4119 (mean ^ SD) in autumn...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the ecology and {{taxonomy}} of the vegetation of Um Rimmitta area, White Nile State. Taxonomic studies included collection, preparation, identification and classification of plant species in the study area. In the present study (85) species were identified belonging to 30 families. Botanic names and synonyms have been updated. Brief descriptions of the collected specimens have been included. Medicinal and other uses have been given. Almost 49. 4 % of the species {{were found to have}} medicinal uses. Moreover, a check-list of endangered, extinct and famine food plants has been provided. Seven ecological parameters have been studied. These were density, abundance, frequency, diversity, association between species, dominance of woody species and site similarity. The total density of woody species in the study area was found to be 19. 3 stems/ha. It was also found that the density of trees and shrubs differed from one site to another according to topography. The density of Acacia tortilis subsp. spirocarpa was associated with high frequency and abundance. A positive association was observed between Acacia tortilis subsp. spirocarpa and A. tortilis subsp. raddiana. The soil seed bank was analyzed for the number of live and <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> at each of the three depths within the study area. The analysis revealed the following: The seed bank density was higher in the upper soil depths as compared to the lower levels. It was found that the seed density decreases with increasing depth. The live seed density ranged from 1015 – 5371 seeds/m 2, whereas the density of the <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> ranged from 3215 - 6957 seeds/m 2. The dominant plant species to which the live seeds belong were Schoenefeldia gracilis, Brachiaria spp., Dactyloctenium aegyptium and Aristida spp., whereas the dominant species to which the <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> belong were Panicum turgidum, Euphorbia aegyptiaca and Cyperus rotundus. The results of biomass and carrying capacity showed that there was a decline in the carrying capacity from 26 a. u. /km 2 /year to 3 a. u. /km 2 /yeary. The total biomass of the study area was found to be 33540. 5 kg/km 2. Natural regeneration of woody species at the study area was found to be 421 seedlings/ha. The dominant regenerating species was Acacia tortilis subsp. spirocarpa. The average canopy cover/m 2 was determined {{for each of the three}} sites in the study area and it was found to be 1062 m 2 /ha. Accordingly, the study area was classified by FAO (2000) as other wooded land. The present study revealed that the soil moisture content was relatively low at the study area. The chemical analysis of the soil revealed that there were no significant differences between the three sites in the study area, with respect to soil elements. However, there were significant differences between the three sites in their pH values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The X-ray test is a simple, fast, non-destructive, {{and highly}} precise test that enables {{detailed}} examination of internal seed morphology and identification of seed damage and its location and type. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate the efficiency of the X-ray test and the relationship between the structure of Crotalaria juncea seeds and germination. Six lots of Crotalaria juncea seeds of the IAC-KR 1 cultivar were subjected to X-ray and germination tests. Normal and abnormal seedlings and <b>dead</b> <b>seeds</b> were photographed and analyzed together with the X-ray images of the seeds. Results showed that analysis of X-ray images is effective in identifying mechanical damage, stink bug damage, and deteriorated tissues in Crotalaria juncea seeds and is able to establish an association between their occurrence and germination...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} method with a wider applicability to isolate plant mitochondria for mtDNA extraction Zaheer Ahmed and Yong‑Bi Fu* Background: Mitochondria {{perform a}} principal role in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in mtDNA can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and are frequently associated with various abnormalities during plant development. Extraction of plant mitochondria and mtDNA {{is the basic}} requirement for the characterization of mtDNA mutations and other molecular studies. However, currently available methods for mitochondria isolation are either tissue specific or species specific. Extracted mtDNA may contain substantial chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) and its end use effi‑ ciency can be reduced. Clearly, an effective mitochondria isolation method is warranted with wider applicability and with minimum contamination from cpDNA and nDNA. Results: Here we reported an improved method for isolating mitochondria from dry wheat seeds and its extension to <b>dead</b> <b>seeds,</b> viable seeds, etiolated leaf tissue and several other plant species: oat, Arabidopsis, flax, and yellow mustard. The isolated mitochondria were successfully used to extract mtDNA with QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). The extracted mtDNA from the assayed samples of these species was intact in large quantity and showed little contami‑ nation from nDNA, cpDNA, RNA, and proteins. The mtDNA extracted from <b>dead</b> wheat <b>seeds</b> was also substantial, but more degraded and less intact when compared to those from viable seeds and other tissues. Conclusion: The improved method was successfully applied to isolate mitochondria and extract mtDNA from several different tissues and plant species. The major advance in the improvement lies in its wider application with the same mitochondria extraction medium to different tissues and species. The improvement is significant, as it helps to widen the scope of future plant mitochondria research...|$|R
40|$|The {{germination}} of {{viable seeds}} {{is the basis}} for new plant growth and development. Seeds lose viability during storage, but the biochemical mechanisms of seed death are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate degradation patterns of nucleic acids during seed ageing and subsequent water uptake. Seeds of Pisum sativum L. were artificially aged at 50 C and 12 % seed water content (WC). Nucleic acids degradation was studied during ageing and during imbibition of four seed lots with differential viability from highly viable to <b>dead.</b> As <b>seeds</b> lost viability during ageing, DNA was gradually degraded into internucleosomal fragments, resulting in DNA laddering, in conjunction with disintegration of 18 S and 28 S rRNA bands. During imbibition, non-aged controls had high levels of DNA and RNA integrity through to radicle protrusion. In an aged seed lot with 85 % total germination (TG) DNA fragmentation decreased upon imbibition probably due to nucleosome degradation, while rRNA integrity did not improve. In an aged seed lot with 44 % TG, neither DNA nor rRNA integrity improved upon imbibition. <b>Dead</b> <b>seeds</b> showed DNA degradation as laddering throughout imbibition along with extensive degradation of rRNA. We present a model in which interlinked programmed and non-programmed events contribute to seed ageing, and suggest that protection of nucleic acids during ageing is key to seed longevity...|$|R
40|$|Agronomy of Azul (UNCPBA) {{began in}} 1998, within the {{research}} project "Bases for the genetic improvement of Lotus", {{a series of}} activities starting from which a tetraploid population (2 n= 4 x= 24) was obtained by using colchicine on diploid seedlings (2 n= 2 x= 12) of L. glaber Mill. (Barufaldi et al., 1999; Barufaldi et al., 2000). The present work compared some characteristics related to seed quality and pollen fertility in a tetraploid population and in the diploid variety named Chajá Tresur. The 1000 -seed weight {{and the percentage of}} fertile pollen grains, seed germination, hard <b>seeds,</b> <b>dead</b> <b>seeds,</b> fresh seeds and abnormal seedlings were evaluated in both cytotypes. In January 2001, 22 plants of Chajá Tresur and 49 of the tetraploid population were selected for study. Two inflorescences per plant were picked at random and two flowers per inflorescence were utilised to measure pollen fertility. Pollen grains were stained according to the technique of Alexander (1980) and at least 200 pollen grains per flower were examined. For the determination of 1000 -seed weight, four samples of seeds were taken in each cytotype and underwent pre-refrigeration and mechanical scarification.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis {{was carried out}} of published methods to assess seed viability using 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) based assays of seed batches. The tests were carried out on seeds of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Optic) as a model. We established that 10 % [w/v] trichloroacetic acid (TCA) /methanol is superior to the acetone and methanol-only based methods: allowing the highest recovery of formazan and the lowest background optical density (OD) readings, across seed lots comprising different ratios of viable and <b>dead</b> <b>seeds.</b> The method allowed a linear-model to accurately capture the statistically significant relationship between the quantity of formazan that could be extracted using the method we developed and the seed temperature-response, and seed viability {{as a function of}} artificially aged seed lots. Other quality control steps are defined to help ensure the assay is robust and these are reported in a Standard Operating Procedure...|$|R
