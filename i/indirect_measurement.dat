5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an <b>indirect</b> <b>measurement</b> of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An <b>indirect</b> <b>measurement</b> was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E

25|$|A severe ADAMTS13 {{deficiency}} below 5% or <10% of {{the normal}} (depending on the definitions) is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity assays {{are based on the}} direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>measurement</b> of VWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity. If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS). The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore an onetime negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP. A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing an USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{measurement}} study analyzing DDoS attacks from multiple data sources, relying on both direct measurements of flow-level information, and more traditional <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements</b> using backscatter analysis. Understanding {{the nature of}} DDoS attacks is critically important {{to the development of}} effective counter measures to this pressing problem. While much of the community’s current understanding of DDoS attacks result from <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements,</b> our analysis suggests that such studies do not give a comprehensive view of DDoS attacks witnessed in today’s Internet. Specifically, our results suggest little use of address spoofing by attackers, which imply that such attacks will be invisible to <b>indirect</b> backscatter <b>measurement</b> techniques. Further, at the detailed packet-level characterization (e. g., attack destination ports), there are significant differences between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements.</b> Thus, there is tremendous value in moving towards direct observations to better understand DDoS attacks. Direct measurements additionally provide information inaccessible to <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements,</b> enabling us to better understand how to defend against attacks. We find that for 70 % of the attacks fewer than 50 source ASes are involved and {{a relatively small number of}} ASes produce nearly 72 % of the total attack volume. This suggests that network providers can reduce a substantial volume of malicious traffic with targeted deployment of DDoS defenses. I...|$|R

60|$|There {{are also}} {{two or three}} of the {{principal}} laws of space or extension which are unusually fitted for rendering one position or magnitude a mark of another, and thereby contributing to render the science largely deductive. First, the magnitudes of inclosed spaces, whether superficial or solid, are completely determined by the magnitudes of the lines and angles which bound them. Secondly, the length of any line, whether straight or curve, is measured (certain other things being given) by the angle which it subtends, and vicè versa. Lastly, the angle which any two straight lines make with each other at an inaccessible point, is measured by the angles they severally make with any third line we choose to select. By means of these general laws, the measurement of all lines, angles, and spaces whatsoever might be accomplished by measuring a single straight line and a sufficient number of angles; which is the plan actually pursued in the trigonometrical survey of a country; and fortunate it is that this is practicable, the exact measurement of long straight lines being always difficult, and often impossible, but that of angles very easy. Three such generalizations as the foregoing afford such facilities for the <b>indirect</b> <b>measurement</b> of magnitudes (by supplying us with known lines or angles which are marks of the magnitude of unknown ones, and thereby of the spaces which they inclose), that it is easily intelligible how from a few data we can go on to ascertain the magnitude of an indefinite multitude of lines, angles, and spaces, which we could not easily, or could not at all, measure by any more direct process.|$|E

40|$|In {{peer-to-peer}} networks, application relays {{have been}} {{commonly used to}} provide various networking services. The service performance often improves significantly if a relay is selected appropriately based on its network location. In this paper, we studied the location-aware relay discovery and selection problem for large-scale P 2 P streaming networks. In these large-scale and dynamic overlays, it incurs significant communication and computation cost to discover a sufficiently large relay candidate set and further to select one relay with good performance. The network location can be measured directly or indirectly with the tradeoffs between timeliness, overhead and accuracy. Based on a measurement study and the associated error analysis, we demonstrate that <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as King and Internet Coordinate Systems (ICS), can only achieve a coarse estimation of peers' network location and those methods based on pure <b>indirect</b> <b>measurements</b> cannot lead to a good relay selection. We also demonstrate that there exists significant error amplification of the commonly used "best-out-of-K" selection methodology using three RTT data sets publicly available. We propose a two-phase approach to achieve efficient relay discovery and accurate relay selection. <b>Indirect</b> <b>measurements</b> are used to narrow down {{a small number of}} high-quality relay candidates and the final relay selection is refined based on direct probing.
