50|$|IP {{receptor}} agonists are front-line {{drugs to}} treat pulmonary hypertension. Major drugs {{in this category}} include PGI2 itself (i.e. <b>epoprostenol),</b> iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost with <b>epoprostenol</b> being favored in some studies. However, newly developed IP agonists with favorable pharmacological features such as Selexipag have been granted by the US FDA Orphan Drug status {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. IP agonists are also to treat severe vasoconstriction in Raynaud's disease, Raynaud's disease-like syndromes, and scleroderma. <b>Epoprostenol</b> causes improvements in hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation in patients suffering the acute respiratory distress syndrome but due to the limited number of randomized clinical trials and lack of studies investigating mortality, its use cannot be recommended as standard of care for this disease and should be reserved for those refractory to traditional therapies. A meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials on the use of prostanoids including prinicpally IP receptor agonists on patients with sever lower limb peripheral artery disease due to diverse causes found that these drugs may reduce the extent of limb tissue that needed to be amputated. However, the studies did not support extensive use of prostanoids in patients with critical limb ischemia as an adjunct to revascularization or as an alternative to major amputation in cases which cannot undergo revascularization.|$|E

50|$|The Prostacyclin {{receptor}} , also {{termed the}} prostaglandin I2 receptor or just IP, is a receptor {{belonging to the}} prostaglandin (PG) group of receptors.

50|$|High dose {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} {{are useful in}} only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose mean pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, <b>epoprostenol,</b> or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive. Of these, {{only half of the}} patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.|$|E
50|$|Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is {{commonly}} {{considered the most}} effective treatment for PAH. <b>Epoprostenol</b> (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore {{has to be kept}} on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether <b>epoprostenol</b> (prostacyclin, PGI 2) or heart-lung transplantation (HLT), or both improves survival {{of patients with}} severe pulmonary hypertension. DESIGN [...] This was a prospective study where the effects of <b>epoprostenol</b> were compared with conventional treatment. Also, the benefits of <b>epoprostenol</b> and HLT were assessed by comparing survival in this group with that of 120 patients at the Mayo Clinic before HLT and <b>epoprostenol</b> treatment became available. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS [...] Forty four patients were studied; 25 received continuous <b>epoprostenol</b> over a four year period (mean (SD) cardiac index 1. 8 (0. 4) 1 min- 1 m- 2 and mean (SD) pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 70 (16) mm Hg) and 19 did not (cardiac index 2. 1 (0. 6) 1 min- 1 m- 2 and PAP 64 (13) mm Hg). Ten patients underwent HLT: seven had received <b>epoprostenol,</b> and three had not. RESULTS [...] The therapeutic intervention with <b>epoprostenol,</b> or HLT, or both improved survival compared with the Mayo clinic patients (p = 0. 05). Most of the benefit was conferred by <b>epoprostenol,</b> which prolonged survival twofold from a median time of eight to 17 months and doubled the changes of successful HLT.

40|$|BACKGROUNDâContinuous {{intravenous}} {{treatment with}} <b>epoprostenol</b> significantly improves pulmonary haemodynamics and survival {{in patients with}} primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Its beneficial effect, however, may be blunted due to adverse effects such as catheter sepsis and systemic hypotension. Recent investigations have shown that inhaled iloprost is effective {{in the treatment of}} PPH. Based on their different pharmacokinetics, we hypothesised that the combination of intravenous <b>epoprostenol</b> and inhaled iloprost would be more efficacious than <b>epoprostenol</b> alone during acute testing in patients with PPH. â¨METHODSâThe effect of a single dose of inhaled iloprost (30 Âµg total over 15 minutes) on pulmonary haemodynamics was examined in eight patients with PPH (initial non-responders to nitric oxide) who had considerable adverse effects during treatment with <b>epoprostenol.</b> â¨RESULTSâThe combination of inhaled iloprost and intravenous <b>epoprostenol</b> significantly improved mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac index (CI), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2), and systemic arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2) compared with <b>epoprostenol</b> treatment alone. Mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) remained unchanged. â¨CONCLUSIONSâThe pulmonary vasoreactivity shown by additional iloprost inhalation during effective <b>epoprostenol</b> treatment suggests that an improvement of treatment for pulmonary hypertension may be possible by combining vasoactive substances. ...|$|E

The potency of 9 beta-methyl carbacyclin relative to <b>epoprostenol</b> was comparable in ADP and collagen-aggregated platelet rich plasma (PRP), 9 beta-methyl carbacyclin being 0. 01 times as active as <b>epoprostenol.</b> The anti-aggregatory potencies of the two compounds were comparable in PRP and whole blood. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methyl xanthine enhanced the anti-aggregatory activity of both compounds in vitro. 9 beta-methyl carbacyclin and <b>epoprostenol</b> elevated platelet cyclic AMP, 9 beta-methyl carbacyclin being 0. 04 times as active as <b>epoprostenol.</b> In a placebo controlled trial both drugs produces significant headache and facial flushing when compared with placebo.

40|$|Because <b>epoprostenol</b> (prostacyclin) is a {{prostaglandin}} {{that causes}} vasodilatation and inhibits platelet function {{it may be}} of benefit during coronary artery angioplasty. The safety and capacity of intracoronary <b>epoprostenol</b> to dilate coronary arteries were assessed in 16 patients undergoing routine coronary angiography. The view that best displayed the left epicardial coronary arteries was selected as a control for each patient. Intracoronary <b>epoprostenol</b> was then given and the angiogram was repeated in the chosen view. The procedure was repeated twice: once with a higher dose of <b>epoprostenol</b> and once after intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Angiograms were coded and analysed by an observer who {{was unaware of the}} treatment. The calibre of the arteries was measured from traced projections of the angiograms. The blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram were recorded throughout. The first two patients were given <b>epoprostenol</b> infusions of 2. 5 and 5. 0 ng/kg per minute to assess safety, and there were no untoward reactions. The next ten patients had <b>epoprostenol</b> infusions of 5. 0 and 7. 5 ng/kg per minute followed by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. No haemodynamic disturbances occurred and coronary luminal calibre did not change with <b>epoprostenol</b> (mean (SD) luminal diameter: 2. 85 (0. 62) mm control, 2. 80 (0. 61) mm at 5. 0 ng/kg, and 2. 80 (0. 54) mm at 7. 5 ng/kg), but it did increase significantly with isosorbide dinitrate (to 3. 17 (0. 36) mm). The last four patients had <b>epoprostenol</b> infusions of 7. 5 and 10 ng/kg followed by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and two of them became hypotensive (one after <b>epoprostenol</b> and one after isosorbide dinitrate).

Eight patients developed tall T waves on the electrocardiogram during <b>epoprostenol</b> infusion but none had arrhythmias. The results indicate that clinically tolerable doses of intracoronary <b>epoprostenol</b> do not significantly dilate the epicardial coronary arteries.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTransition from {{intravenous}} (IV) <b>epoprostenol</b> to IV treprostinil {{in patients}} with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has traditionally been performed by gradually decreasing the <b>epoprostenol</b> dose while increasing the treprostinil dose. Preliminary data suggest that this transition can be performed more rapidly {{without the need for}} <b>epoprostenol</b> weaning. We conducted a single center, prospective clinical trial to assess the safety, efficacy, and treatment satisfaction of rapidly switching from <b>epoprostenol</b> to IV treprostinil. MethodsThis study included patients with PH who had rapidly transitioned from <b>epoprostenol</b> to IV treprostinil. Data collected included clinical status, adverse events, PH symptoms, and previously validated measures of quality of life and treatment satisfaction. ResultsTen patients were enrolled in this study. Exercise capacity measured by mean 6 -min walk distance was maintained from baseline throughout follow-up. Severity of disease as assessed by WHO functional class was maintained or improved for the majority of patients. Adverse events were minimal during the transition, and all patients remained on IV treprostinil throughout the follow-up period. A favorable impact on quality of life and treatment satisfaction measures was observed by eight weeks following the transition from <b>epoprostenol</b> to IV treprostinil. Specifically, time spent on drug preparation activities decreased by 39. 5 % with treprostinil compared to <b>epoprostenol.</b> ConclusionsRapidly switching from <b>epoprostenol</b> to IV treprostinil can be achieved without safety concerns, with minimal patient monitoring and without the need for extended hospitalization, while favorably impacting on patients' quality of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{endogenous}} prostacyclin (PGI 2) is depressed {{in patients with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

40|$|Intravenous {{infusion}} (IVI) of <b>epoprostenol</b> is {{an effective}} treatment for patients with advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, there is no widely accepted standard method for initiating the IVI therapy. This study evaluated the hemodynamic improvements achieved with IVI <b>epoprostenol</b> to determine the optimal protocol for treatment initiation. We retrospectively analyzed 42 consecutive PAH patients who underwent IVI <b>epoprostenol</b> in Keio University Hospital from 2001 to 2013. The study group comprised 30 women {{with a mean age}} of 34. 3 Â± 1. 9 years. The etiology of PAH was idiopathic or heritable PAH (I/HPAH) in 38 cases, PAH associated with connective tissue disease in 3, and Eissenmenger's syndrome in the remaining case. We divided the patients into rapid- and slow-initiation therapy groups according to the cumulative <b>epoprostenol</b> dose administered during the first 180 days, and compared the hemodynamic changes between the groups. The median cumulative doses were 6142 Â± 165 Î¼g/kg and 3998 Â± 132 Î¼g/kg <b>epoprostenol,</b> respectively. While there were no significant differences in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), or cardiac index (CI) between the groups before the IVI <b>epoprostenol</b> therapy, the rapid-initiation therapy group achieved significant improvements in these hemodynamic data compared with the slow-initiation therapy group (P < 0. 005) at the follow-up right-heart catheterization (RHC).

It was hypothesised that this element of the elevated vascular resistance may be responsive to continuous intravenous <b>epoprostenol</b> therapy. Retrospectively, the clinical and haemodynamic responses to continuous intravenous <b>epoprostenol</b> were evaluated in nine CTEPH patients who subsequently underwent pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). Cardiopulmonary haemodyamics were determined prior to the initiation of <b>epoprostenol,</b> while on <b>epoprostenol,</b> prior to PTE, and after PTE. Six patients, treated for 2 - 26 months prior to PTE, experienced either clinical stability or improvement that was associated with a mean reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 28 % (median 33 %,,, range 0 - 46 %). Three patients, treated for 3 - 9 months, experienced clinical deterioration during <b>epoprostenol</b> administration, with a significant increase in PVR in two patients. Subsequent PTE resulted in a highly significant improvement of cardiac index, mean pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance. To conclude, selected patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension may benefit clinically and haemodynamically from continuous intravenous <b>epoprostenol</b> treatment prior to pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Factors predictive of a beneficial response, and whether this intervention influences either morbidity or mortality associated with pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, remain to be establishe...|$|E
40|$|In 60 {{randomized}} dogs {{the effects}} of <b>epoprostenol</b> infusion (100 ng/kg/min) on ischemia-induced premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular flutters and ventricular fibrillation were studied. The circumflex coronary artery occlusion canine model of sudden death was used. The results demonstrate different effects of <b>epoprostenol</b> on ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias: 1) both postischemic (7 of 30 vs 15 of 30, p = 0. 0298) and postreperfusion (5 of 23 vs 8 of 15, p = 0. 0492) ventricular fibrillations were prevented in <b>epoprostenol</b> dogs with an improvement of the global survival rate (18 of 30 vs 7 of 30, p = 0. 0019) as compared to controls; 2) in <b>epoprostenol</b> treated dogs a significantly increased incidence of non lethal arrhythmias-including ventricular flutters that occurred in 12 of 30 dogs vs 4 of 30 in controls (p = 0. 0195) [...] was observed; 3) {{a positive correlation between}} the percent diastolic pressure fall 10 min after the start of <b>epoprostenol</b> infusion and the number of non lethal arrhythmias was noted. However, hemodynamic effects of the compound, suggesting an oxygen sparing action, did not preclude the antifibrillatory effectiveness. Thus, the antifibrillatory and antiarrhythmic effects of <b>epoprostenol</b> after circumflex coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in dogs seem independent from one another...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of inhaled <b>epoprostenol</b> for treatment of acute pulmonary hypertension (PH) in pediatric patients and to formulate a plan for a prospective, randomized study of pulmonary vasodilator therapy in this population. Inhaled <b>epoprostenol</b> is an effective treatment for pediatric PH. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all pediatric patients who received inhaled <b>epoprostenol</b> at a tertiary care hospital between October 2005 and August 2007. The study population was restricted to all patients under 18 years of age who received inhaled <b>epoprostenol</b> for greater than 1 hour and had available data for oxygenation index (OI) calculation. Arterial blood gas values and ventilator settings were collected immediately prior to <b>epoprostenol</b> initiation, and during <b>epoprostenol</b> therapy (as close to 12 hours after initiation as possible). Echocardiograms were reviewed during two time frames: Within 48 hours prior to therapy initiation and within 96 hours after initiation. Of the 20 patients in the study population, 13 were neonates, and the mean OI for these patients improved during <b>epoprostenol</b> administration (mean OI before and during therapy was 25. 6 Â± 16. 3 and 14. 5 Â± 13. 6, respectively, P= 0. 02). Mean OI for the seven patients greater than 30 days of age was not significantly different during treatment (mean OI before and during therapy was 29. 6 Â± 15. 0 and 25. 6 Â± 17. 8, P= 0. 56). Improvement in echocardiographic findings (evidence of decreased right-sided pressures or improved right ventricular function) was demonstrated in 20 % of all patients. Inhaled <b>epoprostenol</b> is an effective therapy for the treatment of selected pediatric patients with acute PH. Neonates may benefit more consistently from this therapy than older infants and children. A randomized controlled trial is needed to discern the optimal role for inhaled prostanoids in the treatment of acute PH in childhood...|$|E
