60|$|August 27.--I made a more {{extended}} circuit in the vale with Brother Michel. We were {{mounted on}} a pair of sober nags, suitable to these rude paths; the weather was exquisite, and the company in which I found myself no less agreeable than the scenes through which I passed. We mounted at first by a steep grade along the summit of one of those twisted spurs that, from a <b>distance,</b> <b>mark</b> out provinces of sun and shade upon the mountain-side. The ground fell away on either hand with an extreme declivity. From either hand, out of profound ravines, mounted the song of falling water and the smoke of household fires. Here and there the hills of foliage would divide, and our eye would plunge down upon one of these deep- nested habitations. And still, high in front, arose the precipitous barrier of the mountain, greened over where it seemed that scarce a harebell could find root, barred with the zigzags of a human road where it seemed that not a goat could scramble. And in truth, for all the labour that it cost, the road is regarded even by the Marquesans as impassable; they will not risk a horse on that ascent; and those who lie to the westward come and go in their canoes. I never knew a hill to lose so little on a near approach: a consequence, I must suppose, of its surprising steepness. When we turned about, I was amazed to behold so deep a view behind, and so high a shoulder of blue sea, crowned by the whale-like island of Motane. And yet the wall of mountain had not visibly dwindled, and I could even have fancied, as I raised my eyes to measure it, that it loomed higher than before.|$|E

5000|$|Rangefinders allow {{a golfer}} to measure exact {{distance}} to the hole from their current position; they are illegal according to Rule 14-3 {{of the rules of}} golf, but the USGA allows individual course clubs to institute a local rule permitting rangefinders, and they are common among recreational golfers. The typical rangefinder is an optical device that is aimed by sighting the scope on the flag and using the calibrated gauge in the optics to estimate the distance based on the flagstick's apparent height. Other rangefinders estimate range using a calibrated focus or parallax control; the user sights the target, brings it into focus, and reads the <b>distance</b> <b>mark</b> on the control. Newer laser rangefinders operate by simply sighting any target and pressing a switch to take a very precise distance reading using an invisible laser. Newer golf carts often include GPS tracking which, combined with an electronic map of the course, can serve a similar function.|$|E

30|$|In the {{earthquake}} early warning (EEW) system, the epicenter location {{and magnitude of}} earthquakes are estimated using the amplitude growth rate of initial P-waves. It has been empirically {{pointed out that the}} growth rate becomes smaller as epicentral distance becomes far regardless of the magnitude of earthquakes. So, the epicentral distance can be estimated from the growth rate using this empirical relationship. However, the growth rates calculated from different earthquakes at the same epicentral <b>distance</b> <b>mark</b> considerably different values from each other. Sometimes the growth rates of earthquakes having the same epicentral distance vary by 104 times. Qualitatively, it has been considered that the gap in the growth rates is due to differences in the local heterogeneities that the P-waves propagate through. In this study, we demonstrate theoretically how local heterogeneities in the subsurface disturb the relationship between the growth rate and the epicentral distance. Firstly, we calculate seismic scattered waves in a heterogeneous medium. First-ordered PP, PS, SP, and SS scatterings are considered. The correlation distance of the heterogeneities and fractional fluctuation of elastic parameters control the heterogeneous conditions for the calculation. From the synthesized waves, the growth rate of the initial P-wave is obtained. As a result, we find that a parameter (in this study, correlation distance) controlling heterogeneities {{plays a key role in}} the magnitude of the fluctuation of the growth rate. Then, we calculate the regional correlation distances in Japan that can account for the fluctuation of the growth rate of real earthquakes from 1997 to 2011 observed by K-NET and KiK-net. As a result, the spatial distribution of the correlation distance shows locality. So, it is revealed that the growth rates fluctuate according to the locality. When this local fluctuation is taken into account, the accuracy of the estimation of epicentral distances from initial P-waves can improve, which will in turn improve the accuracy of the EEW system.|$|E
40|$|Among senile {{diseases}} {{in the field}} of urology, establishment of differential diagnostic means between benign and malignant prostatic tumors was evaluated by application of ultrasonic A-scope method, The apparatus used in the study was SSD- 2 B model A-scope indication manufactured by Japan Radio Co, with a transducer which was specifically designed for diagnosis of prostatic diseases, Using three kinds of special transducers, 5 MC and 10 mm¢ for transrecta 1 method, 5 MC and 3 mm¢ for transurethral method and 5 MC and 10 mm¢ of P. PJ. form designed by Takahashi for prostatic use, experiments were carried out on its basic and clinical applications. 1) The most appropriate scanning condition of the apparatus was searched in order to differentiate malignant prostatic tumors from benign tumors. The main conditions, such as at 100 V for power, 10 ≒ 75 dB for gain and 10 for rejection, were fixed and then the marker was settled so as to shows about 7. 7 µs per time mark at about 130 KC of oscillating frequency of <b>distance</b> <b>mark</b> on the Brown tube surface (by the preliminary study one <b>distance</b> <b>mark</b> on the Brown tube surface was settled to correspond about 1 cm distance of the test piece). The pulse L 'was set on 1. 0 or 2. 0 for transrecta 1 method and 0 or 1. 0 for transurethral method, and ultrasonic diagnosis was made by analysis of the observed echo-patterns and the representative patterns were drawn. 2) For the basic experiments, operatively extripated prostatic tumor specimens, including 7 hypertrophy and 1 cancer confirmed by histological examination, were provided. i) Echo-pattern of prostatic hypertrophy: The height of the echo showed (÷) to (+) levels of my own classification and the echo itself revealed a tendency of single-peaked and solitary simple pattern. ii) Echo-pattern of prostatic cancer: The height of the echo showed (x) to () levels of my own classification and the echo itself revealed a tendency of multiple-peaked and fused irregular pattern. 3) For clinical experiments, a total of 63 cases was provided including 19 subjects with normal prostate, 6 patients with prostatic stone and 38 with prostatic tumors (in histologically, 21 with hypertrophy, 13 with cancer or suspected cancer and 4 with others), all of which diagnosis was established by urological examinations. i) In normal prostatic subjects, the thickness of the prostatic part from its rectal part to pubic part, determined by the observed values of the distance markes in 17 subjects, was 2. 7 ± 0. 4 marks as an average. ii) In 17 patients with prostatic hypertrophy, the average thickness of the prostatic part was 3. 9 ± 0. 5 marks, which was significantly different from that in normal subjects. The observed values in the patients with hypertrophy were worth in differentiating the enlarged thickness of the prostatic gland from normal. iii) No specific echo-pattern was observed in normal prostatic gland. The height of echo at the prostatic part was approximately in grade of (÷). iv) In patients with prostatic stone, the height of echo ranged (÷) to () levels with markedly sharp and single-peaked or 2 - to 3 -peaked echo-patterns. v) In patients with prostatic hypertrophy, the height of echo was () to (+) with single, double or tripple peaks, and the echo-pattern was not specific. vi) In patients with prostatic cancer, the height of echo was (+) to (), and showed multiple-peaked and fused irregular specific echo-pattern. 4) The comparative study 9 n analysis of echo-pattern at the prostatic part for ultrasonic diagnosis and histological diagnosis resulted as follows. i) Among 21 cases of prostatic hypertrophy diagnosed by histological examination 17 cases, 80. 9 %" agreed to the diagnosis made by ultrasonic method. ii) All of 15 cases who were diagnosed as prostatic cancer or possible prostatic cancer by histological examination concurred with the ultrasonic diagnosis. iii) In two patients who were suspected to have prostatic cancer but were not confirmed histologically due to unsuccessful biopsy, the ultrasonic examination revealed echo-patterns of cancer or possible cancer. iv) Out of 19 cases in which diagnosis of cancer or possible cancer of the prostatic gland was made by ultrasonic examination, histological study revealed prostatic hypertrophy in 4 cases, among which complication of cancer of the bladder neck was found in 1 case. 5) The ultrasonic diagnostic means of this kind gave neither direct nor indirect side effects to patients under study, not like prostatic biopsy or X-ray examination...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{portrayal}} of women in Mark's gospel {{in the context of}} his apocalyptic world-view. Each account that features women characters is interpreted in relation to Mark's definition of discipleship and his understanding of new creation. One of the key characteristics of Mark's portrayal of women is their association with the verb. Simon's mother-in-law serves Jesus {{at the beginning of the}} gospel (1 : 31), and the service of the women disciples is described for the first time at his crucifixion (15 : 41). In Mark's apocalyptic world-view the death of Jesus is a time of revelation. The service of the women disciples is mentioned at the crucifixion of Jesus because the true nature of discipleship can only be understood in the context of his service of giving his life to redeem humanity (10 : 45). Jesus initially calls twelve male disciples who represent the twelve tribes and foreshadow the restoration of Israel. At the crucifixion no member of the Twelve is present, whereas a Gentile centurion is the first human being to recognise Jesus as the Son of God (15 : 39), and the women are mentioned standing at a <b>distance.</b> <b>Mark</b> depicts the death of Jesus as the turning point between the old and the new age, and the religious and social barriers between men and women, and between Jews and Gentiles are broken. The male disciples, however, are not condemned, since the women are instructed to pass on the news of the resurrection to the disciples and Peter (16 : 7). Mark points forward to an inclusive community which consists of Jews and Gentiles, women and men. Mark associates women with service (1 : 29 - 31), anointing (14 : 3 - 9; 16 : 1 - 8) and the role of witnesses (15 : 40 - 41; 16 : 1 - 8). Women are thus aligned with Jesus' suffering and death. They are the last remaining disciples of Jesus, and the only witnesses to his death, burial and resurrection. At the end of the gospel, however, the women run away from the tomb, terrified to say anything to anyone (16 : 8). In Mark's apocalyptic world-view the fear of the women depicts the eschatological struggle between the old and the new age. Mark ends with the silence of the women, but also with the knowledge that the renewal of the discipleship group is dependent upon their witness and discipleship...|$|E
