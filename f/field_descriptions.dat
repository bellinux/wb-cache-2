50|$|Sediments {{can provide}} clues to reconstructing past natural and {{cultural}} processes {{in a similar manner}} as artifacts. Professionals that study geoarchaeology are trained to use changes in soils and geomorphology to interpret human behavior. By analyzing sediments, archaeologists can gather information regarding site chronology, supplement <b>field</b> <b>descriptions,</b> and test hypotheses related to site formation and function. Laboratories of sediments tend to focus on studying mineralogy, micromorphology, granulometry, pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate, and phosphorus levels. As with any material, specific methods used will depend on questions one is asking of the material. For example, both petrography and x-ray diffraction can be used to examine mineralogy, but the choice of method will depend on the specific minerals one aims to detect.|$|E
40|$|We derive Ward-Takahashi identities {{including}} composite {{fields in}} Abelian gauge theories and the matching condition between the elementary <b>field</b> <b>description</b> and the composite <b>field</b> <b>description.</b> With these we develop {{an approach to}} dynamical symmetry breaking in Abelian gauge theories including {{the study of the}} dynamically generated masses of the gauge boson, the fermions and the composite Higgs field.

5000|$|Lutite is old terminology, {{which is}} not widely used, by Earth {{scientists}} in <b>field</b> <b>descriptions</b> for fine-grained, sedimentary rocks, which are composed of silt-size sediment, clay-size sediment, or a mixture of both. When mixed with water lutites often disintegrate into mud. Because this is a field term, {{there is a lack}} of any precise definition for it based upon specific grain-size characteristics. Lutites include a variety of fine-grained sedimentary rocks, including calcisiltite, calcilutite, claystone, mudstone, shale, and siltstone. It is equivalent to the term mudstone and the Greek-derived term pelite. Lutite was first used in 1904 by Grabau, who derived it from the Latin word for mud. He also proposed a number of prefixes to be used with and attached to [...] "lutite" [...] in order to designated various types of lutites.

40|$|Atom-field {{entanglement}} {{is shown}} to {{play a crucial role}} for the onset of spatial self-organization of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice within a high-Q cavity. Like particles on a seesaw, the atoms feel a different potential depending on their spatial distribution. The system possesses two stable configurations, where all atoms occupy either only even or only odd lattice sites. While for a classical cavity <b>field</b> <b>description</b> a distribution balanced between even and odd sites is a stationary equilibrium state at zero temperature, the possibility of atom-field entanglement in a quantum <b>field</b> <b>description</b> yields an instant simultaneous decay of the homogeneous atomic cloud into an entangled superposition of the two stable atomic patterns correlated with different cavity fields.

40|$|We {{elucidate}} {{generally the}} interference of independent Bose fields {{in view of}} the conditional probability for the particle number measurements, and clarify its relation to the source number statistics. Despite lack of intrinsic phases, the interference phase can be inferred from the particle number registered at one detector by using the classical mean fields. If the conditional number distributions for the other detectors, given the outcome of the first detector, exhibit sufficiently narrow peaks around the values specified by the estimated phases, the mean <b>field</b> <b>description</b> is valid in a single run of interference. The widths in the conditional distribution are determined by the number statistics of the sources, among which notable scaling behavior is found depending on the detector configurations with the boundary at the Poissonian. The mean <b>field</b> <b>description</b> is found to be applicable to Poissonian and sub-Poissonian sources, whereas for super-Poissonian sources it is likely invalidated with the rather broad conditional distribution.
