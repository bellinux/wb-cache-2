5|$|Emperor Shengzong died in 1031, {{leaving behind}} {{instructions}} that named his son Yelü Zongzhen as heir. Yelü Zongzhen, known historically {{by the name}} Emperor Xingzong of Liao, became the Emperor of the Liao dynasty {{at the age of}} fifteen, and his reign immediately became plagued with courtly infighting. Emperor Xingzong's mother was a low-ranking consort, Nuou Jin, but he was raised by Emperor Shengzong's wife, Empress Ji Dian. Nuou Jin quickly moved to marginalize Ji Dian and <b>her</b> <b>supporters,</b> fabricating a coup and using it to justify exiling Ji Dian and executing most of <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> in several months of purges. Nuou Jin eventually sent assassins to kill Ji Dian; however, Ji Dian instead committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy {{made a new}} {{attempt to}} prevent the {{execution}} of the Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them. Under duress, Isabella abdicated in favor of Ferdinand on John Sigismund's behalf, in return for the two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins on 19July. Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26July.|$|E

5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón {{has often been}} {{credited}} with gaining {{the right to vote}} for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of <b>her</b> <b>supporters,</b> Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{apparently}} expected Elizabeth to {{help her}} regain her throne. Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley's murder. In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border but not too close to London. A commission of inquiry, or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569. In Scotland, <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on {{the same}} day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London.

She and Dudley were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.|$|E

Carrie Lam said she is a victim of [...] "white terror" [...] in response to online attacks on her, as well as on <b>her</b> <b>supporter</b> actress Josephine Siao.

Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38million people worldwide.|$|E
5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of <b>her</b> <b>supporters.</b> The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the city gate. Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between <b>her</b> <b>supporters,</b> and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to the walls, and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E

5|$|Harald Maddadsson {{was born}} shortly before Rognvald Kali Kolsson {{took control of}} the Earldom of Orkney, on the {{disappearance}} of Earl Paul Haakonsson. The Orkneyinga Saga reports the official tale, that Paul had abdicated, and the rumour that he was killed on the orders of Harald's mother. Earl Paul had not been well loved by his female kin. His mother and her sister, Frakkok, had previously tried to murder him with a poisoned shirt which instead caused the death of his brother Harald Haakonsson. Rognvald represented the pro-Norwegian faction in the Earldom. It is said that Frakkok and <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> had originally intended to advance the claims of Harald Haakon's son Erlend on Paul's death. However, Matad and Margaret, with King David backing them, imposed the infant Harald Maddadson as joint ruler with Rognvald.|$|E
5|$|His {{importance}} had dwindled {{with the}} victory of Agnes and <b>her</b> <b>supporters,</b> and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, {{there was a new}} chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 President Jimmy Carter pardoned Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda {{after they}} had served 25 years in prison.

Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Lebrón received a heroine's welcome by <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> upon her return to her motherland. Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro-independence activities. The couple had met while she was in prison, when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health. Their marriage took place eight years {{after they had}} met. They moved into a small house in Loiza. The house possessed few distinctive traits, mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room.|$|E

Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement.

5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of <b>her</b> <b>supporters</b> {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required two-thirds majority to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many sectors of society. The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition. People also protested the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, rising crime rates, and the tight currency controls. Kirchner dismissed the demonstration, and said that she would continue working as before. Most of the Kirchner loyalists, however, preferred simply to ignore the protest.|$|E

Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. <b>Her</b> <b>supporters</b> {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false.
