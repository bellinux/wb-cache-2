The separation conditions, such as pH, the plug length, and the concentration of bromobalhimycin, etc., were optimized in order to obtain satisfactory separations. As expected, for all tested 28 N-benzoylated amino acids, up to five times higher enantioresolutions were obtained on the eCAP neutral capillary compared to that on the polycationic polymer <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> modified capillary. Moreover, 26 of 28 tested racemic compounds were almost baseline- resolved without observing any interference {{from the front of the}} plug of bromobalhimycin.

40|$|The serum of {{patients}} with hereditary angioneurotic oedema contains small amounts of inhibitor of Cl-esterase (Cl-s) which is usually present in appreciable amounts in the serum of healthy individuals. In the citrated plasma of these patients in remission Cl-s activity was not detectable, but prolonged incubation with various alcohols, detergents, acetone, phenols and metal chelating agents generated the enzyme. Normal plasma {{did not respond to}} these reagents. The generation of Cl-s by alcohol and EDTA was inhibited by addition of natural inhibitor of Cl-s but not by soyabean trypsin inhibitor, trasylol and <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide.</b> <b>Hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> did not block the generation when experiments were carried out in silicon coated glassware. Incubation with kaolin and kallikrein generated Cl-s in remission plasma.

40|$|The antiheparin agent <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide,</b> in {{concentrations}} of 20 to 200 μg/ml., inhibited the activation by active Hageman factor of the plasma enzyme which releases kinin from substrate.

Surfaces which induce kinin formation by activating Hageman factor in plasma (glass, kaolin, celite, barium carbonate and carboxymethylcellulose) were inactivated by bathing in aqueous solutions of hexadimethrine. The effects of hexadimethrine on Hageman factor and on glass were not abolished by amounts of heparin which neutralize most other actions of hexadimethrine. Hexadimethrine prevented the activation by kaolin, but not by streptokinase, of p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-splitting and fibrinolytic factors in plasma; once these enzymes were activated by kaolin, {{they could not be}} inhibited by hexadimethrine.

40|$|A proteaselike {{permeability}} {{factor in}} guinea pig skin, which was fractionated in a latent form into pseudoglobulin fractions, was activated by contact with kaolin particles at neutral pH. This contact activation was not prevented {{by the presence}} of 1 M KCl but was strongly inhibited by the simultaneous presence of <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide.</b> In this activation, the latent permeability factor was first bound to kaolin; later an active form permeability factor was released from the kaolin-bound parent molecule. Prekallikrein activator activity was also generated in this supernatant from the pretreated kaolin particle in the same time course as the permeability factor generation. Moreover, since the prekallikrein activator and permeability factor were always observed at the same fractions in every purification step, with DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, Sephadex G- 75 gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing, these two molecules were recognized as identical.

Concentrations of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products (FDPs) were measured in five samples of uterine fluid. FDPs in the concentration detected had no effect on the anti-Xa assay. Heparin-like activity was higher in the group with menorrhagia, although the differences were not significant. Heparin-like activity increased throughout the menstrual cycle and decreased during menstruation, suggesting a possible cyclical variation in activity.

An amphotropic retrovirus (MFG-IRAP) was used ex vivo to transfer a cDNA encoding human interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) to synovium. The protocol required the transduced cells to secrete at least 30 ng IL- 1 Ra/ 106 cells per 48 h before reimplantation. Here we have evaluated various protocols for their efficiency in transducing cultures of human rheumatoid synoviocytes. The most reliably efficient methods used high titer retrovirus (approximately 108 infectious particles/ml). Transduction efficiency was increased further by exposing the cells to virus under flow-through conditions. The use of dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine (DOGS) as a polycation instead of Polybrene (<b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide)</b> provided an additional small increment in efficiency. Under normal conditions of static transduction, standard titer, clinical grade retrovirus (approximately 5 × 105 infectious particles/ml) failed to achieve the expression levels required by the clinical trial.

40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} {{creating}} an immobilized capillary tyrosinase (TRS) reactor {{based on a}} layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly for inhibitor screening is described. Tyrosinase was immobilized {{on the surface of}} fused-silica capillary via ionic binding technique with cationic polyelectrolyte <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (HDB). Then, HDB solution with the same plug length as the TRS was injected again into the capillary to cover the immobilized enzyme by forming HDB–TRS–HDB sandwich-like structure. Then, the substrate of l-tyrosine was introduced into the capillary and on-line enzyme inhibition study was performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The enzyme activity was determined by the quantification of peak area of the product of l-DOPA. Enzyme inhibition can be read out directly from the reduced peak area of the product in comparison with a reference electropherogram obtained {{in the absence of any}} inhibitor. The immobilized enzyme could withstand 25 consecutive assays by only losing 12 % activity.

HeLa monoclonal cell lines expressing either YFP-H 3 or YFP-H 3 CATD were generated by stable integration via Moloney murine leukemia retroviral delivery. The YFP-H 3 and YFP-H 3 CATD constructs (Black et al., 2004) were each sub-cloned into the retroviral plasmid, pBABE-BLAST (Shah et al., 2004), and these were subsequently co-transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with the VSV-G pseudotyping plasmid into 293 -GP cells (which express the retroviral gag and pol genes) to generate amphotropic retrovirus (Morgenstern and Land, 1990).

The interference {{is much less}} with bromcresol purple. It can be abolished by addition of <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide.</b> Chemical methods for albumin determination are mainly based {{on its ability to}} bind certain substances, especially an-ions. These methods are widely used because they are simple, rapid, and suited to automation. However, the various anionic dyes tested are affected by several drawbacks, including their ability to bind to other proteins besides albumin (1 - 4) and to some surfactants (5 - 8), and the competition of other sub-stances for the binding loci on the albumin molecule. While determining albumin by bromcresol green (BCG) we observed sometimes noticeable differences between results for serum and heparinized plasma from the same patients. Such differences were less for bromcresol purple (BCP). An interference with methods in which methyl orange or HABA [2 (4 ’-hydroxyazobenzene) -benzoic acid] dye is used has al-ready been reported (9, 10). Heparin interference is not appreciable when it is admin-istered in vivo, even at very high doses (11); however, it may interfere when added in vitro as an anticoagulant, especially when prepared tubes are not used but heparin is added in the ward at the time the blood is collected.

In this work, seven NSAIDs were separated within 9 min using 15 mM sodium tetraborate (pH 9. 2) containing 0. 1 % (w/v) <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (HDMB) and 10 % (v/v) methanol. Field-amplified sample injection (FASI) was examined and found to improve the detection limits by 200 -fold providing detection limits of 0. 6 – 2. 0 μg/L, but these are insufficient for the determination of NSAIDs as environmental pollutants in water samples. To improve the sensitivity further, electrokinetic supercharging (EKS) was examined. The optimum EKS method involved hydrodynamic injection leading electrolyte (100 mM NaCl, 30 s, 50 mbar), electrokinetic injection of the sample (200 s, − 10 kV) and finally injection of the terminating electrolyte (100 mM 2 -(cyclohexylamino) ethanesulphonic acid, CHES, 40 s, 50 mbar). With this method, the sensitivity was improved by 2400 -fold giving detection limits of 50 – 180 ng/L. The developed method was validated and then applied to the analysis of wastewater samples from a local sewage treatment plant. The detection limits were found to increase by approximately 10 -fold, however, this is still lower than levels previously found in wastewater samples from European and Mediterranean cities. The proposed method has the advantage of simplicity and achieving sensitivity through high-preconcentration power without the use of off-line chromatographic sample cleanup...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -AKR mice, {{which have}} a short mean {{survival}} time and usually die with leukaemia, were studied from one month of age for correlation between these two parameters. For untreated animals we found the same mean survival time whether or not leukaemia occurred. By treating sucklings with the polycations diethylaminoethyl-dextran or <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> the leukaemia incidence was significantly reduced. However, the mean survival time was unchanged, and remained the same in leukaemic and non-leukaemic animals. It is therefore suggested that the early death of AKR mice results from an ageing process and does not require leukaemia for implementation. Our prophylactic polycation treatment was furthermore found to induce spleen amyloid in some {{but not all of}} the mice that remained non-leukaemic. THE short mean survival time of AKR mice is generally attributed to the leukaemia which develops in most animals before death. However, we observed (Ebbesen, 1972) that prophylactic treatment of young non-leukaemic AKR mice with the amyloidogenic compound casein reduced the incidence of leukaemia without significant effect on mean survival time. As this raises the possibility that there is a hitherto unrecognized mechanism which ensures the early death of most animals irrespective of leukaemia, we have again looked into the mean survival time ofAKR mice. Those dying without evidence of leukaemia have been compared with those dying with leukaemia in a group of untreated mice, and in two experiments intended to reduce the incidence of leukaemia...|$|E
40|$|Poly-l-lysine and <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (polybrene) are {{cationic}} polymers {{which are}} frequently {{used to enhance}} the transduction efficiency of recombinant retroviruses in gene therapy experiments. Conversely, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan is an anionic polymer endogenously present in retrovirus stocks which inhibits transduction efficiency. An experimental study was performed to determine the mechanisms of retrovirus transduction modulation by these charged polymers, and {{it was found that}} they were capable of increasing or decreasing the flux of virus particles onto the cell surface. These effects, and adsorption in general, were independent of the cellular receptor-virus envelope interaction which was believed to provide the driving force for initial virus attachment. In order to consider the feasibility of alternative driving forces for virus attachment, a mathematical model of adsorption was constructed taking into account the electrostatic properties of the system. The model predicted that either cationic polymer-mediated virus aggregation or membrane charge shielding could yield adsorption phenomenon consistent with the previous observations. An experimental study was undertaken to distinguish between these two potential mechanisms, and it was found that both were at work depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the cationic polymer. All cationic polymers were capable of charge shielding, however, only high molecular weight polymers (> 15 kD) could aggregate the virus. Anionic polymers, conversely, were found to inhibit transduction and adsorption via preventing cationic polymers from performing these functions. by Howard E. Davis, Jr. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Rabbit Hageman {{factor was}} proteolytically cleaved and {{activated}} by a homogenate prepared from cultured rabbit endothelial cells. Cleavage of radiolabeled Hageman factor was monitored by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate. Endothelial cell-mediated cleavage of Hageman factor was demonstrated both in a purified system and in plasma, was time and concentration dependent, and was associated with formation of the characteristic 28, 000 Mr form of active Hageman factor. The rate of cleavage of Hageman factor was not affected by Triton X- 100 (Rohm and Haas, Co., Philadelphia, Pa.), <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (Polybrene, Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.), hirudin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or antisera to plasminogen or prekallikrein. However, cleavage was enhanced by kaolin, and was inhibited by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate. The enzyme responsible for cleavage of Hageman factor was localized to the 100, 000 -g-sedimentable, subcellular fraction of the endothelial cell homogenate and was relatively specific, because neither radiolabeled rabbit Factor XI nor rabbit prekallikrein were themselves proteolytically cleaved by the endothelial cell homogenate. However, when these molecules were incubated with the homogenate in the presence of Hageman factor, both Factor XI and prekallikrein were cleaved, demonstrating that Hageman factor had been activated by the endothelial cell homogenate. Furthermore, the kallikrein generated by endothelial cell homogenate-activated Hageman factor was capable of liberating kinin from high molecular weight kininogen as measured by bioassay. Cultured rabbit endothelial cells, therefore, possess the capacity to activate Hageman factor by proteolysis. This may be one mechanism for Hageman factor activation in vivo...|$|E

The methods presented combine sensitivity and speed of analysis for {{the wide range of}} inorganic ions used in this study. Separate methods were employed for the separation of anions and cations. The anion separation method utilised a low conductivity 70 mM Tris/ 70 mM CHES aqueous electrolyte (pH 8. 6) with a 90 cm capillary coated with <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> to reverse the EOF. Fifteen anions could be baseline separated in 7 min with detection limits in the range 27 - 240 ug/L.

Functionally, the molecule is the precursor of the activator of prekallikrein (Pre-PKA) and evidence is presented that it is identical with Hageman factor (clotting factor XII). The component from each plasma possessed similar characteristics. This molecule {{was found to have}} a mol wt of 110, 000 and sedimentation rate of 4. 6 S. It migrated in electrophoresis as a β-globulin, having an isoelectric point of 6. 1. Upon activation with glass, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, ellagic acid, or trypsin, the activated molecule converted purified prekallikrein (prokininogenase) to the active enzyme. Clot-promoting activity was associated with the capacity to activate prekallikrein through each procedure of isolation. The clot-promoting factor was in precursor form, requiring treatment with kaolin or trypsin to gain activity. Evidence indicated that the protein was Hageman factor (factor XII) : it promoted clotting of factor XII-deficient, but not Factor XI- or IX-deficient plasma, and did not convert fibrinogen to fibrin it bound to and was activated by kaolin or other negatively charged particles in the presence of chelating agents; the activation by kaolin could be prevented by pretreating the kaolin with <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (H Br); prekallikrein-activating and clot-promoting activities were identical in their physical properties; and the prekallikrein activator could not be detected in Hageman factor-deficient plasma. Activation of Hageman factor was accompanied by cleavage of the molecule into several fragments, one of which possessed prekallikrein-activating (PKA) and clot-promoting properties. The PKA fragment sedimented at 2. 6 S and by gel filtration was found to have a molecular weight of 32, 000.

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has been}} used for decades for the determination of different classes of pharmaceuticals in different sample matrices because of its advantageous high separation efficiency and fast analysis time. However, the major disadvantage of CE is its poor detection sensitivity. In the current work, the improvement in detection sensitivity of CE has been extensively studied and applied for the determination of two classes of pharmaceutical compounds. Electrokinetic supercharging (EKS), a powerful preconcentration technique in CE, has been studied for the analysis of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The separation selectivity was optimised via adjustment of the concentration of the separation buffer (disodium tetraborate pH 9. 20) and the amount of methanol as an organic modifier. Different EKS parameters, including injection voltage, injection time, and amounts of leading and terminating electrolytes were studied. The optimised conditions allowed detection sensitivity to be improved by 2, 400 -fold when compared to field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) and the limits of detection (LODs) were down to 50 ng/L. A valuable modification to the EKS system, namely counter-flow EKS (CF-EKS), has been developed in order to decrease the amount of the interfering sample matrix involved in the system, hence, larger amount of analytes could be concentrated. Computer simulation studies were undertaken {{in order to understand the}} trends in sensitivity enhancement from EKS to CF-EKS. After assigning the optimal counter pressure and injection voltage in CF-EKS, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed for optimising the injection time and the amount of terminating electrolyte. Upon comparison with FASS, the optimal conditions of CF-EKS allowed the sensitivity to be enhanced by 11, 800 -fold and the LODs were decreased to 10. 70 ng/L for the studied NSAIDs. The on-line hyphenation of EKS-CE with the highly precise electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was for the first time investigated, and then applied for the determination of five acidic hypolipidaemic drugs. The separation was performed in a co-electroosmotic flow (co-EOF) mode using the EOF reversal agent <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (HDMB) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 9. 00. An ANN was developed for the optimisation of the separation selectivity, and the EKS-ESI-MS system provided enhancement in detection sensitivity of 1, 000 -fold when compared to FASS. The LODs for the studied hypolipidaemic drugs were decreased to 180 ng/L. Simultaneous separation of charged and neutral hypolipidaemic drugs was made possible by the application of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. 50 was used as a separation electrolyte and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a micelle-forming agent. In order to enhance the detection sensitivity in MEKC, three on-line preconcentration strategies, namely sweeping, analyte focusing by micelle collapse (AFMC) and simultaneous FASS-sweeping were investigated and applied for the determination of eight hypolipidaemic drugs.

40|$|Biosensors detect target analytes through {{specific}} binding with biological recognition {{elements such}} as nucleic acids, enzymes, and antibodies. Many labs are working to create inexpensive and portable miniaturized sensors that allow for rapid sample analysis and low reagent consumption {{in order to increase}} biosensor accessibility in rural areas and third world countries. Lab-on-a-chip devices aim to incorporate sample preparation and analyte detection into one device in order to create self-contained sensors {{that can be used in}} rural areas and third world countries where laboratory equipment may not be available. Often, these devices incorporate microfluidics in order to shorten reaction times, reduce handling of hazardous samples, and take advantage of laminar flow [1]. However, while several successful lab-on-achip devices have been developed, incorporating sample preparation and analyte detection within one device is still a key challenge in the design of many biosensors. Sample preparation is extremely important for miniaturized sensors, which have a low tolerance for sample impurities and particulates [1]. In addition, significant sample concentration is often required to reduce sample volumes to the nL to mL range used in miniaturized sensors. This research aims to address the need for sample preparation within lab-on-a-chip systems through the use of functionalized electrospun nanofibers within polymer microfluidic devices. Electrospinning is a fiber formation process that uses electrical forces to form fibers with diameters on the order of 100 nm from polymer spinning dopes [2, 3]. The non-woven fiber mats formed during electrospinning have extremely high surface area to volume ratios, and can be used to increase the sensitivity and binding capacity of biosensors without increasing their size. Additionally, the fibers can be functionalized through the incorporation of nano and microscale materials within a polymer spinning dope. In this work, positively and negatively charged v nanofibers were created through the incorporation of <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (polybrene) and poly(maleic anhydride) (Poly(MA)) within a poly(vinyl alcohol) spinning dope. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the successful incorporation of polybrene and poly(MA) into the nanofibers. Gold microelectrodes were patterned on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to facilitate the incorporation of nanofibers within microfluidic devices. The gold microelectrodes served as grounded collector plates during electrospinning and produced well-aligned nanofiber mats. Microchannels 1 mm wide and 52 [MICRO SIGN]m deep were imprinted into PMMA through hot embossing with a copper template. PMMA pieces embossed with microchannels were bonded to PMMA pieces with gold microelectrodes and nanofibers using UV-assisted thermal bonding. Positively charged polybrene-modified nanofibers were shown to successfully filter negatively charged fluorescent liposomes out of a HEPES-sucrose-saline buffer, while negatively charged poly(MA) -modified nanofibers were shown to repel the liposomes. The effect of nanofiber mat thickness on liposome retention was studied using the z-scan function of a Leica confocal microscope. It was determined that positively charged nanofibers exhibited optimal liposome retention at thicknesses of 20 [MICRO SIGN]m and above. Negatively charged nanofiber mats over 40 [MICRO SIGN]m thick retained liposomes due to their small pore size despite their surface charge. Finally, it was demonstrated that a HEPES-sucrose-saline solution of pH 8. 5 could be used to change the charge of the positively charged polybrene nanofibers and allow for the release of previously bound liposomes. The results of this study can be used to design lab-on-a-chip devices capable of performing all sample preparation and analyte detection in one miniaturized microfluidic sensor. vi In addition, other nanofiber surface chemistries can be studied to create more specific sample filtration and allow for immobilization of biological recognition element. vi...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidic biosensors which {{incorporate}} both {{sample preparation}} and analyte detection, {{also referred to}} as lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, are a promising means of providing low cost, rapid, and portable analyte detection in point-of-care, rural, and developing world applications 1 - 3. However, despite numerous reports of LOC devices capable of detecting a range of clinical analytes 1 - 3, there are several key challenges that face the development of true LOC devices. First, due to the small size of these miniaturized systems, it is often necessary to significantly concentrate the sample volume to the nL-[MICRO SIGN]L range 4. Additionally, samples must be purified to remove particulates and impurities that may impede analyte detection. Finally, fluid flow in microfluidic devices is generally laminar, which limits the amount of fluid mixing that occurs within the channels 5 - 7. Because rapid fluid mixing is typically required to facilitate chemical reactions and ensure access of analytes to functional surfaces within the microchannels, micromixers need to be incorporated into the design of a LOC device. This research aims to address the need for both better sample preparation and fluid mixing within microfluidic assays through the use of functionalized electrospun nanofibers. Electrospinning is a fiber formation process in which electrical forces are used to form ultrathin fibers from viscous polymer spinning solutions 8. The nonwoven fiber mats produced during electrospinning are characterized by extremely large surface-area-to-volume ratios and high porosities. Additionally, electrospun nanofibers can easily be functionalized either through the inclusion of nanoscale materials into the polymer spinning dope, or through post-spinning modifications. In this work, positively and negatively charged poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers were created through the addition of <b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide</b> (polybrene) and poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (poly(MVE/MA), respectively, into a 10 % w/v PVA spinning solution. Additionally, larger diameter polystyrene (PS) microfibers with a range of morphologies were spun using 12. 5, 15, and 17 % w/v PS spinning solutions. Previously, gold microelectrodes patterned onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were used to incorporate the nanofibers into microfluidic channels 9, 10. However, in this work, fibers were bonded into microchannels without the use of a gold electrode, resulting in simple, inexpensive device fabrication. Both PVA and PS fibers were spun onto metal collector plates and manually transferred to pieces of PMMA that had undergone UV-Ozone treatment. In order to produce nanofiber mats with uniform fiber distributions along their height, thin nanofiber mats were stacked together to create multilayered mats 11, 12. Positively charged PVA mats were shown to successfully bind and concentrate E. coli cells, while negatively charged PVA mats repelled the cells and were used to minimize nonspecific retention within the channels. The 3 D morphology of the PVA nanofiber mats was optimized to eliminate nonspecific mechanical retention of the E. coli while also providing sufficient surface area for E. coli capture. Finally, anti-E. coli antibodies were immobilized on negatively charged PVA fibers to allow for successful specific capture of the analyte. Fluid mixing within Y-shaped microchannels was enhanced through the incorporation of both PVA nanofibers and PS microfibers, though the PVA fibers produced the most significant mixing. We assume that mixing within the PVA nanofiber mats is caused by the inhomogeneity of pore size and pore distribution within the mats rather than by the individual nanofibers. Statistical analysis of mixing within the nanofiber mats indicates that mixing is dependent on the height of the nanofiber mat (i. e. the number of layers) but is independent of the length of the nanofiber mat. As expected, the amount of mixing observed increased with decreasing fluid flow rate. The results of this study can be used to provide both enhanced sample preparation and fluid mixing with microfluidic biosensors. In addition, further functionalization of the nanofiber surfaces can be used to allow for detection {{of a wide range of}} analytes. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E

Kahn. 2000. Essential role of insulin substrate- 2 in insulin stimulation of glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake in brown adipocytes. *J. Biol Chem* 275 : 25494 - 25501. ### Reagents: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ### Protocol: Prepare: - shaking waterbath 37 °C - Thaw isolation buffer and add collagenase (1. 5 mg/ml) (Collagenase A, B&M; Roche, catalog # 103 578) vortex - Sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) - Reserve tissue culture hood - Warm up primary cell culture medium (which includes 20 mM HEPES and 20 % FBS) 1. Remove interscapular brown fat pad from mice (age late fetal to post natal day 2) - Dissect and mince tissue on parafilm with 500 ul PBS (sterile), use sterile pipette tips, indent parafilm in center so PBS will stay in the center. - Pipette tissue into 500 ul collagenase solution in Eppendorf vials (total volume now about 1000 ul). - Vortex for 10 seconds. - Put Eppendorf vials into shaking waterbath at 90 cycles/minutes (use plastic box and red weights) for 30 seconds and vortex for 10 seconds every 5 minutes - digestion should not exceed 40 minutes. - Filter digested tissue through 100 um filters (LABCOR PRODUCTS, INC. P. O. Box 7277, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20898 - 7277, catalog # 30 - 1, Sterile Nytex Membrane Filter, 38 x 38 mm, 100 Micron, 50 /pkg, Individually Wrapped, order from: PGC Scientific, 7311 Governors Way, Frederick, Maryland 21704, 800 - 424 - 3300, catalog # 358 - 201) into fresh, autoclaved Eppendorf vials. - Centrifuge Eppendorf vials at RT at 1500 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge) for 5 minutes. - During centrifugation add 2 ml pre-warmed culture medium to 12 well plates. - Remove supernatant (use 1 ml automatic pipette). - Re-suspend pellet in 1 ml culture medium per sample (use 1 ml automatic pipette) and transfer into a 12 well plate. - Leave cells overnight to get plated (day 1). - Next day: wash cells with 3 mls culture medium and add 3 mls fresh culture medium (day 2). (N. B. Cells are sensitive to cold and aspirating therefore hand aspirate.) ### 2.) IMMORTALIZING BROWN FAT CELLS- ESTABLISHING CELL LINES After cells are plated overnight, (day 1), next day wash cells (day 2), on day 3 need to add virus (pBabe SV 40 Large T antigen puromycin). *(preparation of viral stock see protocol 3) * To each well add: VIRUS SOLUTION which consists of: 1) 50 % primary culture media, 2) 50 % viral stock, 3) 1 X polybreen- 8 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in ddH 2 O- final conc. 4 ug/ml(1 : 2000 dilution) (<b>hexadimethrine</b> <b>bromide,</b> Sigma, catalog # H- 9268) 1), 2), 3), should add up to approximately 0. 9 ml/well. For example: if there are 6 wells with cells to be immortalized you need 6 (X) (0. 9 ml) = 5. 4 ml total volume containing primary culture media, viral stock and polybreen. Thus, take 2. 7 mls of primary culture media, 2. 7 mls of viral stock, and 2. 7 ul of polybreen stock, mix by pipetting, filter sterile using a 0. 45 micron filter. Then, for each well, pipette off media, DO NOT USE VACUUM (vacuum will disrupt cells too much), rinse well with 2 mls pre-warmed primary culture media, pipette off rinsing media and add VIRUS SOLUTION VERY SLOWLY!!!!!!! NEXT DAY: split cells into 15 cm dishes - pipette off VIRUS SOLUTION - rinse well with 2 mls DMEM - high (without FBS) - pipette off, put in ≅ 0. 2 ml trypsin for ≅ 3 minutes (until cells just come off plate) - add 2 mls primary culture media, transfer to 15 cm dish containing 25 mls primary culture media. TWO DAYS LATER: start puromycin (Sigma, catalog # P 8833) selection (2 ug/ml puromycin into DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS). Leave in puromycin media for one week. (At this point some cells can be split off to differentiate or do some experiments with.) After puromycin selection cells need {{to be put into}} media directed against *mycoplasma* *infection* (BM Cyclin, Boehringer Mannheim, catalog # 799 050). This will take approximately 2 - 3 weeks. Once cells have been in puromycin and mycoplasma selection they can be frozen down. ### 3.) SV 40 LARGE T ANTIGEN VIRUS PRODUCTION Pharmacia’s Cell Phect protocol with slight modifications (Cell Phect Transfection Kit, Pharmacia Biotech, Cat. # 27 - 9268 - 01) -Grow φNX Cells (see below) in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent 4 pm evening 1. Dissolve 15 ug of SV 40 T-pBabe-puro in 480 ul distilled water. - Add 480 ul buffer A - Vortex briefly and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. - Add 960 ul buffer B with blue pipette tip {{while at the same time}} you are “bubbling” the solution with an automatic pipette. - Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. - Add the precipitate to the φ cell culture (in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent) as evenly as possible and support distribution by rotating the dish in a figure eight configuration a few times. Next morning (i. e. 10 a. m.) : 1. Aspirate the medium and rinse the cells CAREFULLY with 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H (no FBS) twice. - Add 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the cells. Same day (i. e. 4 pm.) : 1. Change the medium to 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : First viral harvest: 1. Aspirate supernatant with a 50 cc sterile syringe + 18 G sterile needle. - Remove needle and put 0. 45 micron filter in front of the syringe. - Press the supernatant through the filter into a 50 ml blue top tube. - Add polybrene (4 ug per ml) to the supernatant and mix. - Freeze 1 ml aliquots in sterile freezing vials and store in (-) 80 °C freezer. - Add 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the φ cells. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : Second harvest exactly like the first one. **NOTES ON HANDLING φ NX CELLS** 1. The cells are grown in DMEM-High + 10 % FBS at 5 % CO 2. - The cells grow rapidly. - The cells come off of the dish very easily so be careful when washing/feeding them. - The cells are frozen in 90 % FBS + 10 % DMSO (dimethly sulfoxide) - It is recommended that the cells are not allowed to reach confluence and that they are periodically grown in selection media to maintain their retroviral packaging “goodies”. **φNX Cell Selection Media** DMEM-High + 10 % FBS + 300 ug/ml Hygromycin B + 1 ug/ml Diptheria Toxin A The cells will round up some, they don’t look very good but it’s OK. The cells need to be in selection only about 4 - 7 days, then place themback into regular media and allow them to “recover” to their normal morphology before using and/or freezing them. Additional information and more details regarding the φ NX cells can be found on the Nolan lab homepage at: www. Stanford. edu/group/Nolan/. ### 4.) CULTURING BROWN FAT CELLS ### Media: 1. DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS - DMEM high no FBS (for rinsing cells) -always use new pipette - DMEM high no FBS (for starving cells) - DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS (+) insulin and T 3 - Differentiation Media - Induction Media (see below) ### Typical Differentiation Time Course: - Day 1 - split into Differentiation Media - 2 - 3 - Day 4 - induce confluent cells - 5 - Day 6 - put back into Differentiation media - 7 - 8 - aspirate off old media and add fresh Differentiation media - 9 - Day 10 - fully differentiated cells ready to be used for: Oil Red O staining, RNA/DNA extraction, Western analysis etc. **MASTER PLATE** - one large dish 15 cm - Always in DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **To split**: if confluent a 1 : 20 split (ie. - 1 ml cells plus 25 mls media will reach confluence in 3 days) - Aspirate off media - Rinse cells using DMEM high (no FBS) - fill 25 ml pipette to top- rinse each Master plate with 18 ml - Add 2. 5 mls trypsin/plate (always use new pipette) - Put back into CO 2 for at least 20 mins. (while trypsinizing label other plates/dishes) - (leave cells alone while trypsinizing- this seems to help avoid cells from clumping) **Preparation for “Splitting” Plates** - decide what kind and how many plates are needed: ie: - 6 well plate- gets 4 mls differentiation media plus 12 drops of cells - 12 well plate: gets 2 mls differentiation media - 10 cm dish- gets 8 mls Differentiation media (+) 3 ml cells- usually can get 2 - 4 mg protein - 15 cm dish- Master plate – ALWAYS gets 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **After labelling plates:** - Take out trypsinized Master Plate - Add 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS, pipette up and down three times to disperse cells and break up clumps - add - 1 ml to Master plate, - 12 drops into 4 mls differentiation media- 6 well plate, - 3 mls cells into 8 mls differentiation media- 10 cm. Dish - while plating out one cell type-others can remain in trypsin in the hood - when done “splitting” cells take Master plate and 10 cm dish and “distribute” cells evenly by moving dishes in a “figure eight” configuration ten times (for 6 well plates use a “faster” figure eight) FREEZING CELLS- freeze cells in DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS (+) 10 % DMSO ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") INDUCTION MEDIA - when cells are confluent - prepare fresh – use only on the day you need it - Aspirate off differentiation media and add induction media- no rinsing - 11 mls per plate - For 200 mls Media: add 200 mls Differentiation media to top of 500 ml filter bottle add: 1. 0. 125 M indomethacin (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # I- 7378) - 2 mg/ml dexamethasone-vortex (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # D- 1756) - 0. 25 M IBMX (500 X) - 400 ul-(Sigma, catalog # I- 5879) must add immediately after thawing - thaw - vortex - add back to heating block - all three are dissolved in 100 % ethanol and stored frozen in (-) 20 freezer - 1) and 3) must be heated to 75 °C (use heating block) ### 5.) OIL RED O STAINING PROTOCOL This protocol is used to test for lipid accumulation in fully differentiated cells. Stock Oil Red O: 0. 5 g Oil Red O (Sigma, catalog # 0 - 0625) in 100 ml isopropanol 1. Rinse plates with PBS - Fix cells by covering with PBS + 10 % formaldehyde or with commercially available buffered formalin (Sigma, catalog # HT 50 - 1 - 640) - Let plates sit at least 15 min. or as long as overnight, at room temperature, alternatively plates can be left @ 4 °C until multiple plates are collected. - Prepare Oil Red O working solution (make fresh each time, as working solution is unstable) by adding 6 ml stock to 4 ml ddH 20. Mix and filter through Whatman # 1 filter paper. (The filtration step takes awhile; it is not advisable to hasten the process by applying a vacuum because there is too much stuff to filter out.) Make about 5 ml per 10 cm plate to be stained. - Remove fixation agent, add Oil Red O stain. - Sit 1 hour (or longer) at room temperature. - Rinse several times, carefully, with distilled water to remove excess stain and any precipitate that forms. - Maintain dishes in water if intact cells are desired. - Pour off distilled water and allow dishes to air dry. - Scan plate...|$|E
