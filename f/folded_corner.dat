25|$|The {{decision}} of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled {{speculation that the}} NBA will occasionally fix the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send {{the best player in}} the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used 7 envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into the tumbler, causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern took a deep breath before reaching into the tumbler and picking the envelope with the <b>folded</b> <b>corner.</b> No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.|$|E

40|$|EP 2039612 A 1 UPAB: 20090409 NOVELTY - The {{folding box}} (12) {{comprises}} a folding tab (13), which is formed at the sealing flap (2) over a length between the <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> (1) at the sealing flap and the edge. The length remains {{up to the}} edge of the sealing flap. The folding tab is inserted into the <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> at another sealing flap (3) when locking the folding box independently by the <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> at the sealing flap. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for locking a folding box. USE - Folding box for dust and insect resistant packing made of a single piece. ADVANTAGE - The length remains {{up to the edge}} of the sealing flap, and the folding tab is inserted into the <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> at another sealing flap when locking the folding box independently by the <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> at the sealing flap, and thus ensures mechanical protection and an economical manufacturing of the folding box...|$|R

The carton (12) may be sealed on each of two sides by two sealing flaps (2, 3) connected to opposing side pieces (10), of which a first sealing flap covers the side completely and the second sealing flap (3) merely partly coverts the side. The <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> and the second sealing flap provide a continuous adhesive surface (6), {{for the application of}} an adhesive along the side pieces to which the above are joined, permitting a closed gluing of the total edge of the first sealing flap on closing the carton. The <b>folded</b> <b>corners</b> each extend on the first sealing flap just to a point at a separation from the side piece, which is smaller than or the same as a length difference between the sealing flaps. USE - For automatic packaging of items ADVANTAGE - Permits economical insect and dust resistant packaging without need for additional inner ba...|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the round, {{the players}} show their hands and total each one up, only {{counting}} cards of the same suit. For instance, if the three cards in a hand are all different suits, the highest value card would stand as that player's score. The player whose hand scored the lowest is declared the loser, and must subsequently <b>fold</b> a <b>corner</b> of his/her five dollar bill. When a player has <b>folded</b> all 4 <b>corners</b> of his/her five dollar bill, that player is immediately out of game play. It {{is important to note that}} in the event of a tie between two players for lowest score, both players are declared losers and each <b>folds</b> a <b>corner</b> of their five dollar bill. If there is a tie involving the knocker, the knocker pays, this is in accordance with the concept that the one betting must beat at least one player or else they pay up.|$|R

25|$|The pagoda {{is located}} about 2 km {{southwest}} of the centre of Dunhuang city. It was repaired in the Daoguang era (1821-1851) and again in 1992. It is 12 metres (39 feet) high and 7 metres (23 feet) in diameter and consists of 9 levels in total. The exterior is built of adobe bricks and is filled with grass and mud mixed with lime.

40|$|Ensuring {{uniformity}} in the nomenclature {{standardization of}} facial creases {{is important to}} enable the scholarly community to follow and debate the advancements in research. This review highlights the prevailing disparity in the nomenclature that refers to the same facial crease by researchers and laypeople, and suggests uniform names for the facial creases based on available literature. The previous and current trends in facial crease classification are also discussed. The nomenclature of the facial creases considered for this review include the following: the nasolabial <b>fold,</b> <b>corner</b> of the mouth lines, upper and lower lip creases around the mouth region, the mandibular folds, the bifid nose, the transverse nasal line, the vertical glabellar line, chin crease, the mental crease, four type of creases around the eyes, forehead creases, and periauricular creases. A figure illustrating the above facial creases is included as reference. It is hoped that the proposed standardization of nomenclature would ensure a more scientific referencing of facial creases enabling more effective scientific interaction among the scholarly {{community as well as}} the laypeople interested in the research and application of facial creases...|$|R

40|$|Saturnino Marco Lupi, Matteo Cislaghi, Silvana Rizzo, Ruggero Rodriguez y Baena Department of Clinical Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy Background: The {{onset of}} {{perioral}} wrinkles often prompts patients to request treatment. This aesthetic deterioration linked to aging {{may be associated}} with tooth and alveolar bone loss in fully edentulous patients. Purpose: To evaluate perioral wrinkles before and after maxillary and mandibular rehabilitation with implant-retained dentures in fully edentulous patients. Methods: In this prospective cohort, single-center, blinded study, patients requiring maxillary and mandibular rehabilitation with implant-retained dentures were enrolled. The patients were photographed in the same position before and after oral rehabilitation. Wrinkles were evaluated in the photographs by blinded observers using validated rating scales. The following parameters were analyzed: upper and lower radial lip lines, marionette lines, upper and lower lip fullness, nasolabial <b>folds,</b> <b>corner</b> of the mouth lines, and the labiomental crease. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for paired data, with P< 0. 05 considered significant. Results: Upper and lower implant-retained dentures were applied in 31 patients (15 males; mean ± standard deviation age 62. 13 ± 8. 69 years, range 47 – 77 years). The oral rehabilitation procedures significantly improved (P< 0. 05) the upper and lower radial lip lines, marionette lines, upper and lower lip fullness, the nasolabial <b>folds,</b> and the <b>corner</b> of the mouth lines. Conclusion: Maxillary and mandibular rehabilitation with implant-retained dentures in fully edentulous patients improves perioral aesthetics. Patients requiring oral rehabilitation and desiring perioral aesthetic improvement could benefit from treatment with this type of prosthesis.
