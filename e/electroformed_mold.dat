40|$|Based on the COMSOL Multiphysics software, the {{electric}} field distribution {{and the growth}} front of electroformed layer on the cathode surface were simulated during the electroforming process. The simulation {{results show that the}} uniformity of electroformed layer with micro/nano-cavities can be effectively improved with a better replication quality by using a lower initial current density. Both nano-diaphragm and nanopillar array are selected as masters for the electroforming experiments. When the initial current density decreases from 4 A/dm 2 to 1 A/dm 2, the maximum deviation of characteristic width between the nano-diaphragm master and mold inserts dramatically decreases from 60 nm to &# 177; 20 nm. By setting proper current density and enhancing mass transfer near the cathode surface, the characteristic diameter dimension error of <b>electroformed</b> <b>mold</b> inserts for nanopillar array decreases from 6. 27 % to 2. 49 %. The replication quality of <b>electroformed</b> <b>mold</b> inserts with micro/nano-cavities can be significantly improved by these methods...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{to achieve a}} LRHH (low roughness and high hardness) electroforming process is developed in this study. Because <b>electroformed</b> <b>molds</b> with low roughness and high hardness are required for microlens array fabrication using the LIGA-like process, the invented Ni-Co alloy-pressurized electroforming process is used to fabricate a metallic micro-mold for microlens array molding. The electrolyte parameters such as Co content, current density, brightener content, pH value and temperature will be examined with respect to roughness and hardness. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to construct a system model that accurately predicts the responses for arbitrary parameter settings. A genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to minimize the surface roughness and improve the micro-mold hardness. The {{results show that the}} micro-mold surface roughness and hardness could be significantly improved using the ANN/GA approach. A LRHH electroforming process is carried out using parameter design to improve the surface morphology and increase the service life of the micro-mold during the forming process...|$|R
40|$|According to a proposal, basic x-ray {{lithography}} would {{be extended to}} incorporate a technique, called inverse tomography, that would enable the fabrication of microscopic three-dimensional (3 D) objects. The proposed inverse tomo-lithographic process would {{make it possible to}} produce complex shaped, submillimeter-sized parts that would be difficult or impossible to make in any other way. Examples of such shapes or parts include tapered helices, paraboloids with axes of different lengths, and even Archimedean screws that could serve as rotors in microturbines. The proposed inverse tomo-lithographic process would be based partly on a prior microfabrication process known by the German acronym LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung, which means lithography, <b>electroforming,</b> <b>molding).</b> In LIGA, one generates a precise, high-aspect ratio pattern by exposing a thick, x-ray-sensitive resist material to an x-ray beam through a mask that contains the pattern. One can electrodeposit metal into the developed resist pattern to form a precise metal part, then dissolve the resist to free the metal. Aspect ratios of 100 : 1 and patterns into resist thicknesses of several millimeters are possible...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in the development of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), particularly in the lithography techniques such as LIGA (German acronym for lithography, <b>electroforming,</b> <b>molding).</b> However, in many cases the components produced by filling of the mold with metal during the electrodeposition process show considerable variations in their properties in particular mechanical properties (e. g. [1]). Large batch-to-batch as well as considerable local property variations within single components are often observed. With the continuously shrinking size and dimensions of the microcomponents such non-uniformities are becoming intolerable. The current research addresses the issues of performance variability and reliability concerns frequently encountered with conventional nickel LIGA microcomponents produced by electrodeposition methods. Two types of nickel microsamples were synthesized using 1) conventional electrodeposition with polycrystalline structure and 2) a newly developed electrodeposition method that results in nanocrystalline structure. Microstructural characterization was performed on these materials in terms of chemical composition, grain size distribution and average grain size, as well as crystallographic texture. Microstructural analysis involved scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) while the mechanical properties were evaluated using nanoindentation technique...|$|R
40|$|Microfabrication {{technology}} {{using the}} LIGA (a German acronym for Lithography, <b>Electroforming,</b> and <b>Molding)</b> process offers an attractive alternative for fabricating precision devices with micron-sized features. One such device is a mm-sized micro-undulator with potential applications in a table-top synchrotron light source for medical and other industrial uses. The undulator {{consists of a}} silver conductor embedded in poles and substrate of nickel-iron. Electromagnetic modeling of the undulator is done using the eddy current computer code ELEKTRA. Computations predict a field pattern of appropriate strength and quality if the current can be prevented from being shunted from silver by the nickel-iron poles either through insulation or through slotted poles. The design of the undulator along with the computational results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Miniature {{scroll pumps}} have been {{proposed}} as roughing pumps (low - vacuum pumps) for miniature scientific instruments (e. g., portable mass spectrometers and gas analyzers) that depend on vacuum. The larger scroll pumps used as roughing pumps in some older vacuum systems are fabricated by conventional machining. Typically, such an older scroll pump includes (1) an electric motor with an eccentric shaft to generate orbital motion of a scroll and (2) conventional bearings to restrict the orbital motion to a circle. The proposed miniature scroll pumps would differ from the prior, larger ones in both design and fabrication. A miniature scroll pump would include two scrolls: one mounted on a stationary baseplate and one on a flexure stage (see figure). An electromagnetic actuator {{in the form of}} two pairs of voice coils in a push-pull configuration would make the flexure stage move in the desired circular orbit. The capacitance between the scrolls would be monitored to provide position (gap) feedback to a control system that would adjust the drive signals applied to the voice coils to maintain the circular orbit as needed for precise sealing of the scrolls. To minimize power consumption and maximize precision of control, the flexure stage would be driven at the frequency of its mechanical resonance. The miniaturization of these pumps would entail both operational and manufacturing tolerances of < 1 m. Such tight tolerances cannot be achieved easily by conventional machining of high-aspect-ratio structures like those of scroll-pump components. In addition, the vibrations of conventional motors and ball bearings exceed these tight tolerances by an order of magnitude. Therefore, the proposed pumps would be fabricated by the microfabrication method known by the German acronym LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung, which means lithography, <b>electroforming,</b> <b>molding)</b> because LIGA {{has been shown to be}} capable of providing the required tolerances at large aspect ratios...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{description}} of the LIGA process using a 600 MeV　superconducting　compact synchrotron light source. The realization of deep-etch x-ray lithography is based on a new　resist and mask. The resist is made of a copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacryl acid (MAA). The main benefit is its high sensitivity, which is one order of magnitude greater than that of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) used in the LIGA process. The mask is composed of a 2 mum thick silicon nitride membrane with high transparency supporting tungsten absorber which is a 5 mum-thick. Experimental results about deep-etch x-ray lithography, <b>electroforming</b> and <b>molding</b> techniques are presented. Micro-ultrasonic transmitter obtained with these techniques is also shown.

40|$|Miniature {{inchworm}} actuators {{that would}} have relatively simple designs have been proposed for applications {{in which there are}} requirements for displacements of the order of microns or tens of microns and for the ability to hold their positions when electric power is not applied. The proposed actuators would be members of the class of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), but would be designed and fabricated following an approach that is somewhat unusual for MEMS. Like other MEMS actuators, the proposed inchworm actuators could utilize thermoplastic, bimetallic, shape-memory-alloy, or piezoelectric actuation principles. The figure depicts a piezoelectric inchworm actuator according to the proposal. As in other inchworm actuators, linear motion of an extensible member would be achieved by lengthening and shortening the extensible member in synchronism with alternately clamping and releasing one and then {{the other end of the}} member. In this case, the moving member would be the middle one; the member would be piezoelectric and would be shortened by applying a voltage to it. The two outer members would also be piezoelectric; the release of the clamps on the upper or lower end would be achieved by applying a voltage to the electrodes on the upper or lower ends, respectively, of these members. Usually, MEMS actuators cannot be fabricated directly on the side walls of silicon wafers, yet the geometry of this actuator necessitates such fabrication. The solution, according to the proposal, would be to use the microfabrication technique known by the German acronym LIGA - "lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung," which means lithography, <b>electroforming,</b> <b>molding.</b> LIGA involves x-ray lithography of a polymer film followed by selective removal of material to form a three-dimensional pattern from which a mold is made. Among the advantages of LIGA for this purpose are that it is applicable to a broad range of materials, can be used to implement a variety of designs, including those of structures > 1 mm high, affords submicron precision, and is amenable to mass production at relatively low unit cost. Fabrication of the proposed actuators would involve some technological risks - in particular, in the integration of electrode connection lines and placement of actuator elements. It will also be necessary to perform an intensive study of the feasibility of growing piezoelectric crystals onto LIGA molds...|$|R
40|$|LIGA is a {{micromachining}} {{technology that}} uses high energy x-rays from a synchrotron to create patterns with small lateral dimensions in a deep, non-conducting polymeric resist. Typical dimensions for LIGA parts are microns {{to tens of}} microns in lateral size, and hundreds of microns to millimeters in depth. Once the resist is patterned, metal is electrodeposited in the features to create metal microparts, or to create a metal mold for subsequent replication. The acronym LIGA comes from the German words for lithography, <b>electroforming,</b> and <b>molding,</b> and the technology has been under worldwide development {{for more than a}} decade. over the last five years, a full-service capability to produce metal microparts using the LIGA process has been established at Sandia national Laboratories, California.

40|$|Short {{wavelength}} FELs impose stringent {{requirements on}} the quality of the electron beams. The key factor in obtaining a single-pass UV or x-ray FEL is the generation of small emittance electron beams with ultra-high brightness. The pioneering work at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the last decade has resulted in a dramatic improvement in the production of high electron beam brightness and small beam emittance using rf photocathode gun. The lower bound on the emittance of a 1 -nC bunch without any emittance compensation is on the order of 3 {pi} mm-mrad. This is well within the emittance requirement being considered here. Although the original R&D work at Argonne, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Wisconsin-Madison, has produced encouraging results in the area of rf structure design, x-ray mask fabrication, and LIGA processing (Lithography, <b>Electroforming,</b> and <b>Molding),</b> the goal to prove feasibility has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we will present feasibility studies for a compact single-pass mm-linac FEL based on LIGA technology. This system will consist of a photocathode rf gun operated at 30 GHz, a 50 -MeV superconducting constant gradient structure operated at 60 GHz, and a microundulator with 1 -mm period...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electroformed</b> {{microfluidic}} chip <b>mold</b> faces {{the problem of}} uneven thickness, which decreases the dimensional accuracy of the mold, and increases the production cost. To fabricate a mold with uniform thickness, two methods are investigated. Firstly, experiments are carried out to study how the ultrasonic agitation affects the thickness uniformity of the mold. It is found that the thickness uniformity is maximally improved by about 30 % after 2 h electroforming under 200 kHz and 500 W ultrasonic agitation. Secondly, adding a second cathode, a method suitable for long-time electroforming is studied by numerical simulation. The simulation results show that with a 4 mm width second cathode used, the thickness uniformity is improved by about 30 % after 2 h of electroforming, and that with electroforming time extended, the thickness uniformity is improved more obviously. After 22 h electroforming, the thickness uniformity is increased by about 45 %. Finally, by comparing two methods, the method of adding a second cathode is chosen, and a {{microfluidic chip}} mold is made {{with the help of}} a specially designed second cathode.
