40|$|The organophosphorous {{pesticides}} (OPPs) contaminations {{have been}} reported to occur in some Chinese waters. To describe the contamination status and the spatial distribution of OPPs in the surface water throughout China, samples were collected from over 600 sites located in the surface water of seven major river basins and three main internal rivers drainage areas during 2003 and 2004. The surface water samples were analyzed for the representative OPPs including dichlorvos, <b>demeton,</b> dimethoate, methyl parathion, malathion and parathion. In general, the most frequently detected compound was dichlorvos and <b>demeton,</b> being detected in 89. 1 % of samples (mean = 17. 8 ng/L; range < 1. 4 - 1, 552. 0 ng/L) for dichlorvos, and 78. 2 % of samples (mean = 35. 4 ng/L; range < 1. 5 - 2, 560. 0 ng/L) for <b>demeton.</b> While the detection frequencies of the dimethoate, methyl parathion, malathion, and parathion were all less than 50 % in all the surface water samples. Measured concentrations for the six compounds were low and rarely exceed the environment quality standard for surface water of China. The six OPPs compounds were more frequently detected at much higher concentrations in the rivers of north China compared with those of south China. The results of this investigation indicate that OPPs contamination in the Yellow River, Huaihe River, Liaohe River, and Haihe River basins of north China should be of particular concern. When compared with other regions of the world, it appears that the Chinese surface water is some moderately polluted by dimethoate, methyl parathion, malathion, parathion and contaminated by dichlorvos and <b>demeton</b> in certain degree...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of pesticide resistance in Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval) and studies on the genetics and management of pesticide resistance in China. This mite has developed resistance to at least 25 pesticides in China. It first developed resistance to parathion and <b>demeton.</b> As early as 1962, the level of resistance to <b>demeton</b> in T. cinnabarinus reached 62 times, which resulted in control failure of this mite on cotton in most cotton growing areas in China. The genetics of omethoate-resistance and monocrotophos-resistance in T. cinnabarinus is each controlled by an incompletely dominant gene and {{the development of}} resistance is therefore rapid. The developmental time and other life table parameters of T. cinnabarinus are altered when the mite becomes pesticide-resistant: life cycle becomes shorter and reproductive rate becomes greater. This is another reason for the rapid development of pesticide resistance in T. cinnabarinus. Pesticide resistance may be managed by rotational use of pesticides, biological control and other methods. Key words: Tetranychus cinnabarinus, pesticide resistance, Chin...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to prepare core colloids that are modified using zirconium oxychloride, based on heating a solution of core colloid composites, consisting of poly (ethylenimine) (PEI) and zirconium oxychloride. The interaction of zirconium oxychloride with the polystyrene (PS) core colloids has been investigated using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data. FT-IR studies confirm the occurrence of amine groups present in PEI which are oxidized to carboxyl groups after the reaction. The EDX data and the SEM images confirm the presence of zirconium particles immobilized on the polystyrene surfaces. <b>Demeton,</b> a highly toxic nerve agent, was used due to its ability to easily bind through its organophosphate group illustrating a practical application of the PS-PEI-Zr particles. Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) Spectroscopy {{was used to assess}} the interactions between the toxic nerve agent demeton-S and the PS-PEI-Zr particles. The results show that the presented technique for coating polystyrene core colloids with zirconium was successfully accomplished, and the newly formed particles easily bond with <b>demeton</b> agents through the P=O functional group...|$|E
40|$|Four generic heterobifunctional reagents, namely 2 -(2 -chloro- 5 -methyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphosphorinan- 5 -yl) {{methoxyacetic acid}} methyl ester, p-sulfide, 2 -(2 -chloro- 5 -methyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphosphorinan- 5 -yl) methoxyacetic acid methyl ester, p-oxide, 2 -(2 -mercapto- 5 -methyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphosphorinan- 5 -yl) methoxyacetic acid bispotassium salt, p-sulfide-, and (2 -methoxy- 5 -methyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphosphorinan- 5 -yl) methoxyacetic acid, methyl ester, have been {{synthesized}} {{and used to}} prepare organophosphate, thiophosphate, and dithiophosphate haptens containing a functional carboxyl group {{which can be used}} to conjugate the haptens to proteins. These hapten-protein conjugates have been used as antigens for preparing polyclonal sera against all classes of organophosphate pesticides. The eight examples used protein-hapten conjugates of chlorpyrifos, parathion, diazinon, paraoxon, azinphos, dimethoate, <b>demeton,</b> and dichlorvos. These were all immunogenic and resulted in sera containing antibodies that recognized the corresponding parent pesticide with high specificity...|$|E
40|$|Quarterly {{samples of}} Waipahu Incinerator quench water and Sand Island and Honouliuli waste water were {{analyzed}} for heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Semiannual sediment {{samples from the}} old and new Sand Island ocean outfall sites were also examined for both classes of toxicants. A few supplemental samples of both waste waters were examined for EPA designated priority pollutants as part of the City and County of Honolulu effort to obtain a waiver of secondary treatment requirements for major waste water discharges. Based on the results of this work, {{there appears to be no}} significant or alarming level of the examined substances in the waste waters or sediments compared to data from the literature or from other Hawaiian waste waters and sediments. All monthly monitoring of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in the Sand Island discharge yielded values below detection limits. Thus, this discharge permit requirement is being satisfied. Project staff also assisted with on-the-job training of city laboratory personnel in the techniques necessary for heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbon analyses. Twenty-four flow-weighted composites were collected for the analysis of pesticides, metals, and base-neutral extractable compounds. Grab samples were collected for the determination of phenols, cyanides, and volatile organics. Volatile organics were not detectable by gas chromatography and further analysis by mass spectrometer was not performed. Acid extractable compounds (phenols) were not detected in all waste waters < 0. 1 µg/l). Only a few base-neutral extractables were detected. The only pesticides detected were dieldrin in the Mokapu and Waianae effluents and <b>demeton</b> in the Waianae effluent. The level of heavy metals detected was not considered significant compared to existing environmental criteria. Cyanides were, if present, below detection limits. Total phenols were not detected, except in the Sand Island sample at 6 µg/l. Overall, the levels of priority pollutants were extremely low as expected.
