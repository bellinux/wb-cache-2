Keeping in mind this objective, our paper is structured around three main sections, as follows. The first part, “Economic Context of Romania-Russian Federation Trade Development” is centered upon the global crisis and its effects on the EU, Romania and Russia as well as the EU-Russia increasing bilateral merchandise trade flows. We examine how the global economic crisis interrupted increasing merchandise trade between EU- 27 and the Russian Federation and present the main exporter countries from the EU- 27 to Russia and the major EU importers from Russia and analyze in a comparative manner the very concentrated trade pattern between EU- 27 and Russia. In the next section, “Romania-Russia Trade Development”, we underline that the Russian Federation is the second <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trading</b> partner of our country. We explore Romania’s trade relationship with Russia during pre and post accession to the European Union and also the actual trends of the bilateral trade, which pattern is extremely concentrated. In the last section, “Opportunities and Prospects for the Trade Development between Romania and Russian Federation”, we conclude, {{on the basis of the}} comparative and prospective analysis, that: Romania could be well positioned on Russian markets; there are many similarities in competitiveness characteristics of our countries; Romania and Russia have some problematic factors in doing business; strong points of the Romanian manufacturing industry could lead to the diversification of trade pattern and, finally, Romania has the possibility to develop a strong economic partnership with the Russian Federation under the framework of the EU-Russia relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1995 Austria's foreign trade {{can be divided into}} two separate areas: trade with the 14 other EU member states and trade with all other countries in the world. In 1994, intra-EU trade accounted for 65 percent of Austria's exports and 68 percent of imports. These shares exceed those of other EU member states. Thus, Austria's economy was closely linked to that of the EU through foreign trade even before accession to this group of countries. Intra-EU trade is favored vis-a-vis trade with third countries in a variety of ways: the abolishment of border controls, the elimination of variable import levies and tariffs on agricultural products and food, liberalization of public procurement, the abolishment of rules of origin and the simplification of technical provisions. Moreover, there is a tendency within the EU to impose anti-dumping tariffs on goods imported from successful competitors abroad. Suppliers from third countries are disadvantaged vis-a-vis sellers from within the EU at various levels. This {{was one of the reasons}} for Austria's decision to join the EU. In the recent past, Austria's trade with countries outside of the EU (<b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade)</b> has developed somewhat more dynamically than trade with EU countries (intra-EU trade) : in 1993 extra-EU exports rose by 3. 6 percent, while intra-EU exports declined by 7. 8 percent; in 1994 the figures were 11. 8 and 8. 4 percent. The difference can be attributed mainly to cyclical factors. After accession to the EU, Austria's intra-EU trade ought to grow faster than <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> thanks to more favorable conditions within the EU. This is likely to be the case in agricultural trade. As far as trade with manufacturing products is concerned, the impact of the improvement in trade relations might only be felt after some delay. <b>Extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> (35 percent of total exports, 32 percent of total imports) might for analytical purposes be broken down into two parts: trade with countries "associated" with the EU (the remainder of the EFTA countries, the six countries of East-Central Europe with Europe agreements, as well the ACP countries), and trade with third countries. The countries of East-Central Europe associated with the EU accounted for 26 percent of Austria's extra-EU exports and 18 percent of extra-EU imports. The EFTA countries contributed 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, to Austria's <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade.</b> From Austria's perspective, the grouping of the overseas departments (DOM/TOM, e. g., the Canary Islands, Madeira), as well as the ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region) is new. The latter group consists mainly of the former colonies of the founding members of the European Common Market. These countries enjoy special access to the markets of EU countries. At present, foreign trade with these countries is negligible, but might gain in importance in the future. Among the not associated third countries are the developing countries overseas (with a share of 22 percent in <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade)</b> and the not associated countries of Eastern Europe (8 percent). Industrialized countries overseas account for 19 percent of extra-EU exports and 33 percent of extra-EU imports. Austria's accession to the EU means that the compilation of statistics on trade with EU countries can no longer be based on data as recorded at the border but must be compiled at the firm level based on value added tax returns (Intrastat). Statistics on trade with third countries (Extrastat) will be gathered as before at the border. The changeover to the new system is creating substantial difficulties. For some time no data on foreign trade will be available; this comes at an inopportune time when the current account is turning negative. At the moment it is still unclear how the system of national accounts might be used to substitute for the foreign trade statistics.

IIT outside the EU is higher and displays a significant upward trend, whereas the extent of intra-EU IIT of Greece is generally lower and shows a decreasing trend. Comparative advantage considerations seem to determine Greece’s intra-EU and extra-EU IIT. Greece’s IIT with the CEECs is particularly low and to some extent declining.

40|$|Dual-use {{items are}} goods and {{technologies}} that have both civil and military uses. In the European Union their export is controlled and governed by an EC regulation since the year 2000. Its implementation, {{in terms of}} legislation, export authorisations and customs controls, remains the responsibility {{of each of the}} 27 Member States. For reasons linked to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, competition in trade and free market rules, it is ‘desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the EU in order to promote EU and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters’ – as stated in the regulation. How far is the goal? Hard to say since no official data about the trade of dual-use items are shared among Member States, nor with the European Commission, Directorate General Trade, in charge of the dual-use regulation. This report presents sources of generic, statistical trade data and a methodology to create an approximate picture of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> flows of dual-use items. The data stem from goods’ declarations made by exporters to customs authorities as part of the normal export process for any commodity. The data are collected at national level, aggregated by categories of goods, and made public in web data services on trade. The data are referred to a commodity classification system, the Combined Nomenclature (CN), in use for customs controls in the EU. However the CN is only indirectly related to dual-use items. Correspondence tables exist that map dual-use items to CN descriptors, but they introduce approximations in the description of the items traded. For this reason the CN trade data provide, in the general case, upper bounds to the real trade volume of dual-use items. Notwithstanding this limitation, the CN trade data may prove useful for a number of issues and assessments needed for export controls. One example is presented in this report. It concerns the estimation of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> flows for dual-use chemicals under consideration for inclusion in a Union General Export Authorisation (EU GEA). EU GEAs define a framework valid in all EU Members States whereby the export of selected categories of dual-use items to specific destination countries with a low-risk of diversion is automatically authorised. An analysis of the volume of exports based on CN trade data allows estimating the impact expected for EU exporters by including given dual-use chemicals in an EU GEA. To facilitate the estimation of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> flows, it is proposed to develop a dedicated Information Technology tool merging lists of export-controlled items with correspondence tables of CN items’ descriptors and export data. Such a tool can become a design and evaluation instrument to assess the economic impact of alternative policy options to regulate the European dual-use trade. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E

We find that Russia may have incentives to join the EU ETS as long as the latter remains separated from the Kyoto international emissions market. In this case, Russia can exert monopolistic price discrimination between two separated markets thereby maximizing revenues from hot air sales.

40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily processed products and secondary processed products. A higher ratio of processed products in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the processed products represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to gauge the main trends in the {{evolution}} and structure of the EU trade in goods, mainly after 2004, starting from a quantitative analysis and comparing trends in the trade in goods with trends in the trade in services, where necessary. We focus on the trade of the EU- 27 as a group, but we stress the differences and similarities between the old member states (EU- 15) and the new member states (NMS) as well. Structured in seven parts, the paper reveals several noteworthy conclusions. Firstly, the EU remains the world trade leader; nevertheless, its market shares have been diminishing in the recent years, both in the export and import flows, due to a complex of factors. Secondly, the NMS shares in the EU trade flows have been growing; yet, the NMS shares in the exports and imports of the EU- 27 remain at a very low level. Besides, the normalized trade balance of the NSM, compared with that of the EU- 15 underlines the different competitive advantages of the two groups. Thirdly, the trade deficit of the EU- 27 continues to deepen (the <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> deficit tripled in 2004 - 2008); however, there are significant differences between the manufactures trade balance (with large surpluses) and the commodities trade balance (with a deficit that doubled between 2004 and 2008). Fourth, the paper points out that the extra-EU exports and the imports are dominated by the manufactures; however the share of manufactures in the import flows is much smaller than that in the export flows. Finally, the present analysis traces evidence of the major impact of the global financial and economic crisis on the EU trade flows and the first signs of recovery.

40|$|In {{their first}} year of EU membership, the new EU member states {{recorded}} higher GDP growth (5 % on average) than in the previous year, largely thanks to expanding domestic demand - in particular of investment and of private consumption. In 2004 GDP growth accelerated also in Austria, in line with the EU- 15, yet both growth rates remained nearly 3 percentage points below that of the NMS. The NMS not only add a certain dynamism to the European economy but put some pressure on the EU reform agenda as well. On the downside, the situation on the NMS labour market remains precarious, robust economic growth notwithstanding. The average rate of unemployment is nearly twice as high as in the EU- 15 whereas in Austria the unemployment rate is less than half the EU average. Austria and the NMS face numerous challenges regarding labour market developments in border regions, as well as with respect to the labour market position of different skill groups of workers. Overall, the most vulnerable group of employees are those with the lowest educational levels. There are little prospects for marked improvements anytime soon. The latter refers to industry in particular, which - despite a remarkable acceleration of output growth - continues to shed labour. This implies impressive gains in labour productivity and, given the general wage restraint, in unit labour costs as well. The international cost competitiveness of NMS has recently been eroded by appreciating domestic currencies whereas Austrian productivity and cost competitiveness have been continuously improving. After a temporary increase in 2004 (largely caused by tax adjustments prior to EU accession and by rising energy prices), inflation resumed its downward trend in all NMS. The remaining inflation differential with respect to the eurozone, magnified by an appreciation tendency of NMS currencies (often stimulated by short-term capital inflows) may lead to competitiveness losses in the future. Given the ongoing productivity and quality improvements this danger is not yet imminent. Still the exchange rate developments should be watched closely, not least in the period prior to EMU accession, which in several NMS will probably extend beyond 2010. The need to reduce excessive budget deficits represents another challenge for a number of NMS in the coming years. The outstanding feature of last year's economic developments was a boost in foreign trade. NMS exports grew by more than 20 %, somewhat faster than imports (+ 17 %), and their aggregate trade balance improved slightly. Yet foreign trade contributed positively to GDP growth in Poland only (as well as in Austria). The export sector of the NMS is strengthening - not least thanks to sustained reforms and large FDI inflows {{in the past couple of}} years - and their integration in the European and world economy is increasing. In 2004, 80 % of NMS exports and 70 % of imports already represented intra-EU trade. After the takeover of EU external trade policies upon accession, especially intra-NMS trade and <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> are booming. Altogether, the NMS enjoy a surplus in trade transactions with the EU, an achievement largely attributable to the high and growing surpluses of the Czech Republic and Slovakia (and to a lower deficit in Poland). Austria¿s trade with the NMS displays above-average dynamism as well as steady surpluses in both goods and services trade. Austria's services trade has been more diverse with respect to NMS after accession. Travel services are declining in importance, while transport and other business services are on the rise. For the smaller services categories, some degree of trade diversion away from partners in the old EU to NMS can be observed. Trade with the EU may have had a positive effect on GDP growth in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia in the first year of accession; the GDP growth effect of trade with the NMS was positive for Austria as well. The EU's enlargement of May 2004 has brought few surprises and may generally be considered a success. The accession of the NMS was well prepared and managed. Earlier estimates of enlargement effects as a 'win-win situation' for both 'old' and 'new' member states seem to be confirmed. Still, the direct economic effects of accession on the NMS are difficult to identify economic growth, especially of industry, had speeded up already before May 2004, a temporary increase of inflation was successfully contained and domestic currencies strengthened. Net transfers from the EU budget were negligible, yet foreign trade expanded strongly and inflows of FDI picked up again. The GDP growth outlook is fairly robust barring major external shocks, the NMS are expected to grow by 4 - 5 % annually in the coming years (the Baltic States will continue to enjoy even somewhat higher growth) thus maintaining their speed of convergence to the 'old' EU. The shadow side of this fairly upbeat economic forecast is the labour market where no substantial reduction of unemployment is expected. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia (all already participating in the ERM II) may adopt the euro in late 2006 or early 2007, with the remaining 'high-deficit' NMS following suit during 2008 - 2010. regional economic development, regional employment, structural change, regional disparities...|$|E

International trade theorists have {{always been interested in}} the relevance of quality of goods for the direction and pattern of bilateral trade flows (e. g., Hummels and Klenow (AER 2004)). Recently several studies have developed empirical tools for estimating the relationship between quality and bilateral trade. This literature shows that both supply side effects (e. g., Schott (QJE 2004)) and demand side effects (e. g., Hallak (JIE 2005)) matter as determinants for the quality of international trade. In this paper we investigate the determinants of the quality of goods traded by the European Union by using several panel data econometric techniques. Both intra-EU and <b>extra-EU</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> flows are considered at a detailed sectoral level. These empirical findings are based on the estimation of an integrated framework which combines both supply and demand side effects. This theoretical framework is an original approach to the existing literature. According to the literature several factors may influence the relationship between quality and trade. In this paper we focus on the role of technological innovation in particular. In addition to technological innovation it appears that technological spillovers play a major role for the quality of European exports. Nevertheless the importance of technological spillovers depends on the location {{and the size of the}} exporting EU countries. Moreover major sectoral and geographical differences are found.

Our findings suggest that {{it is not easy to}} reach a common conclusion about the whole chemical industry. Overall costs compare more favourably among countries than initially thought in the case of processes producing co-products, but maybe less favourably when processes are without co-products. The European industry has lower production costs than the industries in the other countries in the case of ethylene and propylene, but higher in the case of ammonia and methanol.

40|$|The {{external}} conditions facing the transition economies slightly improved on balance {{during the year}} 2004. The eight new EU member states of Central and Eastern Europe (NMS- 8) recorded higher GDP growth (5 % on average) {{than in the previous}} year, largely thanks to expanding domestic demand - in particular of investment (Czech Republic, Hungary and Latvia) and of private consumption (Poland, Slovakia, Estonia and Lithuania). Growth accelerated also in Southeast Europe (except Croatia and Macedonia), as well as in Belarus and Ukraine (Russia's GDP grew by 7 % again). The transition economies have thus {{been one of the most}} dynamic regions in the world. The NMS have been growing more than 2 percentage points faster than the 'old' EU- 15. These countries not only add a certain dynamism to the European economy but put some pressure on the EU reform agenda as well. On the downside, the situation on the labour market remains precarious, robust economic growth notwithstanding. The average rate of unemployment in the NMS is nearly twice as high as in the EU- 15 (mainly on account of Poland and Slovakia); in most of Southeast Europe it is even higher, with little prospect for marked improvements any time soon. The latter refers to industry in particular, which - despite a remarkable acceleration of output growth (10 % on NMS average in 2004) - continues to shed labour. This implies impressive gains in labour productivity and, given the general wage restraint, in unit labour costs as well. The improving international costs competitiveness of NMS has recently been eroded by appreciating domestic currencies (Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). After a temporary increase in 2004 (largely caused by tax adjustments prior to EU accession and rising energy prices), inflation resumed its downward trend, reaching low single digits in most NMS (except Slovakia) and in the remaining transition countries as well (except Romania, Serbia and Ukraine). Russian inflation has been stubbornly high, fuelled by large inflows of foreign currency, tariff hikes and galloping producer prices. The remaining inflation differential with respect to the eurozone, magnified by a natural appreciation tendency of NMS currencies (frequently stimulated by short-term capital inflows) may lead to competitiveness losses in the future. Given the ongoing productivity and quality improvements this danger is not imminent in most NMS yet. Still the exchange rate developments should be watched closely, not least in the period prior to EMU accession, which in several NMS will probably extend beyond 2010. The need to reduce excessive budget deficits represents another challenge facing several NMS in the coming years. The outstanding feature of last year's economic developments was a boost in foreign trade (or of intra-EU dispatches and arrivals in the case of NMS). NMS exports jumped by more than 20 % in current euro terms, somewhat faster than imports (+ 18 %), yet their aggregate trade balance slightly deteriorated (in fact foreign trade contributed positively to GDP growth in Poland only). Nonetheless, the export sector of NMS is strengthening - not least thanks to sustained reforms and large FDI inflows in the past few years - and their integration in the European and world economy is increasing. Today, 86 % of NMS exports and 72 % of imports represent intra-EU trade. Given the high (and rising) export surpluses of Russia and Ukraine - in both cases swelled by rising world market commodity prices - the trade contribution to growth has been positive in these countries as well. After the takeover of EU external trade policies upon accession, especially intra-NMS trade (preliminary estimates suggest an increase by 30 % in 2004) and <b>extra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> are booming. Altogether, the NMS enjoy a surplus in trade transactions with the EU, an achievement attributable largely to the high and growing surpluses of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia (and to a lower deficit in Poland); the separate effect of trade with the EU on GDP growth was most likely positive. In Southeast Europe, trade integration is (with few exceptions such as Bulgaria) still rather low and many countries in the region suffer from huge trade and current account deficits which may not be sustainable (particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia). The EU accession of eight Central and East European countries on 1 May 2004 has brought few surprises and may generally be considered a success. The accession was well prepared and managed. The direct economic effects of accession on the NMS are difficult to identify economic growth, especially of industry, had speeded up already before May 2004, a temporary increase of inflation was soon successfully contained and domestic currencies strengthened. Net transfers from the EU budget were negligible (less than 1 % of NMS GDP), yet inflows of FDI picked up in 2004 again - albeit remaining below the peak of 2000 - 2002. The GDP growth outlook is fairly robust barring major external shocks, the NMS are expected to grow by 4 - 5 % annually in the coming years (the Baltic States will continue to enjoy even somewhat higher growth) thus maintaining their speed of nominal and real convergence to the 'old' EU. Inflation is converging to eurozone levels as well. The shadow side of this fairly upbeat forecast is the labour market where no substantial reduction of unemployment is expected. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia (all already participating in the ERM II) may adopt the euro in late 2006 or early 2007, with the remaining 'high-deficit' NMS following suit during 2008 - 2010. Also the economic outlook for Southeast Europe is more encouraging now than in the recent past GDP growth will accelerate in most countries (without recurring inflation), but unemployment will remain high. As far as the integration prospects of this region are concerned, Bulgaria and Romania will become EU members in 2007, followed by Croatia in 2008 and with Macedonia the next candidate. The coming two years will be crucial also for the remaining countries of the Western Balkans as a number of exceptionally difficult issues will have to be solved (in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo). If everything goes well (and there are a lot of caveats) the whole region could be in the EU around 2015. However, by that time the issue of Turkey's EU membership will have to be finally decided and a possible application of Ukraine (as well as Moldova) for EU membership will have to be dealt with. In addition, the enlarged EU will simultaneously have to clarify its relations with Russia. These challenging developments will doubtlessly require a new (and this time much more radical) reform of the whole system of EU institutions.

40|$|AbstractOur study compares {{chemical}} {{production costs}} in the European Union (EU) and other countries {{in order to understand}} whether these costs are higher in the case of Europe than in other countries. Our analysis focuses on ammonia, methanol and light olefins (ethylene and propylene), as all of them are considered chemical compounds produced in large scale. The countries selected for comparison are USA, Russia, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia, since they have high shares of <b>extra-EU</b> 28 <b>trade</b> and/or the global installed capacity of the selected products. A bottom-up approach (based on information at facility level) has been followed, including 116, 29, 122 and 224 facilities producing ammonia, methanol, ethylene and propylene respectively. Taking into consideration the complex differences in technologies and co-products between operators, costs are broken down to six components: (1) feedstock, (2) credits (due to co-products), (3) electricity, (4) thermal energy 5) other materials (chemicals, catalysts etc.) and (6) labour and other costs (salaries, overheads etc.). Our findings suggest that {{it is not easy to}} reach a common conclusion about the whole chemical industry. Overall costs compare more favourably among countries than initially thought in the case of processes producing co-products, but maybe less favourably when processes are without co-products. The European industry has lower production costs than the industries in the other countries in the case of ethylene and propylene, but higher in the case of ammonia and methanol. Feedstock costs play the most important role in the total production costs of all four products, but the presence of credits due to by-products could change the behaviour of the total costs...|$|R
