5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set naming system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the <b>given</b> <b>name</b> for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the <b>given</b> <b>name</b> for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E

5|$|The word Mahatma, while often {{mistaken for}} Gandhi's <b>given</b> <b>name</b> in the West, {{is taken from}} the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul).

25|$|Ethiopians have a {{different}} naming system to the family name-based Western system. Children add the given names of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own <b>given</b> <b>name.</b> For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's <b>given</b> <b>name</b> is taken as a family surname, and a person's <b>given</b> <b>name</b> and his/her father's <b>given</b> <b>name</b> form the first name.|$|E

25|$|Many Nuer {{have been}} exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a <b>given</b> <b>name</b> and always in Nuer.

Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves.|$|E
25|$|A {{specific}} pattern developed among {{the descendants of}} 20th-century immigrants: they use only their father's surname and two given names, {{the first is a}} Portuguese <b>given</b> <b>name</b> and the second one is a <b>given</b> <b>name</b> from their father's original country.|$|E
25|$|In a {{situation}} where two {{people do not have}} the same status, for example an employer and employee, a subordinate person is addressed by his or her <b>given</b> <b>name</b> by their superior, but the subordinate never uses the <b>given</b> <b>name</b> of the superior, using his or her title instead.|$|E
50|$|Russian <b>given</b> <b>names</b> are {{provided}} at birth or selected during a name change. Orthodox Christian names constitute a fair proportion of Russian <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> {{but there are}} many exceptions including pre-Christian Slavic names, Communist names, and names taken from ethnic minorities in Russia. <b>Given</b> <b>names</b> form a distinct area of the Russian language with some unique features.|$|R
5000|$|Compound <b>given</b> <b>names</b> are uncommon, {{with only}} one notable exception, i.e. Ana-Maria (sometimes spelled Anamaria). In that case this is not {{considered}} to be two separate <b>given</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some {{surnames}} {{are equal}} to <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> such as Joana Fernando, or André João, in which [...] "Fernando" [...] and [...] "João" [...] are surnames, not <b>given</b> <b>names.</b> It is rather improbable {{that those are}} patronymics; more likely they originated with people with no surnames, who were <b>given</b> two <b>names</b> {{for the sake of}} enhanced individuality. One can find today in Portugal and Brazil people who still use surnames that for other people are just <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> although they were passed from parents to sons for generations, such as Valentim, Alexandre, Fernando, Afonso (note the family name de Melo Afonso) and Antonio (note de Melo Antonio). Names like Dinis, Duarte, Garcia and Godinho were originally <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> but today they are used in Brazil almost exclusively as surnames, although Duarte and Dinis are still common <b>given</b> <b>names</b> in Portugal.|$|R
25|$|A Korean name {{consists}} of a family name followed by a <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> as used by the Korean people in both South Korea and North Korea. In the Korean language, ireum or seongmyeong usually refers to the family name (seong) and <b>given</b> <b>name</b> (ireum in a narrow sense) together.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{generation}} of settlers, Koryo-saram tended to abandon traditional Korean naming practices and follow Russian naming patterns, using a Russian <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> Russian-style patronymic (derived from the father's name, regardless of whether his name was Russian or Korean), and Korean surname. Succeeding generations tended to have both a Russian <b>given</b> <b>name</b> and a Russian patronymic. This differs from the pattern typical in the US, where Korean American parents often register their children with a Korean <b>given</b> <b>name</b> as their legal middle name (e.g. Daniel Dae Kim, Harold Hongju Koh).|$|E
25|$|Either the surname or the <b>given</b> <b>name</b> {{may come}} first in {{different}} contexts; {{in newspapers and}} in informal uses, the order is <b>given</b> <b>name</b> + surname, while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.|$|E
5000|$|Seventeen baby girls born in 2009 in the United States were <b>given</b> the <b>name</b> Renesme or Renesmee. The name rose in {{popularity}} for American girls the following year, when forty-seven girls were named Renesmee in 2010 in the United States {{and an additional}} eight girls were named Renesme. It dropped slightly in 2011, when thirty-three American girls born that year were <b>given</b> the <b>name</b> Renesmee and another five girls were <b>given</b> the <b>name</b> Renesme. In 2012, 59 American girls were <b>given</b> the <b>name</b> Renesmee and in 2013, the name rose again {{in popularity}}, when 135 American girls received the name. In 2013, an additional 17 American girls were <b>given</b> the <b>name</b> with its variant spelling Renesme.

5000|$|<b>Given</b> <b>names</b> {{or first}} names among Bosniaks have mostly Arabic, or Turkish, roots such as Osman, Mehmed, Muhamed, Alija, Kemal, Mustafa, Husein, Sulejman, Mahir, Enver, and many others. South Slavic <b>given</b> <b>names</b> such as [...] "Zlatan" [...] or [...] "Zlatko" [...] are also present {{primarily}} among non-religious Bosniaks. What is notable however is {{that due to}} the structure of the Bosnian language, many of the Muslim <b>given</b> <b>names</b> have been altered to create uniquely Bosniak <b>given</b> <b>names.</b> Some of the Oriental <b>given</b> <b>names</b> have been shortened. For example: Huso short for Husein, Ahmo short for Ahmed, Meho short for Mehmed. One example of this is that of the Bosniak humorous characters Mujo and Suljo, whose <b>given</b> <b>names</b> are actually Bosniak short forms of Mustafa and Sulejman. More present still is the transformation of <b>given</b> <b>names</b> that in Arabic or Turkish are confined to one gender to apply to the other sex. In Bosnian, simply taking away the letter [...] "a" [...] changes the traditionally feminine [...] "Jasmina" [...] into the popular male name [...] "Jasmin". Similarly, adding an [...] "a" [...] to the typically male [...] "Mahir" [...] results in the feminine [...] "Mahira".|$|R
25|$|Brazilians living {{far from}} the big cities or lower-class people are prone to create new <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> joining {{together}} the <b>given</b> <b>names</b> of the parents or classical <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> changing the spelling of foreign names or even using foreign suffixes that – they may believe – give a sophisticated or modern sound to the new name (e.g. Maurren – from Maureen -, Deivid – from David, Robisson).|$|R

50|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{the most}} popular <b>given</b> <b>names</b> were Mary and either John or William for girls and boys, respectively. Throughout the Early Modern period, the {{variation}} of <b>given</b> <b>names</b> was comparatively small; the three most frequent male <b>given</b> <b>names</b> accounted for close to 50% of male population throughout this period. For example, of the boys born in London in the year 1510, 24.4% were named John, 13.3% were named Thomas and 11.7% were named William. A trend towards more diversity in <b>given</b> <b>names</b> began in the mid-19th century, and by 1900, 22.9% of the newborn boys, and 16.2% of the newborn girls in the UK shared the top three <b>given</b> <b>names.</b> The trend continued during the 20th century, and by 1994, these figures had fallen to 11% and 8.6%, respectively. This trend {{is a result of}} a combination of greater individualism in the choice of names, and the increasing ethnic heterogeneity of UK population, which led to a wider range of frequent <b>given</b> <b>names</b> from non-European traditions.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the ancient}} Romans {{had a very}} limited stock of <b>given</b> <b>names</b> (praenomina), very few modern Italian <b>given</b> <b>names</b> (nomi) are derived {{directly}} from the classical ones. A rare example would be Marco (from Marcus).|$|R
25|$|Mongolians {{do not use}} {{surnames}} in the {{way that}} most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics – then called ovog, now called etsgiin ner – are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the <b>given</b> <b>name.</b> Therefore, if a man with <b>given</b> <b>name</b> Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in genitive case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial – Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their <b>given</b> <b>name</b> (Elbegdorj guai – Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.|$|E
