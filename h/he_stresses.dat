5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. <b>He</b> <b>stresses</b> that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

25|$|McKay is also {{passionate about}} amateur science; <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> {{important}} contributions that amateurs {{have made to}} the scientific enterprise, and even considers himself a professional in a few fields and an amateur in many. McKay believes that science {{is not just about}} uncovering new knowledge for experts, but also about spreading that knowledge to as many people as possible.|$|E
25|$|According to , the violently anti-Huguenot city of Paris {{was really}} responsible. <b>He</b> <b>stresses</b> {{that the city}} {{was on the verge of}} revolt. The Guises, who were highly popular, {{exploited}} this situation to put pressure on the King and the Queen Mother. Charles IX was thus forced to head off the potential riot, which was the work of the Guises, the city militia and the common people.|$|E
25|$|Gladwell often {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of holism to unconscious intelligence, meaning that it considers the situation as a whole. At the same time, <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> that unconscious intelligence relies on finding simple underlying patterns. However, only when a situation is overwhelmingly determined by one or a few interacting factors is holism consistent with simple underlying signatures. In many situations, holism and simple underlying signatures pull in different directions.|$|E

500|$|Against {{traditional}} theism, Cobb {{has also}} denied {{the idea that}} God is immutable (unchanging) and impassible (unfeeling). [...] Instead, <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> that God is affected and changed {{by the actions of}} creatures, both human and otherwise. [...] For Cobb, the idea that God experiences and changes does not mean that God is imperfect—quite the contrary. [...] Instead, God is seen as experiencing with all beings, and hence understanding and empathizing with all beings, becoming [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands." [...] Cobb argues that this idea of God is more compatible with the Bible, in which Jesus suffers and dies.|$|E
500|$|Historian J. Birkenmeier has {{recently}} argued that John's reign {{was the most}} successful of the Komnenian period. In [...] "The development of the Komnenian army 1081–1180", <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> the wisdom of John's approach to warfare, which focused on siege warfare rather than risky pitched battles. Birkenmeier argues that John's strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited, realistic objectives was a more sensible one than that followed by his son Manuel I. According to this view, John's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire's heartland from attack while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor. The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Western Emperor against the Normans of Sicily.|$|E
500|$|Although Vaughan {{has written}} for television, and has {{endeavored}} to have his previous works adapted into film, <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book {{and not to be}} adapted to other media, explaining [...] "I wanted to do something that was way too expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown-up to be a four-quadrant blockbuster." [...] Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead, having written the first six issues as the first story arc, which would have ended with the two main characters dying on the rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful. By June 2016, Vaughan indicated that he knew what the last page of the series' final issue would be.|$|E

500|$|More {{than any}} other song on the entire studio album, the epic stadium-rap power ballad [...] "I Wonder" [...] was the most {{influenced}} by U2. Kanye West cites {{it as one of}} this top three most favorite songs from Graduation. Kanye imparted that he had sought out to make the hip-hop variation of the rock band's [...] "City of Blinding Lights". West reportedly heard the snare drum which was used for the track while shopping for furniture at Moss and spent many weeks working on it. Kanye has also said that he wrote the song while thinking of performing it onstage {{in front of an audience}} of over 50,000 people. With this in mind, he placed a significant amount of concentration on speaking at high volumes with fewer wording and initially delivers his defiant lyrics in an intense staccato vocal style. West raps the song's three verses using single and double-time rhyme schemes. <b>He</b> <b>stresses</b> each syllable in each word in the minimalist first verse. West then transitions to a faster, more fluid flow for the more intricate second and third verses. West considered the release of [...] "I Wonder" [...] as the album's fourth single. But he instead chose [...] "Flashing Lights", which he refers to as the [...] "coolest" [...] track from the studio album.|$|E
500|$|Life in Hell {{caught the}} eye of Hollywood writer-{{producer}} and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks, who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project, which {{would turn out to be}} developing a series of short animated skits, called [...] "bumpers," [...] for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Groening feared that he would have to give up his ownership rights, and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it. Groening conceived of the idea for The Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family: Homer, the overweight father; Marge, the slim mother; Bart, the bratty oldest child; Lisa, the intelligent middle child; and Maggie, the baby. Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name [...] "Bart," [...] an anagram of brat. However, <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons. Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark [...] "is the actual inspiration for Bart." ...|$|E
500|$|Six months later, {{a race of}} villainous robots {{known as}} the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he {{scatters}} them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where six years have passed and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device {{to return to his}} friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, the Blue Typhoon. On the Typhoon, they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and [...] "Planet Eggs" [...] (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.) [...] At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metered independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an unwitting spy ever since. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely destroy her sight and hearing forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> {{to find a way to}} remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.|$|E

In 1986 Bloom combined the concepts of apoptosis, parallel distributed processing, group selection, and the superorganism to produce a theory of how collective intelligence works. Later he showed how the collective intelligences of competing bacterial colonies and human societies can be explained in terms of computer-generated [...] "complex adaptive systems" [...] and the [...] "genetic algorithms", concepts pioneered by John Holland.|$|E
2500|$|However, this {{portrait}} {{does not fit}} with {{the description of the}} painting in the historical records: Both Giorgio Vasari [...] and Gian Paolo Lomazzo describe the subject as smiling; the subject in Cotte’s portrait displays no smile. In addition, the portrait lacks the flanking columns drawn by Raphael in his c.1504 sketch of Mona Lisa. Moreover, Cotte admits that his reconstitution had been carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered a real painting; <b>he</b> <b>stresses</b> that the images never existed. Kemp is also adamant that Cotte’s images in no way establish the existence of a separate underlying portrait.|$|E
