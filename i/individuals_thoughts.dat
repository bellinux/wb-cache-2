AAT is a communication theory that emphasizes {{psychological and social}} influences on human action. The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior-how an <b>individuals</b> <b>thoughts</b> get transformed into action. According to the psychology wiki, AAT describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, {{and the organization of}} these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. For example, assembly is considered a top-to-bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to a more specific idea about communicating the specific message.|$|E
5000|$|In the study, [...] "Implicit and Explicit Consequences of Exposure to Violent and Misogynous Rap Music", {{researchers}} Rudman and Lee {{explored the}} consequences of rap music on everyday life and how it affected <b>individuals</b> <b>thoughts</b> and actions in regards to black people. The researchers begin by stating information conducted by previous research that explained, [...] "subjects exposed to violent rap music {{were less likely to}} hire a Black applicant for a job that required intelligence (whereas a White applicant was not discriminated against), suggesting that priming one aspect of the Black stereotype (violent) increases the accessibility of related stereotypic traits" [...] (unintelligent; Macrae, Stangor, & Milne, 1994). With this previous research, Rudman and Lee wanted to provide information on how our actions are primed because of hostile rap music. They did so by exposing their subjects to either rap or popular mainstream music and then provided them with a questionnaire that assessed how they explicitly and implicitly viewed Black men. The researchers hypothesized that, [...] "Because we predicted that violent and misogynistic rap music would temporarily activate associations between Black men and negative attributes (e.g. hostile, violent, sexist), while simultaneously deactivating associations between Black men and positive attributes (e.g. calm, lawful, trustworthy) we used these attributes in our stereotype IAT" [...] (Rudman, Lee). Rudman and Lee then completed an experiment on 30 men that [...] "tested the assumption that violent and misogynistic rap music would activate automatic Black stereotypes in high and low prejudiced subjects alike (Devine, 1989). Subjects were exposed to either rap or popular music and their stereotypes regarding Black men were then assessed, both implicitly and explicitly. It was expected that rap music subjects' stereotype IAT scores would be higher, relative to controls. Explicit stereotypes were also obtained for comparison purposes" [...] (Rudman, Lee). After listening to the explicit and profane music, the subjects completed the IAT test which resulted in the following: [...] "Overall, subjects showed a strong tendency to associate Blacks with negative attributes and Whites with positive attributes. That is, subjects who performed the Black + negative task first were somewhat more likely to show automatic stereotyping, compared with subjects who performed the White + negative task first" [...] (Rudman, Lee). The researchers concluded that, [...] "Thus, exposure to violent and misogynistic rap music had the generalized effect of strengthening the association between Black men and negative attributes (e.g. hostile, criminal, sexist) and decreasing the association between Black men and positive attributes (e.g. calm, trustworthy, polite)" [...] (Rudmand, Lee).|$|E
40|$|Seventy-one {{subjects}} with {{various levels of}} drinking experience completed a computerized semantic priming task. Prime phrases (describing positive outcomes of drinking alcohol or neutral phrases) were presented immediately before a target word (either alcohol-related or not). The results replicated earlier basic research examining the effects of semantically related primes on the processing of subsequent words. Furthermore, the results provided evidence that, for heavy drinking subjects, the presentation of phrases describing positive drinking outcomes significantly primed, or facilitated, responses to the alcohol-related words. These {{results are consistent with}} the view that for some <b>individuals,</b> <b>thoughts</b> about certain outcomes automatically prime, or make accessible, concepts related to alcohol use. An increase in the accessibility of these concepts has important implications for behavioral decisions about alcohol consumption...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{makes an}} effort to present, analyze and discuss the subject of religious dialogue and individuals who participate in activities surrounding it. The result is presented with data regarding the demographic variables of participants, {{as well as the}} qualitative such as interviews showing <b>individuals</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the meaning of religious dialogue. The theoretical approach includes thoughts from Gordon Lynch, Peter Berger and Tomas Luckmann as well as Ole Riis and Linda Woodhead have been important talking about the sacred form, realities and models for explaining community, symbol and agent relationships that are applicable in this thesis paper as well as Abby Days concept of believing in belonging. The conclusion that has been reached is that religious dialogue in itself is not a sacred form although individuals expressed their participation as part of their personal religious goals and the survey found a large norm among the informants around the dialogue as well as learning, about religion, other people and their perception of reality. Respondents also generally lived in Gothenburg and were over 30 years old, more women than men answered the survey and the interviews were four with two men and two women participating...|$|E
40|$|Ao {{considerar}} o conhecimento científico como uma forma de pensamento simbólico, entende-se com isso não simples sistemas de signos, mas conteúdos de pensamento (expressos por conceitos) ligados entre si e que fazem sentido, que são, no espaço das representações mentais, os substitutos do "dado objetivo" que se supõe subjazer à experiência que fazemos do "mundo" pelos sentidos e, nesse nível indissociavelmente, pelo entendimento. Esse pensamento simbólico adquire densidade e consistência pela "tecelagem" realizada graças ao trabalho dos pensamentos individuais que se comunicam, social e culturalmente, inscritos no tempo da história. Da tensão dinâmica entre o sujeito do conhecimento, que busca a inteligibilidade (pela operação de sua razão), e a objetividade dos conteúdos que ele se propõe (inicialmente dados, depois modificados ou produzidos), resulta o movimento do pensamento científico e a transformação dos conhecimentos. Esse trabalho do pensamento simbólico é marcado por um estilo próprio a cada um, mas que em parte pode ser comum em contextos, escolas ou tradições. Em ciência e em história das ciências, o estilo intervém em dois níveis: o da abordagem "objetal" da produção das obras pelos cientistas e o da abordagem "reflexiva" da história epistemológica e da filosofia, que se interrogam sobre a significação tanto dos próprios conteúdos de conhecimento quanto do pensamento racional, simbólico, cuja função é manifestá-los. By considering {{scientific knowledge}} {{as a form}} of symbolic thought, we do not mean by the latter simply systems of signs, but thought contents (expressed by concepts) related between them and providing meaning; they are, in the space of mental representations, the substitutes of the «objectively given» that one supposes to underly the experience of the «world» done through the senses and the understanding, both being indissociable at this level. This symbolic thought gets density and consistence in the «weaving» that is made, through the work of the <b>individuals</b> <b>thoughts</b> put together in social and cultural communication, and immersed in the time of history. The dynamical tension between the subject of knowledge, who is looking for intelligibility (by the operations of his reasoning), and the objectivity he aims at of the knowledge contents (first given to him, and then modified or renewed by him), produces as an effect the movement of scientific thought and the transformations of knowledge. This work of the symbolic thought is characterized by a style proper to each acting subject, but which may exhibit some common features in given contexts, schools or traditions. In science and in history of science, style intervenes at two levels : that one of the « objectal » approach of the production of works by scientists, and that one of the « reflexive » approach by epistemological history and by philosophy, which inquire about the meaning of the knowledge contents themselves as well as about that of the rational, symbolic, thought whose function is to bring them to light...|$|E
