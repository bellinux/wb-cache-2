50|$|The main {{internetwork}} layer protocol is PUP, which roughly {{corresponds to}} the Internet Protocol (IP) layer in TCP/IP. A full PUP network address consists of an 8-bit network number, an 8-bit <b>host</b> <b>number,</b> and a 16-bit socket number. The network number has a particular special value which means 'this network', for use by hosts which do not (yet) know their network number.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{development}} of the Internet Protocol, network administrators interpreted an IP address in two parts: network number portion and <b>host</b> <b>number</b> portion. The highest order octet (most significant eight bits) in an address was designated as the network number and the remaining bits were called the rest field or host identifier and were used for host numbering within a network.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{port number}} {{was not yet}} used at this time. It was preceded {{by the use of}} the term socket number in the early {{development}} stages of the network.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} natural and anthropogenic habitat disturbance {{on the structure of}} invertebrate communities living on two species of Heliconia herbs. We compared the invertebrate community structure associated to both species growing in natural forest gaps, on road edges for H. latispatha, and in riparian vegetation for H. collinsiana. We assessed the topological structure of individual-based Heliconia–invertebrate networks. Species richness was greater in H. collinsiana inhabiting riparian vegetation but no differences were found in the diversity of invertebrates for any Heliconia species and habitat. Invertebrate abundance was greater in gaps for H. latispatha and in riparian vegetation for H. collinsiana showing a species turnover in human disturbed habitats. The invertebrate community was not randomly assembled but highly nested, revealing a structured pattern for all habitat conditions. Heliconia–invertebrate network properties appear to be maintained in human disturbed habitats, despite differences in species richness, abundance and composition and <b>host</b> <b>number</b> and quality. Our study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} structure of ecological interactions in contrasting habitats. Because they provide food and habitat for the associated fauna and several microhabitats for colonization, heliconias could be used as habitat elements for invertebrate conservation in human impacted landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{possible}} {{coexistence of}} one host, one aggressive parasite and one non-lethal parasite is simulated using the Penna model of biological ageing. If the aggressive parasites survive the difficult initial times {{where they have}} to adjust genetically to the proper host age, all three species may survive, though the <b>host</b> <b>number</b> may be diminished by increasing parasite aggressivity. Simulations of more diversified conditions considering more than two parasite species underline the importance of synchronization for long term survival. Keywords: PENNA MODEL, EVOLUTION, EMERGENCE. The extinction of biological population is an extreme event (Albeverio et al 2006) and in an ageing simulation like the Penna model can be due to random fluctuations for small populations (Pal 1996) or due to unfavourable conditions for large populations (Malarz 2007). We had earlier applied these computer simulation methods to one host species and one parasite species, where the parasite needs to attack the host at one specific age of the host (Stauffer et al. 2007). Now we generalise this simulation to two parasite species, and assume that one of them also kills the host with some probability and the other (non-lethal) parasite with some other probability (Lampe 1984). All these simulations were based on the at present most commonly use...|$|E
