5|$|The DMT {{group is}} removed with a {{solution}} of an acid, such as 2% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA), in an inert solvent (dichloromethane or toluene). The orange-colored DMT cation formed is washed out; the step results in the solid support-bound oligonucleotide precursor bearing a free 5'-terminal <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of a}} <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
40|$|High {{spinning}} speed H- 1 magic-angle spinning {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (1 H MAS NMR) was used to detect surface <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of diatomite, which include isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> and hydrogen-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> and water adsorbed on diatomite surface that include pore water and hydrogen-bonded water. The corresponding proton chemical shifts of above species are ca. 2. 0, 6. 0 - 7. 1, 4. 9 and 3. 0 respectively. Accompanied by thermal treatment temperature ascending, the pore water and hydrogen-bonded water are desorbed successively. As a result, the relative intensities of the peaks assigned to protons of isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> and hydrogen-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> increase gradually and reach their maxima at 1000 degreesC. After 1100 degreesC calcination, the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> that classified to strongly hydrogen-bonded ones and the Isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> condense basically. But some weakly hydrogen-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> may still persist In the micropores...|$|R

5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Polysaccharides and glycans {{are made}} by the {{sequential}} addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures. The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
40|$|Using DRIFT spectroscopy, we {{detected}} surface hydroxyl {{structure of}} diatomite in this study. There were either isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> or H-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> {{on the surface}} of the diatomite. At room temperature, the diatomite surface was predominantly covered by weakly adsorbed water in cavity and water bonded to surface <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> via H-bonds. There appeared a broad band with middle wavenumber at 3 400 - 3 500 cm(- 1) as a result in the corresponding DRIFT spectra. With driving off adsorbed water by heating the sample from 200 degreesC to 1000 degreesC, the broad band fade away gradually, and a single band at about 3 745 cm(- 1), which is attributed to both isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> and partial H-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> became more and more intense with increasing temperature. Under the heat treatment conditions of 1 100 degreesC for one hour, the isolated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> were mostly desorbed from the surface, and the H-bonded <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> that existed above the inner wall of micropores with diameter of circa 10 nm, however, had not yet condensed thoroughly. The thermal behavior was supposed to be a speciality of diatomite...|$|R

50|$|The main <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> in lignin are {{aliphatic}} (R-OH), phenolic (Ph-OH) and {{carboxylic acid}} (R-COOH) <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups.</b> Phenolic <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) structures and C5-substituted (ie. having β-5, 4-O-5 and 5-5 inter-unit linkages) structures. The <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> may {{be determined by}} 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In such a determination, the lignin sample is dissolved using a mixture of DMF and pyridine (in excess for a quantitative reaction), {{in the presence of}} an internal standard (IS) and a relaxation reagent (RR), and then phosphitylated using a mixture of a derivatisation regent (DR) and deuterated chloroform. The phosphitylated sample is then scanned using liquide state 31P-NMR spectroscopy and the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are quantified by integration of the corresponding signals from obtained 31P-NMR spectra.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E
30|$|The {{chemical}} routes used {{to transform}} glycerin include selective oxidation, etherification, dehydration, hydrogenolysis, and reforming [23],[34]-[37]. In the selective oxidation, the oxidation of primary <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> yields glyceric acid and tartronic acid, {{both of which}} are commercially useful compounds. Dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an important fine chemical, is obtained from the oxidation of the secondary <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> while ketomalonic (or mesoxalic) acid results when all three <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are oxidized [34],[38].|$|R
30|$|The {{hydrophilic}} silica nanoparticles {{could be}} more effective than the hydrophobic ones in reducing adsorption onto carbonate samples, because there are more <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> in hydrophilic silica nanoparticles than in hydrophobic silica particles. Owing to this fact, more hydrogen bonds exist between <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> and the tail of the ionic surfactant, while more electrostatic bonds are formed between <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of silica nanoparticles and positively charged rock surfaces are also observed.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} and reactivity {{of the different}} hydroxyl species {{on the surface of}} silica gel are studied using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with photo-acoustic detection and chemical modification with trichlorosilane. The effect of the porosity is investigated using three types of silica gel with different pore distributions. The number of free and bridged <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> on the surface of silica gel and their reactivity towards trichlorosilane is quantitatively assessed. It is concluded that smaller pore radii favour the condensation of bridged <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> to free ones with increasing pretreatment temperature. Trichlorosilane reacts exclusively with free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> at high pretreatment temperatures, and partially with bridged <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> at low pretreatment temperatures. The reactivity of the free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> is not affected by the pore radius, whereas the bridged hydroxyls become less reactive towards trichlorosilane as the pore radius decreases...|$|R
5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group</b> to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>group.</b> One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of {{the reaction of the}} sulphuryl chloride-N, N-dimethyl formamide reagent with several carbohydrate compounds, containing free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> was undertaken, mainly with the view of looking at substitution of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> with chlorine atoms. The reaction was found to lead to substitution of both primary and secondary <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> with chlorine, with inversion of configuration in the latter case. The reagent was further found to effect formylation and chlorosulphation of secondary <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups,</b> where nucleophilic substitution by a chlorine was not favourable. Studies involving the methyl pentopyranosides, showed that the reagent was particularly useful in the chlorosulphation and chlorination of sugars, compared with the hexopyranosides...|$|R
50|$|Different {{kinds of}} methyl {{cellulose}} {{can be prepared}} depending {{on the number of}} <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> substituted. Cellulose is a polymer consisting of numerous linked glucose molecules, each of which exposes three <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The Degree of Substitution (DS) of a given form of methyl cellulose is defined as the average number of substituted <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> per glucose. The theoretical maximum is thus a DS of 3.0, however more typical values are 1.3-2.6.|$|R
50|$|Wrinkles form {{in cotton}} fabrics {{due to the}} free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups.</b> Cotton {{is a form of}} {{cellulose}} chains linked to form firm three-dimensional structures that offer both tensile strength and flexibility due to their carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond based backbone. Since cellulose is composed of glucose units, cyclic carbohydrate molecules, cellulose has free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> (-OH) projecting from each monomeric subunit. These <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> tend form hydrogen-bonds to neighboring <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups.</b> When the fabric is stressed either by heat or pressure, the original hydrogen bonds in the cotton fabric break and reform with nearby atoms at random. This re-forming of the hydrogen bonds, known as cross linking, is the reason for wrinkles, or creases, in the fabric. DMEU works to prevent these wrinkles by covalently bonding to two free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> in the fabric through a dehydration reaction that is not as easily broken as the hydrogen bond before treatment.|$|R

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of mono- and multi-coordinated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> on Pt/ZrO 2 with CO was investigated with in-situ transmission FT-IR. It {{was found that}} mono-coordinated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> on the ZrO 2 support reacted with CO to formate. Multi-coordinated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> were needed for formate decomposition, producing H 2 and CO 2, taking place exclusively {{in the presence of}} Pt. The observed differences in {{reactivity of}} different types of OH groups are relevant for the WGS mechanism, assuming that formate is a reactive intermediate under the conditions used in this study (300 – 400 [*]°C). The fact that Pt is needed for decomposition of formate indicates that the reactivity of formate depends on the position on the ZrO 2 surface, i. e. in close vicinity or remote from metal particles. Our results show that reduction of the support was limited to structural defective zirconia sites at edges and kinks, hosting the mono-coordinated <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups.</b> These sites can be re-oxidized with water, re-establishing the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that lipid A from Salmonella abortusequi loses its B-cell mitogenicity for murine spleen cells {{as a result}} of the introduction of succinyl residues on <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> and that the inactivated lipid A specifically antagonizes the mitogenicity of endotoxin. Hypothesizing that the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> are essential both for its biological activity and for producing nontoxic preparations having antagonistic activity, I tested the role of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> in its activities by using well-characterized biologically active lipid A preparations synthesized chemically (Escherichia coli and Salmonella types 506 and 516, respectively) by the introduction of either succinyl or acetyl residues at the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of each of these lipid A preparations. However, the biological activities of neither lipid A preparation were reduced at all after succinylation; in fact, succinylated 516 became much more potent than the original molecule with respect to most activities tested, i. e., lethal toxicity, Limulus gelation activity, and the induction of tumor necrosis factor release. On the other hand, when the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> were replaced with acetyl residues, the lethality and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of both lipid A preparations were decreased, whereas their Limulus gelation activity was increased. Mitogenicity was not affected much by the chemical modifications of either lipid A preparation. These findings indicate that although the residues introduced into the free <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> of lipid A modulate its activities, the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>groups</b> in lipid A need not exist in free form...|$|R
