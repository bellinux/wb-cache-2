50|$|In January 1979, the {{orthopedic}} unit {{moved into}} its new home on <b>the</b> sixth <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> McKay. Subsequently, patients from <b>the</b> third <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dee were relocated on <b>the</b> fourth <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> McKay and Rehab patients were moved down one floor to 3 Dee. These moves freed <b>the</b> fourth <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dee so that construction could begin on a centralized diagnostic and treatment center for cardiopulmonary illnesses.|$|R

5|$|All the {{buildings}} of the University in Sampaloc {{with the exception of}} the Seminary, the Printing Press and two first floors of Main Building were occupied. The war internees occupied three <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Main Building, the entire Education Building (presently UST Hospital), the Domestic Science building, and the School of Mines building.

5|$|The fold {{that connects}} <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublingua and tongue to <b>the</b> rear <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth {{is called the}} plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to <b>the</b> rear <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth marks <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submandibular salivary glands.|$|R

5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need to upgrade and {{renovate}} City Hall began anew in 1988. In 1994, proposals were made to remodel and update the structure to meet modern building codes, with an estimated cost of $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for earthquakes and fires.|$|E
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage. The faster a stage is cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction of the development by Multiplex proceeded, and floor space was leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building remained for lease and it was expected to be fully let before completion.|$|E
5|$|In Columbus, Ohio the Huntington Center {{was briefly}} evacuated, and {{occupants}} {{on the upper}} <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhodes State Office Tower and the Vern Riffe State Office Tower reported feeling strong shaking.

5|$|Many federal {{groups at}} 100 McAllister moved their offices in 1959–1960 {{to the newly}} built federal {{building}} at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, later named the Phillip Burton Federal Building. Occupancy at 100 McAllister was low, though the United States Army Corps of Engineers moved their San Francisco District offices there in the 1960s, and local draftees were still required to appear there through the late 1960s. The San Francisco Selective Service System offices were located in the lower <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building during the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{clothing}} items {{sold by the}} retailer included misses' fur trimmed coats, handbags, blouses, sweaters, negligees, and lingeries.

5|$|On November 23, 1957, tragedy struck {{when the}} Lathrop Building caught on fire. Firemen {{rushed to the}} scene {{to put out the}} blaze and did so quickly, but not before the {{television}} and radio studios on the top <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building were destroyed. The News-Miner offices and printing facilities on the lower floors were spared from the flames, but suffered water damage. Due to winter temperatures, the water soon froze. Despite the conditions, the paper was produced on time the next day.|$|E
5|$|Senate House Library (formerly {{known as}} the University of London Library) {{occupies}} the fourth to the eighteenth <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building with the public areas of the library on the fourth to seventh floors.

5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high {{occupancy}} rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated {{the exodus of}} many private and government firms in the 1990s, leaving entire <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office tower unoccupied. Stores on the commercial level also began closing {{due to lack of}} customers; as of 2010, many stores were being used as storerooms by Mahane Yehuda Market merchants.|$|E
5|$|From 1789 until 1792, {{when the}} French royal court {{resided in the}} Tuileries, <b>the</b> {{apartment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pavillon de Flore housed <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with}} <b>the</b> apartment <b>of</b> queen Marie Antoinette in <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tuileries, while <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pavillon housed <b>the</b> apartment <b>of</b> Madame Elisabeth.|$|R

Managed by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Cycle Center is on the fifth and sixth <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Millennium Park parking garage.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock geology of {{the parish}} {{comprises}} rocks formed in the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Cretaceous period and the Eocene age of the Palaeogene period. In places these are overlain by younger Quaternary drift material: river terrace and head deposits, clay-with-flints, and alluvium—the last found only in the valley <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger watercourses. On Puddletown Heath (now mostly covered by Puddletown Forest) are more than 370 solution hollows or sinkholes; these constitute the largest concentration of hollows on the heathlands in the area.|$|E
5|$|The bottom two <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{facility}} house offices, {{including those}} for the federal courts, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services.
