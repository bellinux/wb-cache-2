2500|$|As {{the third}} track on the album, [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] conveys the same sad and resentful outlook {{of the two}} {{preceding}} songs. Music critic Richie Unterberger views it as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song". It was the first song recorded for the album and features a two-part harmony sung by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney recalled: [...] "'Baby's in Black' we did because we liked waltz-time... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>also</b> John and I {{wanted to do something}} bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop." [...] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, {{as an example of the}} Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon knelt on the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played.|$|E
2500|$|Peter David writes Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic, {{with art}} by Rock-He Kim. The comic was {{published}} on January 28, 2014, and sees David set up key themes for Captain America: The Winter Soldier: [...] "Black Widow and Rumlow...They're okay with doing what they're told. Cap, however, is way more suspicious and wants a clearer idea of what's going on, and is annoyed that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't big on being forthcoming." [...] On Cap's relationships with new partners Black Widow and Brock Rumlow, [...] "I think {{he sees her}} as a valued ally, but [...] tends to be suspicious of the outfit that she works for. He trusts her as someone to have his back in a fight, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>also</b> believes that if S.H.I.E.L.D. told her to put a knife in his back, she would do so without hesitation, {{and that can be}} problematic. Rumlow, meantime, is an eager partner, but Cap doesn't trust him at all. First, there's the suspicion aspect. And second, I think Cap is still gun-shy because {{the last time he had}} a partner. Bucky wound up dying—or at least so he believes—and he's not anxious for history to repeat itself." ...|$|E

"The {{conception}} of {{mind as a}} system of transparent activities is, [...] <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>also</b> untenable because of its failure {{to account for the}} [...] very possibility of dreams and hallucinations.
