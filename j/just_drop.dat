2500|$|In 1951 he {{made his}} final {{first-class}} appearance, which came for the Minor Counties cricket team against Kent. In his final first-class match, he scored 8 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings and an unbeaten 21 in their second-innings. However, he went wicket-less with the ball and Kent won by an innings. This meant he went winless in his 57 first-class appearances, a record {{for the number of}} first-class appearances without featuring in a win. Perkins continued to play for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship until 1967, having by then made 105 appearances for the county. By the time of his retirement at the age of 56, he had claimed a record 779 wickets for the county, some way ahead of Colin Rutterford's 431. Such was Perkins' accuracy as a bowler, The Daily Telegraph reporter Simon Parry-Crooke described watching him bowl as: [...] "he had this incredible control: he could <b>just</b> <b>drop</b> the ball on a handkerchief." [...] Indeed, he once took 10 wickets in an innings, when playing against Hertfordshire in 1960. He still had the match ball when he celebrated his 100th birthday. Perkins also made a solitary List A appearance for Suffolk at the age of 55 in the 1966 Gillette Cup against a powerful Kent side at Ipswich School. He bowled 12 wicket-less overs for the cost of 31 runs, while he wasn't required to bat in the Suffolk innings as Kent ran out winners by 113 runs.|$|E
