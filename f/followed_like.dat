25|$|Christian {{embassies}} {{were sent}} {{as far as}} Karakorum during the Mongol invasions of the Levant, from which they gained {{a greater understanding of}} the world. The first of these travellers was Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, dispatched by Pope Innocent IV to the Great Khan, who journeyed to Mongolia and back from 1241 to 1247. About the same time, Russian prince Yaroslav of Vladimir, and subsequently his sons Alexander Nevsky and Andrey II of Vladimir, travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers <b>followed,</b> <b>like</b> French André de Longjumeau and Flemish William of Rubruck, who reached China through Central Asia. Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the Yuan Dynasty court of Kublai Khan in Travels, and it was read throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s and 1980s were a less {{influential}} {{time for}} Welsh popular music, with many Welsh acts, such as Bonnie Tyler and Shakin' Stevens, being commercially successful but through mimicking American music styles such as Motown or Rock and Roll. The Welsh language scene saw {{a dip in}} commercial popularity, but a rise in experimentation with acts such as punk band Trwynau Coch leading into a 'New Wave' of music. Bands that <b>followed,</b> <b>like</b> Anhrefn and Datblygu, found support from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, {{one of the few}} DJs outside Wales to champion Welsh language music. In the 1990s, the Welsh pop scene flourished, with the emergence of Manic Street Preachers and the Stereophonics, who although not singing in Welsh, brought a sense of Welshness through iconography, lyrics and interviews. The same period saw Catatonia, Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, bilingual bands that were successful enough to bring the Welsh language to an English speaking audience.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket has {{an equally}} strong {{influence}} on the culture of many nations, mainly Commonwealth nations, including England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe, the English-speaking Caribbean {{and especially in the}} Indian-subcontinent where it is often said to be <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> a religion. Canada has seen a marked increase in domestic, as well as interest in international cricket, over the past decade. This can be attributed, in large part, to the growing subcontinental diaspora in Canada. Cricket is the most popular sport or a major sport in most former British Colonies. Like baseball, cricket has had an {{influence on the}} lexicon of these nations with such phrases as [...] "that's not cricket" [...] (unfair), [...] "had a good innings", [...] "sticky wicket", [...] "hitting for six", [...] "played with a straight bat" [...] and [...] "bowled over".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Piper ventured to the Mid-Atlantic {{territory}} where he beat Jack Brisco for the Mid-Atlantic title. He also defeated Ric Flair for the US belt which {{turned into a}} feud. From 1981–82, Piper served as a commentator on Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and feuded {{with the likes of}} Bob Armstrong, Dick Slater, and Tommy Rich. During the summer of 1982, Piper became a fan favorite after knocking out Don Muraco and Ole Anderson to save broadcast partner Gordon Solie from Muraco, who had grown angry at Solie questioning his tactics. In Wrestling to Rasslin, Gerald W. Morton and George M. O'Brien described the transformation: [...] "the drama finally played itself out on television when one of his [...] hired assassins, Don Muraco, suddenly attacked the commentator Gordon Solie. Seeing Solie hurt, Piper unleashed his Scottish fury on Muraco. In the week that <b>followed,</b> <b>like</b> Achilles avenging Patroklas, he slaughtered villain after villain.... In the arenas fans chanted his name throughout his matches." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{thriving}} underground {{scene was}} marked {{by the start of}} Tilos Rádió in 1991, the first free independent community station, starting out as a pirate radio. The station soon developed strong ties with the first alternative electronic formations, and inspired to start many others. Bands like Korai Öröm and Másfél (also check Myster Mobius) started, playing ambient, psychedelic music. Anima Sound System, {{one of the most influential}} bands on the scene, was created in 1993 playing dub and trip-hop influenced by acid jazz and ethnic music. [...] Several other bands and formations <b>followed,</b> <b>like</b> Colorstar and Neo. Neo has won a worldwide reputation for their unique electro-pop style and the [...] "Mozart of pop music" [...] award (Cannes, 2004) they received for their soundtrack album called [...] "Control". Apart from Anima, ethnic and folk influenced the scene in many ways, exemplified by formations like Balkan Fanatik, or Mitsoura. One of the most successful Hungarian electronic musician is Yonderboi, who recently co-created Žagar, gaining wide reputation in the country. In the past few years, dubstep has gained popular attention as well, nationwide.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Not unless 'tis well <b>followed,</b> <b>like</b> {{any other}} line you take up,' said Manston. 'Besides, there's {{a way of}} liking a drop of liquor, and of being good--even religious--at the same time.' ...|$|E

25|$|Then {{the railway}} {{appeared}} in the prefecture, then linking to Sévérac-le-Château (3 May 1884).

In 1887 the old episcopal palace disappeared in flames, the prefecture had to be rebuilt.|$|R
60|$|He took Lancelot by the hand. A {{peaceful}} warmth diffused {{itself over}} his limbs; the droning of the organ sounded fainter and more faint; the marble monuments grew dim and distant; and, half unconsciously, he <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> a child through the cathedral door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't do {{to call on}} {{our friend}} for some time, so let's {{go back to the}} thicket and make ready," [...] Jet said, as he arose to his feet, and Jim <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> one who feels {{positive}} he is going to his doom.|$|E
6000|$|... "A White Orpington hen?" [...] I repeated, {{with intense}} interest. The fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity, and I <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> a child after the Pied Piper.

6000|$|... "Why, cert! That's the trick. Offer a big {{discount}}. Say full calf, two fifty; morocco, two ninety. Regular {{discount to}} the clergy, ye know.

"I {{am aware}} that a young <b>follow,</b> <b>like</b> the present Sir Wycherly, can be no {{substitute}} for an old fellow like the last Sir Wycherly, my dear; but as one is a sailor, {{and the other was}} only a landsman, my professional prejudices may not consider the disparity as great as it may possibly appear to be to your less partial judgment." ...|$|R

60|$|Andrew Black {{leaped out}} at once. Wallace <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> a harlequin. Quentin Dick {{felt that there}} was no time for him to follow without being seen.

6000|$|... "Then {{hold your}} tongue. Drive on, Tom, and here's a red rag to flap {{at the old}} thing.

2500|$|GameSpy's Elisa Di Fiore {{rated the}} PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii {{versions}} 1.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "one {{of the worst}} licensed games {{of the last few}} years." [...] She too was critical of the narrative, arguing that unless one was familiar with the source material, it was impossible to <b>follow.</b> <b>Like</b> many other reviewers, she was also critical of the controls and the camera.|$|R
50|$|At first, Buick <b>followed</b> the <b>likes</b> of Napier in {{automobile}} racing, {{winning the}} first-ever race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.|$|R
60|$|They drove homeward. The low sun {{dropped a}} spendthrift flood of gold upon the {{fortunate}} fields of wheat. The cities were far away.

60|$|Kim <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> a shadow. What he had overheard excited him wildly. This man {{was entirely}} new {{to all his}} experience, and he meant to {{investigate}} further, precisely {{as he would have}} investigated a new building or a strange festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove, and he purposed to take possession. Kim's mother had been Irish, too.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I had {{to preach}} extempore {{for the most}} part: I did {{not at all like}} it, but what could I do? Sermons and speeches <b>followed</b> <b>like</b> hail--at least one, {{sometimes}} two on week-days, and three on Sundays. I preached on such points as I had often talked out with the Primate and Sir William, and illustrated principles by an occasional statement of facts drawn from missionary experience.|$|E
50|$|The last {{full-length}} Butthole Surfers {{album of}} the 1980s marked a midway point in the band's career, straddling their psychedelic noise roots and the more accessible recordings that would <b>follow.</b> <b>Like</b> Butthole Surfers' previous releases, Hairway to Steven uses non-traditional instrumentation, extensive tape editing, and sound modulation. Unlike its predecessors, which relied almost exclusively on a foundation of electric guitar, bass, and dual drummers, it makes equally heavy use of the acoustic guitar.|$|R
