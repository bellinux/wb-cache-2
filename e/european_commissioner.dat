40|$|Discussions of {{the role}} <b>European</b> <b>Commissioners</b> play in <b>European</b> Union {{politics}} are shaped by three powerful implicit assumptions. These posit a causal relationship between a Commissioner's behaviour and previous career, portfolio and national origin. In addition, Commissioners are seen as exacerbating the fragmentation of the European Commission as a whole. Based on an empirical study of eight Commissioners from the Delors II and the Santer colleges, this article challenges or reformulates these assumptions. In so doing, it also shows that sociologies of actors such as <b>European</b> <b>Commissioners</b> 'matter' {{to the study of}} politics in the European Union.

European Union (EU) enlargement {{has been}} somewhat neglected theoretically in studies of European integration despite its importance both for member states, applicant states and the EU itself. The main purpose of this dissertation {{is to make a}} theoretical contribution to the literature through applying an institutionalist analysis to the attitudes of <b>European</b> <b>Commissioners</b> and member states as expressed through their speeches. The major research question of this dissertation is: „Which theory of institutionalism, rationalist or constructivist/sociological, better explains the attitudes of <b>European</b> <b>Commissioners</b> and member states towards deepening relations with Poland and Turkey?‟ In order to answer this question, the different stages of the EU‟s Eastern enlargement are analyzed through the case studies of Turkey and Poland. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the logic of consequentialism rather than logic of appropriateness has prevailed {{in the formation of the}} attitudes of both <b>European</b> <b>Commissioners</b> and member states towards Poland and Turkey.

25|$|Despite Labour {{success in}} the June 2001 general election, a third Cabinet {{appointment}} did not materialise and he indicated his interest in becoming the United Kingdom's <b>European</b> <b>Commissioner</b> when the new Commission was established in 2004.

Appointment as a <b>European</b> <b>Commissioner</b> would require his resignation from Parliament precipitating a by-election in his Hartlepool constituency.
