5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was <b>flashed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E

The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E

40|$|The {{amplitude}} {{of the early}} receptor potential (ERP) produced by a given <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human eye provides {{a measure of the}} amount of visual pigments present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye.

This suggests a proportional reduction of the amount of visual pigments still present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye after the bleaching <b>flash,</b> which is <b>in</b> agreement with fundus reflectometry results of Weale for the human retina.
