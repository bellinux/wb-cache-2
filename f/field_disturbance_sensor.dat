30|$|There are {{two major}} {{constituents}} to magnetic <b>disturbance</b> <b>fields</b> at polar latitudes: (1) electrical currents in the ionospheric E-layer (at an altitude of about 110  km) form the polar electrojets (PEJs) and (2) currents flowing along field lines of the ambient magnetic field feeding the PEJs by connecting the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. These so-called field-aligned currents (FACs) result in large magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> at satellite altitude, in particular in the east-west magnetic field component.|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{external}} magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{to a point}} remote from an observatory can be made, for example, by using the latitudinal-weighted arithmetic mean of the field measured at two other observatories, one {{to the north and}} one to the south of the point of interest. An alternative technique for interpolating external magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> across large spatial areas can be achieved with the Spherical Elementary Current System (SECS) method using data from a number of ground-based magnetic observatories. The SECS method represents the complex electrical current in the ionosphere as a simple set of equivalent currents placed at a specific altitude. The magnetic field recorded at observatories can be used to invert for the electrical currents and subsequently used to interpolate or extrapolate the magnetic field across a large area. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of low-frequency magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> on SQUID based low field (LF) {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) measurements is investigated. Two types of sinusoidal fields, a homogenous field and a linear gradient field, were applied as artificial disturbance sources. The influences on the free induction decay (FID) signals {{as well as on}} the spectra are discussed. The homogeneous <b>disturbance</b> <b>field</b> caused a frequency modulation of the FID signal. The measured spectra were found to be in good agreement with calculated traces obtained from a solution to the Bloch equation. The gradient <b>disturbance</b> <b>field</b> yielded an amplitude-modulated FID signal. In both cases, frequency mixing lines were observed.

40|$|Estimation of the {{external}} (to the Earth’s surface) electric or magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> at a point remote from an observatory can be difficult. We show how interpolation of electric <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the ionosphere can be achieved with the Spherical Elementary Current System (SECS) method using data {{from a number of}} ground-based magnetic observatories. The SECS method represents the complex electrical currents in the ionosphere as a simple set of equivalent currents placed at a specific altitude. The resultant magnetic field recorded at observatories can be used to invert for the electrical currents use this to interpolate the magnetic field. Here we apply the SECS method to auroral zone latitudes using a series of observatories to test how well {{the external}} field can be interpolated over large distances. We demonstrate that relatively few observatories are required to produce an estimate which is better than the null hypothesis (i. e. assuming no change) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} is investigated that a nonlocal formulation of gauge theories may provide an alternative {{mechanism for the}} generation of mass. For this purpose, a path-integral approach is used, with gauge-averaging term leading to an invertible integro-differential operator on <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> and to a mass term in the semiclassical Lagrangian. It is therefore shown that suitable choices of integral kernels {{make it possible to}} generate the mass of vector mesons from first principles (i. e. the need to obtain an invertible operator on <b>field</b> <b>disturbances),</b> without having to assume the existence of fundamental scalar fields which have not yet been observed. Although mass terms are not a generic property of nonlocal field theory, they can be therefore associated to an unavoidable step, i. e. the need to build invertible operators in perturbation theory. The paper proves also explicitly that the Faddeev–Popov procedure, when applied to a nonlocal gauge-averaging term, leads again to a BRSTinvariant theory. Typeset using REVTE...|$|R

A comparison of theoretical results with corresponding observations leads to a claim of general agreement, especially for stations at high and middle magnetic latitudes. Model results suggest that the ground magnetic field perturbations arise from complicated combinations of different kinds of currents, and that magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbances</b> due to different but related currents cancel each other out despite the inapplicability of Fukushima's (1973) theorem. It is also found that the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the horizontal magnetic <b>field</b> <b>disturbance</b> component at low latitudes is due to a net downward Birkeland current at noon, a net upward current at midnight, and, generally, antisunward-flowing electrojets...|$|R
