5|$|Leccinum holopus {{produces}} a brown spore print. Spores are somewhat fusoid (spindle-shaped) and measure 14–20 by 5–6.5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 28.5–36.5 by 11.5–12.5µm. Cystidia on the pores are flask-shaped (lageniform) to <b>fusiform,</b> and 39.0–45.5 by 7.5–9.0µm, while {{those of the}} stipe (caulocystidia) are <b>fusiform,</b> club-shaped, or cylindrical, measuring 39.0–54.5 x 9.1–13.5µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of L.holopus. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form of}} a cutis—with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, <b>fusiform</b> (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly <b>fusiform</b> or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed {{with a light}} microscope. They are <b>fusiform</b> (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, {{narrowly}} <b>fusiform</b> (fuse-shaped), {{and measure}} 7–12 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8µm and are hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. Cystidia are <b>fusiform,</b> sometimes with a rounded tip, and have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12µm. Some {{are more or}} less hyaline, while others are encrusted with a golden pigment. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually <b>fusiform,</b> hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The <b>fusiform</b> bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–16 by 8–9.5µm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15µm and usually four-spored, but sometimes two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50µm with variable morphology: club-shaped, <b>fusiform,</b> ovoid, and sometimes {{with a small}} apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25µm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. The smooth oval spores measure 12–15 by 5–6μm, and {{sometimes}} have an internal oil drop. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9μm. The <b>fusiform</b> (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm. Cap cuticle tissue {{is in the}} form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These cylindrical, interwoven hyphae contain septa.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or <b>fusiform</b> swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a <b>fusiform</b> body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a <b>fusiform</b> appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
25|$|Fruit <b>fusiform,</b> terete, glabrous, 3–8cm long; the septum {{perpendicular}} to a false septum, the combined structure cruciform in cross section.|$|E
25|$|Oikobesalon is an unbranched, {{elongate}} burrow with single-entrance and {{circular cross-section}} produced by terebellid polychaetes. They {{are covered with}} thin lining which has a transverse ornamentation {{in the form of}} <b>fusiform</b> annulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fusiform</b> dolichoectatic aneurysms {{represent}} a widening of {{a segment of}} an artery around the entire blood vessel, rather than just arising from a side of an artery's wall. They can rupture but usually do not.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} of the Opisthoproctidae varies {{between three}} main forms: the stout, deep-bodied barreleyes {{of the genera}} Opisthoproctus and Macropinna, the extremely slender and elongated spookfishes of the genera Dolichopteryx and Bathylychnops, and the intermediate <b>fusiform</b> spookfishes of the genera Rhynchohyalus and Winteria.|$|E
25|$|Aneurysms {{can also}} be {{classified}} by their macroscopic shape and size, and are described as either saccular or <b>fusiform.</b> The shape of an aneurysm is not specific for a specific disease. The size of the base or neck is useful in determining the chance of for example endovascular coiling.|$|E
25|$|Friends and foes are {{represented}} {{differently in the}} brain. The <b>fusiform</b> cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and areas involved in motivational control were differentially activated {{as a function of}} previous social encounters. In general, these areas were more active when faces were perceived as foes rather than friends.|$|E
25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural gear ratio of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural gear ratio of spindle like muscles (e.g. <b>fusiform).</b> A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural gear ratio if the muscle fibers must be squeezed into the same space.|$|E
25|$|Oospira miranda Loosjes & Loosjes-van Bemmel, 1973, is the conchologically most similar species. However, {{the shell}} of Oospira miranda is light corneous, more or less smooth, i.e. with only some faint, {{irregular}} striae. Its topwhorls increase more rapidly in width, which gives the shell a more <b>fusiform</b> shape, and the lamella subcolumellaris is not visible in a frontal view.|$|E
25|$|The basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are effused, thin, and whitish. Microscopically {{they have}} {{colourless}} hyphae, 3 to 9μm wide, without clamp connections. The basidia are ellipsoid to broadly club-shaped, 9 to 14 by 8 to 12μm, bearing four sterigmata. The basidiospores are ellipsoid and broadly <b>fusiform</b> (spindle-shaped), measuring 6 to 11 by 4 to 6μm. Pale brown sclerotia are sometimes produced, measuring 0.5 to 3mm across.|$|E
25|$|Several brain {{structures}} {{other than}} the amygdala have also been observed to be activated when individuals are presented with fearful vs. neutral faces, namely the occipitocerebellar regions including the <b>fusiform</b> gyrus and the inferior parietal / superior temporal gyri. Interestingly, fearful eyes, brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses. Scientist from Zurich {{studies show that the}} hormone oxytocin related to stress and sex reduces activity in your brain fear center.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} sinistral, not decollate, rather large, <b>fusiform,</b> solid, dark-brown, not translucent. Apical whorls are {{relatively}} broad. With 8-9 whorls, changing from apically moderately convex to somewhat flattened. Apical whorls are very finely, spirally punctated, the remaining ones with very fine, regular striae. The striae are rather faint above the aperture and not coarser on the neck. Suture is slightly indented. Neck is without a crest. Peristome is continuous, whitish, broadly reflexed and detached; basic margin {{more or less}} semicircular.|$|E
25|$|Work in {{the field}} of {{cognitive}} neuroscience has located classical language areas within the perislyvian cortex of the left hemisphere. This area is crucial for the representation of language, but other areas in the brain are shown to be active in this function as well. Language-related activation occurs in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the temporal pole, the <b>fusiform</b> gyri, the lingula, in the middle prefrontal areas (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and in the insula. There also appears to be activation in the right hemisphere during most language tasks.|$|E
25|$|In water, staying afloat is {{possible}} using buoyancy. If an animal's body is less dense than water, it can stay afloat. This requires little energy {{to maintain a}} vertical position, but requires more energy for locomotion in the horizontal plane compared to less buoyant animals. The drag encountered in water {{is much greater than}} in air. Morphology is therefore important for efficient locomotion, which is in most cases essential for basic functions such as catching prey. A <b>fusiform,</b> torpedo-like body form is seen in many aquatic animals, though the mechanisms they use for locomotion are diverse.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} dextral, decollate, rather large, {{more or less}} <b>fusiform,</b> solid, dark brown, not translucent. Apical whorls are not known. The decollated shell {{consists}} of five somewhat flattened whorls, separated by a slightly indented suture and increasing gradually in width. It is sculptured with distinct, regularly arranged ribs (5-8 per mm on the whorl above the aperture), somewhat fading above the aperture and hardly coarser in the cervical region. Neck is without a crest. Aperture is detached, obliquely pear-shaped, whitish inside. Peristome is continuous, whitish, thickened and broadly reflexed; basal side more or less semicircular.|$|E
25|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical, 8–12µm in diameter, thin-walled, and nonamyloid (that is, not {{absorbing}} iodine stain in Melzer's reagent). The pileipellis (cap cuticle) {{is composed of}} filamentous interwoven hyphae, 2–7µm diameter, gelatinized. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 36–52 by 4–13µm, 4–sterigmate, without clamps. The volva is largely made of filamentous hyphae, 2–8µm diameter, inflated cells broadly elliptic, elliptical, <b>fusiform,</b> to clavate, 40–85 by 10–35µm, mostly terminal. The stem tissue {{is made up of}} filamentous hyphae with diameters of 2–6µm; the inflated cells are terminal, club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, with dimensions of up to 289 by 31µm.|$|E
25|$|The Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery Free flap is {{technically}} {{more difficult than}} the TRAM flap, and shaping the new breast seems more challenging than with the TRAM or gluteal flap because of its <b>fusiform</b> shape. Asymmetrical donor site after unilateral breast reconstruction. The blood supply to the flap is less robust and sometimes the deep circumflex iliac vein is small, making venous anastomosis required to transfer the flap more difficult. Part of the donor site scar may be visible in swimsuit. Improper reinsertion of donor site muscles on the iliac crest can cause postoperative complications, like a hernia. Also, nerve paresthesias are possible.|$|E
25|$|Young larvae {{are dark}} {{yellowish}} green with a pale yellow {{band in the}} middle of the abdomen. From the head, which is moderately large, the body increases in thickness rapidly to the 4th or 5th segment and then tapers gradually down to the tail. It has four pairs of spines. The colour is at first smoky black, but at the last moult becomes a light clear green faintly marked with lines of a darker shade. The fully grown larva is green, <b>fusiform</b> and having small black spots. It has a pair of osmeterium and black spines on each thoracic segment, the third pair being orange yellow. A fourth pair is situated on the last segment. The caterpillars undergo five instars over a period of 15–16 days, during which many are attacked by parasitoid wasps.|$|E
25|$|Contextual effects {{occur as}} a result of the degree of {{similarity}} between the encoding context and the retrieval context of an emotional dimension. The main findings are that the current mood we are in affects what is attended, encoded and ultimately retrieved, as reflected in two similar but subtly different effects: the mood congruence effect and mood-state dependent retrieval. Positive encoding contexts have been connected to activity in the right <b>fusiform</b> gyrus. Negative encoding contexts have been correlated to activity in the right amygdala (Lewis & Critchley, 2003). However, Lewis and Critchley (2003) claim that it is not clear whether involvement of the emotional system in encoding memory differs for positive or negative emotions, or whether moods at recall lead to activity in the corresponding positive or negative neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Gravity is {{the primary}} {{obstacle}} to flight. Because {{it is impossible for}} any organism to have a density as low as that of air, flying animals must generate enough lift to ascend and remain airborne. One way to achieve this is with wings, which when moved through the air generate an upward lift force on the animal's body. Flying animals must be very light to achieve flight, the largest living flying animals being birds of around 20 kilograms. Other structural adaptations of flying animals include reduced and redistributed body weight, <b>fusiform</b> shape and powerful flight muscles; there may also be physiological adaptations. Active flight has independently evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Insects were the first taxon to evolve flight, approximately 400 million years ago (mya), followed by pterosaurs approximately 220 mya, birds approximately 160 mya, then bats about 60 mya.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{evidence}} of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age {{less than six}} months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression. Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, <b>fusiform</b> rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms. This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery stenting, bypass grafting, and even cardiac transplantation.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the <b>fusiform</b> and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. The overall pattern of results across studies indicates that people diagnosed with psychopathy demonstrate reduced MRI, fMRI, aMRI, PET, and SPECT activity {{in areas of the}} brain. Some recent fMRI studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives). Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. Meta-analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults and children/adolescents.|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume <b>fusiform,</b> lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E
25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the exact {{function}} of these areas in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The areas activated during TOT may vary depending {{on the nature of the}} target word. For example, if the target word is a person's name, the <b>fusiform</b> face area will likely show activation as the rememberer processes the person's face. Problems like this make it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure. The anterior cingulate cortex is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state. The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.|$|E
500|$|B. aemula {{closely resembles}} Banksia serrata, but the latter can be {{distinguished}} by a greyer, not orange-brown, trunk, and adult leaves wider than [...] in diameter. Inflorescences of serrata are generally a duller grey-yellow in colour, and have longer (23mm), more <b>fusiform</b> (spindle-shaped) or cylindrical pollen presenters tipping unopened flowers. Finally, the follicles are smaller.|$|E
500|$|The spores are {{cylindrical}} in shape, smooth, thin-walled, and hyaline (translucent), with {{dimensions of}} 4–6 by 2–2.5µm. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that {{one end of}} the spores has a hilar scar—an indentation in the spore wall that results during its separation from the sterigma of the basidium. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually eight-spored, and the gleba composed of chains of roughly spherical, <b>fusiform,</b> [...] to broadly club-shaped cells that are either 6.5–7.4 by 2.8–5.6µm or 37.1–46.3 by 18–28µm and also mixed with [...] cells 2.3–4.5µm wide. The hyphae of L.mokusin have clamp connections.|$|E
