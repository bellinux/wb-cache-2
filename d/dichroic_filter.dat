50|$|The {{telescope}} of the High-Resolution Camera {{was shared}} by the LIDAR instrument. The 1064 nm laser return was split to the LIDAR receiver (an avalanche photodiode detector) using a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ocean Optics has {{indicated}} that their patented <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> CFA process (alternating thin films of ZnS and Cryolite) {{can be applied to}} spectroscopic CCDs. Gersteltec sells photoresists that possesses color filter properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{are also}} used to create gobos for {{high-power}} lighting products. Pictures are made by overlapping up to four colored <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Belliveau began {{experimenting with}} <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> and {{designed}} a color fading lighting instrument called Color Pro. It used three MR-16 lamps to crossfade between colors, which was unique at the time. In the process, {{it was discovered}} that <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters,</b> which are color-tuned thin-film filters deposited on hardened glass, were very expensive. So Belliveau bought a used vacuum chamber and directed employees to re-build it for the purpose of manufacturing their own <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters.</b> At the time, there were no other lighting companies that made their own <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters.</b> Color Pro was a commercial and critical success, selling multiple hundreds of units each month. It was distributed worldwide through a newly established distributor network.|$|R
5000|$|Alternately, <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> (also called [...] "reflective" [...] or [...] "thin film" [...] or [...] "interference" [...] filters) {{can be made}} by coating a glass {{substrate}} with a series of optical coatings. <b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> usually reflect the unwanted portion of the light and transmit the remainder.|$|R
50|$|Laser {{ablation}} is {{also used}} to create pattern, removing selectively coating from <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter.</b> This products are used in stage lighting for high dimensional projections, or for calibration of machine vision's instruments.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of fluorospheres {{is that the}} excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength are not the same, so <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be used to}} give a cleaner signal. The dis{{advantage of}} the fluorospheres is photobleaching.|$|E
50|$|Indium phosphide-based {{cells have}} the {{potential}} to work in tandem with gallium arsenide cells. The two cells can be optically connected in series (with the InP cell below the GaAs cell), or in parallel through the use of spectra splitting using a <b>Dichroic</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{interference}} filter or <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> is an optical filter that reflects {{one or more}} spectral bands or lines and transmits others, while maintaining a nearly zero coefficient of absorption for all wavelengths of interest. An {{interference filter}} may be high-pass, low-pass, bandpass, or band-rejection.|$|E
50|$|The VL1 (Series 100) used <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter,</b> mounted onto three wheels {{with seven}} filters each, plus an open position. A fourth wheel was fitted with five beam {{apertures}} and two gobos. Pan and Tilt used servo motors, and intensity {{was controlled by}} an iris {{at the front of}} the head.|$|E
50|$|Artistic glass jewelry is {{occasionally}} fabricated {{to behave}} as a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter.</b> Because the wavelength of light selected by the filter varies with the angle of incidence of the light, such jewelry often has an iridescent effect, changing color as the (for example) earrings swing. Another interesting application of dichroic filters is spatial filtering.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{are made}} by {{depositing}} a series of etalonic layers on an optical surface by vapor deposition. These optical filters usually have more exact reflective and pass bands than absorptive filters. When properly designed, they run cooler than absorptive filters because they can reflect unwanted wavelengths. <b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> are widely used in optical equipment such as light sources, cameras, astronomical equipment, and laser systems.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{dichroic}} prisms use <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters,</b> {{the exact}} bandpass of each filter {{depends on the}} light incidence angle.|$|R
50|$|Filters mostly {{belong to}} one of two categories. The simplest, physically, is the {{absorptive}} filter; then there are interference or <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter,</b> {{thin-film}} filter, or {{interference filter}} {{is a very}} accurate color filter used to selectively pass light of a small range of colors while reflecting other colors. By comparison, dichroic mirrors and dichroic reflectors tend to be characterized by the color(s) of light that they reflect, rather than the color(s) they pass. (See dichroism for the etymology of the term.) ...|$|E
50|$|After the 6th {{generation}} of VL1's were completed, {{in the late}} summer of 1984, design started on the Series 200 system. A new console, called the Artisan, was designed, as well as two new luminaires: the VL2—a direct descendant of the VL1 and the VL3—a wash luminaire using a twisting <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> system to create colours, based on that first used in the VL-Zero.|$|E
50|$|A {{cold mirror}} is a {{specialized}} dielectric mirror, a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter,</b> {{that reflects the}} entire visible light spectrum while very efficiently transmitting infrared wavelengths. Similar to hot mirrors, cold mirrors can be designed for an incidence angle ranging between zero and 45 degrees, and are constructed with multi-layer dielectric coatings, {{in a manner similar}} to interference filters. Cold mirrors can be employed as dichroic beamsplitters with laser systems to reflect visible light wavelengths while transmitting infrared.|$|E
50|$|Long-pass <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{applied to}} {{ordinary}} lighting can {{prevent it from}} attracting insects. In some cases, such filters can prevent attraction of other wildlife, reducing adverse environmental impact.|$|R
50|$|Some LCD {{projectors}} use <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{instead of}} prisms {{to split the}} white light from the lamp into the three colours before passing it through the three LCD units.|$|R
50|$|Taken in isolation, H-alpha <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{are useful}} in {{astrophotography}} and for reducing the effects of light pollution. They do not have narrow enough bandwidth for observing the sun's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The VL2B saw {{the light}} source {{upgraded}} to a HTI-400SE, short arc discharge lamp, driven by the upgraded APS400 PSU. A very pale blue <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> was replaced with 3200°K tungsten correction and the beam iris motor replaced with one of a higher resolution. VL2B luminaires can be distinguished {{by the absence of}} ventilation louvres on the rear panel of the head; which were replaced by a hinged panel, through which to access the new lamp base for bulb changes and line-up.|$|E
50|$|Creating Colors from White Light:A {{projector}} using 3LCD technology {{works by}} first splitting the white {{light from the}} lamp into its three primary colors of red, green and blue by passing the lamp light through special <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> / reflector assemblies called “dichroic mirrors.” Each dichroic mirror only allows specific colored wavelengths of light to pass through while reflecting the rest away. In this way, the white light is split into its three primary color beams and each is directed toward, and subsequently through its own LCD panel.|$|E
5000|$|For {{observing the}} sun, a much {{narrower}} band filter {{can be made}} from three parts: an [...] "energy rejection filter" [...] which is usually a piece of red glass that absorbs most of the unwanted wavelengths, a Fabry-Pérot etalon which transmits several wavelengths including one centred on the H-alpha emission line, and a [...] "blocking filter" [...] -a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> which transmits the H-alpha line while stopping those other wavelengths that passed through the etalon. This combination will pass only a narrow (<0.1 nm) range of wavelengths of light centred on the H-alpha emission line.|$|E
5000|$|The unusual [...] "cyclops" [...] design carried {{just two}} wheels: one for colour {{and one for}} gobos, each with 12 {{positions}} (including 1 open). The <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> and gobos in the VL6 were interchangeable between the two wheels. With gobos set in both wheels {{and placed in the}} beam path, it is possible to [...] "morph" [...] between them, by adjusting the focus of the motorised lens (See US Patent No. 5934794). Placing <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> in both wheels, allows additional colours to be created beyond the basic palette afforded by a single wheel, although this potential has not been widely explored.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> are {{particularly}} suited for precise scientific work, since their exact colour range {{can be controlled}} by the thickness and sequence of the coatings. They are usually much more expensive and delicate than absorption filters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> can filter {{light from}} a white light source to produce light that is {{perceived}} by humans to be highly saturated (intense) in color. Although costly, such filters are popular in architectural and theatrical applications.|$|R
50|$|High-pressure bulbs are 3 to 5 {{inches long}} and {{typically}} powered by a ballast with 250 to 2,000 watts. The most common is the 400 watt variety that is used as an added face tanner in the traditional tanning bed. High-pressure lamps use quartz glass, and as such do not filter UVC. Because UVC can be deadly, a special <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter</b> glass (usually purple) is required that will filter out the UVC and UVB. The goal with high-pressure tanning bulbs is to produce a high amount of UVA only. Unfiltered light from a high-pressure lamp is rich in UVC used in germicidal lamps, for water purification, but it damages human skin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} the macular pigment {{and the distribution of}} short wavelength cones results in the fovea having a lower sensitivity to blue light (blue light scotoma). Though this is not visible under normal circumstances due to [...] "filling in" [...] of information by the brain, under certain patterns of blue light illumination, a dark spot is visible at the point of focus. Also, if mixture of red and blue light is viewed (by viewing white light through a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter),</b> the point of foveal focus will have a central red spot surrounded by a few red fringes. This is called the Maxwell's spot after James Clerk Maxwell who discovered it.|$|E
50|$|A hot {{mirror is}} a {{specialized}} dielectric mirror, a <b>dichroic</b> <b>filter,</b> often employed to protect optical systems by reflecting infrared light {{back into a}} light source, while allowing visible light to pass. Hot mirrors can be designed to be inserted into the optical system at an incidence angle varying between zero and 45 degrees, and are useful {{in a variety of}} applications where the buildup of waste heat can damage components or adversely affect spectral characteristics of the illumination source. Wavelengths reflected by an infrared hot mirror range from about 750 to 1250 nanometers. By transmitting visible light wavelengths while reflecting infrared, hot mirrors can also serve as dichromatic beam splitters for specialized applications in fluorescence microscopy or optical eye tracking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> use the {{principle}} of interference. Their layers form a sequential series of reflective cavities that resonate with the desired wavelengths. Other wavelengths destructively cancel or reflect as the peaks and troughs of the waves overlap.|$|R
50|$|In {{fluorescence}} microscopy, <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used}} as beam splitters to direct illumination of an excitation frequency toward the sample and then at an analyzer to reject that same excitation frequency but pass a particular emission frequency.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{color head}} {{the light in}} the {{enlarger}} can be adjusted for color neutral results. Therefore there are three adjustable <b>dichroic</b> <b>filters</b> - yellow, cyan and margenta inside who allow to change the color of the light source.|$|R
