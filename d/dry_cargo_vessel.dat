50|$|The {{construction}} of the Coal complex became a landmark {{of the history of}} Vostochny Port. The project execution was supervised and managed at the ministerial level, leading Soviet specialists were in charge of the project with Japanese engineers contracted to develop engineering documentation. The project entered its active phase in 1975. The construction period for such giant complex was 36 months, but the builders who worked 24 hours a day handed it over half a year ahead of schedule. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the coal complex was held on December 28, 1978 {{in the presence of the}} regional and Moscow officials, construction workers and local residents. First <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessel</b> the M/V Konstantin Petrovsky docked at the new berth and in a few minutes loading of coal cargo into her cargo holds began.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relation between marine casualty and dry bulk cargo freight rate according to the existence of spurious accident phenomenon in the <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessel</b> accidents. According to the conventional expectation, the volume of marine accidents is a random process since it is accidently occurred and not a man-made outcome. Under this circumstance, it is expected that the volume of marine accidents should be statistically uncorrelated with the freight market rates and positively correlated with the fleet size. However, the existence statistics on dry cargo marine accidents indicate high level of negative correlation with freight markets (- 0. 95 for no. of vessels and - 0. 79 for the volume of accidents in dwt) and also high level of negative correlation with the fleet size (- 0. 81 for the volume of accidents in dwt). The asymmetric interaction between the widely accepted facts and the statistical foundations is the main concern of this paper which is named the “Fallacy of Random Marine Accidents (FRMA) ”. The possible reasons of the FRMA phenomenon are considered to be based on the man-made marine accidents because of the financial collapse or as the well known term the credit default risk...|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} after World War I the Norwegian {{merchant}} fleet recouped its losses and expanded into new sectors, primarily tankers but also <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessels.</b> The 1930s, in particular, were a growth period, {{in contrast to the}} other major shipping nations. By the end of 1938 some 7% of world tonnage was Norwegian and Norway was the fourth-largest shipping nation, behind the United Kingdom, the USA and Japan. Moreover, the expansion was based on new building, thus lowering the median age of Norwegian vessels. Most of the new vessels were powered by diesel motors; they accounted for some 62% of the fleet, while Japan had some 27%, and the UK 25%. Around 42% of the fleet was modern tankers, a total of 18% of the world tanker tonnage. Norwegian shipowners were innovative and willing to take risks in ordering new vessels during the depression.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{full-fledged}} Finite Element Analysis {{is done for}} Free vibration analysis and Dynamic Forced Response Analysis of ship hull due to the slam induced load in sea way. This topic is of concern for ships and offshore structures in terms of safety, serviceability assessment including habitability. The aim is to investigate the validation available of dynamic response prediction methods. Three-dimensional Finite Element model is developed according to the ship (135 m <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessel)</b> particulars provided by the ISSC committee II. 2 Dynamic Response. Preliminary model was developed in SESAM/GeniE and later this model is used for Hydrodynamic Analysis in SESAM/HydroD and Finite Element Analysis in ABAQUS/CAE. Mass data and Bottom pressure time traces were also provided by the committee which was used for further model development and input for slamming load respectively. Committee was also provided the estimated characteristics sea state. Added mass matrices and Total damping matrices has been calculated in HydroD which was introduced in ABAQUS for Wet mode models. Low frequency natural hull girder frequencies with associated vibration modes for Dry-mode and Wet-mode models (Lightship condition, Ballast condition, Fully Loaded condition) were determined. The validity of the frequency analysis results were verified through the further investigations involving study of Classification society and ISO rules and regulations. Implicit dynamic analysis was done for the Acceleration and Strain time traces in the specified location of the ship due to the impulse load. Calculated response data will {{be compared to the}} measured data on the actual ship while at sea. The result from free vibration analysis and forced dynamic response analysis were in agreement with the accepted knowledge. A number of approximations made in the phase of model development and calculations of hydrodynamic parameter were done assuming zero forward speed which has influence on the results. In order to realize the true potential value of this work it would be necessary to compare actual ship response data to calculated data and sorting out the possible disagreements. This work is a possible source to demonstrate the adequacy of hull structural analysis tool which can potentially leading to future design improvements. </p...|$|E
50|$|Back in London Næss had to {{establish}} contact with the seven vessels operated by the group; until the invasion they had been controlled by the office in Sandefjord, Norway. These were the whale factory ship Vestfold (built in Framnæs shipyard), the tankers Norness, Norbris, Norlys, Norvinn and finally the <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessels</b> Nordal and Nortun. The British government also wanted control of his fleet, demanding to have the vessels on bare-boat charter. This was a major blow to Næss, he felt insulted by what he viewed as unfriendly treatment {{of a friend of}} Britain. Næss insisted on running the company himself; knowing both the vessels and the crew he felt he would be the most competent person for that. The British government initially did not accept this; weeks followed where Næss virtually was a hostage, not allowed to contact his vessels or leave the country. The solution came through the banker Sam Guinness, as the companies had substantial amounts of US dollars in New York banks. This money could only be released by Næss, and the British government needed dollars. So for $1,125,000 Næss got his travel permit to the US.|$|R

The largest plants are Black Sea Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Kherson Shipyard and Kuznya na Rybalskomu in Kiev. Black Sea Shipyard was formed in 1907 {{as a result of}} combining the two shipyards. This shipyard produces ocean <b>vessels,</b> tankers and <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessels.</b> Also, by 1914 it was built the first world underwater barrage [...] "Crab" [...] and the first one in the Russian Empire turbine destroyers. From 1957 to 1961 were built whaling bases [...] "Soviet Ukraine" [...] and [...] "Soviet Russia" [...] with a displacement of more than 20000 tons. Kherson Shipyard was built from 1951 to 1953. This Shipyard produces ocean vessels, river boats, ships, etc. Kuznya na Rybalskomu Plant was founded in 1862, as an engineering enterprise, but in 1913 was turned into a shipyard. Kuznya na Rybalskomu produces river vessels, sea fishing trawlers and others.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the factors determining the reporting frequency of experience data e. g. incidents and accidents. The empirical setting is the Norwegian controlled merchant fleet. Data were collected from a survey carried out in 2006, where 1262 questionnaires were gathered from 76 vessels. The data were subjected to explorative factor analysis, method of principal component and varimax rotation. Seven factors, representing latent dimensions of safety culture, were extracted. Internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha) and scale reliability were found to be acceptable. The factor scores were used in an ordered logistic regression to examine the factors’ relationships to reporting frequency. The results show that enhanced safety related training, a trusting and open relationship among the crew, safety oriented ship management, performance of pro-active risk identification activities and feedback on reported events all are significantly related to higher reporting frequency. On the other hand, demand for efficiency and lack of attention to safety from shore personnel, are significantly related to lower reporting frequency. The results also show a significantly lower reporting frequency among those who have worked with their local manager less than 1 year. Bulk and <b>dry</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>vessels</b> also show significantly lower reporting frequency than those working on liquid bulk carriers...|$|R
