50|$|The <b>hind-gut</b> is {{at first}} {{prolonged}} backward into the body-stalk as the tube of the allantois; but, {{with the growth}} and flexure of the tail-end of the embryo, the body-stalk, with its contained allantoic tube, is carried forward to the ventral aspect of the body, and consequently a bend is formed at the junction of the <b>hind-gut</b> and allantois.|$|E

Two pairs of salivary glands and one or more pairs of pancreatic glands connect to the oesophagus and presumably secrete digestive enzymes. Beyond the oesophagus lies a midgut that combines the functions of a stomach and intestine, and lacks a cuticle, enabling it to absorb nutrients.

5000|$|While foregut {{fermentation}} {{is generally}} considered more efficient, and monogastric animals cannot digest cellulose as efficiently as ruminants, hindgut fermentation allows animals to consume small amounts of low-quality forage all day long and thus survive in conditions where ruminants {{might not be able}} to obtain nutrition adequate for their needs. Hindgut fermenters are able to extract more nutrition out of small quantities of feed. [...] The large <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters are bulk feeders: they ingest large quantities of low-nutrient food, which they process more rapidly than would be possible for a similarly sized foregut fermenter.

40|$|Ruminants are {{unevenly}} distributed {{across the}} range of body sizes observed in herbivorous mammals; among extant East African species they predominate, in numbers and species richness, in the medium body sizes (10 – 600 kg). The small and the large species are all <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters. Some medium-sized <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters, equid perissodactyls, coexist with the grazing ruminants, principally bovid artiodactyls, in grassland ecosystems. These patterns have been explained by two complementary models based on differences between the digestive physiology of ruminants and <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters. The Demment and Van Soest (1985) model accounts {{for the absence of}} ruminants among the small and large species, while the Bell/Janis/Foose model accounts both for the predominance of ruminants, and their co-existence with equids among the medium-sized species (Bell 1971; Janis 1976; Foose 1982). The latter model assumes that the rumen is competitively superior to the <b>hind-gut</b> system on medium quality forages, and that <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters persist because of their ability to eat more, and thus to extract more nutrients per day from high fibre, low quality forages. Data presented here demonstrate that compared to similarly sized grazing ruminants (bovids), <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters (equids) have higher rates of food intake which more than compensate for their lesser ability to digest plant material. As a consequence equids extract more nutrients per day than bovids not only from low quality foods, but from the whole range of forages eaten by animals of this size. Neither of the current nutritional models, nor refinements of them satisfactorily explain the preponderance of the bovids among medium-sized ungulates; alternative hypotheses are presented...|$|E

40|$|The short-chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFA) formed from colonic {{fermentation}} of indigestible carbohydrates {{have been suggested}} to exert different physiological effects. In this thesis the fermentability and SCFA produced from various indigestible carbohydrates in the <b>hind-gut</b> were investigated using balance experiments in rats. In the case of propionate, experiments were also performed to evaluate possible metabolic effects. The quantity of material fermented in the <b>hind-gut</b> correlated well with {{the total amount of}} SCFA produced in caecum. However, the caecal distribution of the individual SCFA: acetic, propionic, and butyric acid varied between the different materials tested. ß-glucans and raffinose produced high proportions of butyric acid (15 %), whereas guargum gave high proportions of propionic acid (27 %). Mixtures of indigestible carbohydrates gave higher proportions of butyric acid (19 %) than all the individual substrates tested. Fermentation of resistant starch produced intermediate caecal proportions of propionic (about 16 %) and butyric acid (9 %). To increase the amount of starch fermented in the <b>hind-gut,</b> an -glucosidase inhibitor, Acarbose, was added at two levels to a starch based diet containing a mixed source of dietary fibres. The caecal SCFA pool was almost doubled but without a change in distribution of butyric acid (18 %). However, with the Acarbose supplemented diets, the concentration of propionic acid increased in colonic contents, and in distal colon butyric acid concentration increased at the higher level of Acarbose. When probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri R 2 LC and/or Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 9843) were added to a mixed diet based on oat-meal, SCFA pools and distributions were unaffected in comparison with a diet without probiotics. Antibiotic treatment resulted in significantly lower concentrations of SCFA twelve days after ceased treatment, as well as an alteration in the SCFA pattern. The distribution of butyric acid in caecum decreased from 17 % to 4 %, whereas the amount of succinic acid increased from 0 to 25 %. The amount of succinic acid decreased along the <b>hind-gut</b> to be only 2 % in faeces, whereas that of butyric acid remained low. The effect of sodium propionate on cholesterol and glucose metabolism was investigated using obese hyperinsulinaemic rats. Inclusion of sodium propionate to a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol reduced both fasting blood glucose levels and glucose excretion in urine in comparison to rats fed a diet without propionate. In addition, total pool of cholesterol in the liver decreased. When propionate was infused rectally to the large bowel only the liver cholesterol levels were reduced. However, this effect was achieved with a significantly lower dosage...|$|E

40|$|Diets {{promoting}} fermentation in the caecum {{and colon}} are commonly being prescribed as preventatives for colonic cancer (1). Evidence from animal studies indicates that diets promoting {{high levels of}} fermentation may not be beneficial to the gastrointestinal tract or immune function. The aim of the current experiment {{was to examine the}} difference in fermentation pattern, in terms of volatile fatty acids (VFA’s) and lactic acid, in the <b>hind-gut</b> of rats when fed two different commercial diets and one diet promoting increased fermentation. Thirty six male Wistar rats were fed one of 3 pelleted complete rations (n = 12). Two rations were purchased from commercial outlets, Chow (16. 6 MJ ME/kg DM, 22. 4 % CP, Ridley Agriproducts), Wheat Based (17. 1 MJ ME/kg DM, 19. 1 % CP, Breeders Choice Seeds) and one, Rice Based, was formulated to the same specifications as the Wheat Based ration (16. 9 MJ ME/kg DM, 18. 2 % CP, M. Evans). All rations were fed for 3 hours per day for 11 days. Animals were euthanased for collection of gut contents at either 3 or 21 hours after the time of feeding. Samples of digesta from the caecum, colon and rectum of each rat were collected and analysed for pH and VFA and lactic acid concentration. Data are presented for caecal measurements combined for 3 or 21 hours after feeding. Caecal butyrate concentration (mmol/l) was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in rats fed the Rice Based ration than Chow or Wheat Based rations.

40|$|Definition of {{the disease}} Paralysis is a contagiously {{transmitted}} infection of adult bees caused by multiplication of chronic paralysis virus (CPV) primarily in the brain, nerve ganglia and in the <b>hind-gut</b> epithelium. It is the only common disease of adult bees that has striking, well-defined symptoms characterised by trembling, flightless individuals crawling on the ground beneath the colony entrance. General epidemiology Although paralysis was first described {{more than a hundred}} years ago, the cause was not identified until 1963 when Bailey et a/. (1963) isolated and characterised the virus. Some twenty years earlier, before research on the small non-occluded viruses of insects had become established, Burnside (1945) showed that bacteria-free filtrates of bees with paralysis in the USA were infective. The infectivity was destroyed by heating and it seems likely that he was working with the same virus identified as the caus...|$|E

All patients whose primary tumours did not invade lymph nodes (Dukes' A or B) had liver metastases {{that did not}} involve local hepatic nodes, regardless {{of the extent of}} the disease within the liver. This suggests that factors controlling metastasis are not identical with those which control lymphatic invasion in colorectal cancer.

40|$|Laminitis in {{the horse}} is {{associated}} with the over consumption of rapidly fermentable carbohydrate, in the form of simple sugars, fructans and/or starch. The fermentation of excessive carbohydrate in the <b>hind-gut</b> can result in the production of lactic acid and other toxins which in turn may act as "laminitis trigger factors.

We have previously shown that 16 S rRNA t-RFLP profile from bacteria extracted from equine faeces clustered weakly into two clades representing normal versus laminitis-prone ponies suggesting a difference in gut microflora between the two groups (Newbold et al., 2008).

40|$|Thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa, TRP 14, has {{previously}} been identified only in humans. Here we report the identification and expression of an amphioxus TRP 14 gene, named AmphiTRP 14, the first such data in a non-mammalian organism. AmphiTRP 14 consists of a 372 -bp open reading frame coding for a 123 -amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kDa. It shares 56 % identity with human TRP 14 and possesses a highly conserved motif CPDC. Sequence comparison suggests the evolutionary appearance of the four-exon-three-intron organization of TRP 14 genes after the split of protostome/deuterostome, which is highly conserved since then. AmphiTRP 14 has been successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The recombinant protein exhibited features characteristic of human TRP 14, including a reductase activity towards insulin. Both in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry revealed that AmphiTRP 14 was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with the most abundant expression in the hepatic caecum, ovary and <b>hind-gut.</b> This suggests that AmphiTRP 14 plays a fundamental but tissue-specific role, or alternatively reflects differences in the tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} pairs of {{suspensory}} muscles in the larva of Tipula abdominalis which originate dorso-laterally between body segments one through four and insert laterally along the mid-gut and on the mid-portion of the Malpighian tubules. Cytologically these muscles resemble body wall muscles more than gut muscles. In the living animal, the muscles probably take up slack and keep the gut and Malpighian tubules from being displaced unduly. Although the existence of suspensory muscles in some insect larvae has been recognized for some time, few descriptions of these muscles have actually been published. Lyonet (1762) {{was the first to}} describe such muscles, in the carpenter moth, Cossus cossus. He observed seven pairs of these muscles which extended from intersegmental portions of the body wall to various places on the mid-gut, <b>hind-gut,</b> Malpighian tubules, and silk glands.

40|$|Larval {{fish have}} a {{relatively}} poorly developed immune system and hence they primarily rely on non-specific immune responses produced in the skin and gut. This study aims to illustrate the fine structure of gut development in common dentex (Dentex dentex) larvae and determine the initiation of pinocytic activity, which is an important early non-specific immune response in fish intestines, during various live-food feeding stages (yeast enriched rotifer, Artemia nauplii and metanauplii) from hatching (D 0) to 25 days after hatching (D 25) by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A total of 54 larvae were sampled and examined with electron microscopy. The results show that <b>hind-gut</b> intestine enterocytes have morphological features which suggest they {{play a role in}} absorption and intracellular digestion of nutrients in fish. The presence of vigorous pinocytic activity in the Artemia feeding stage between 17 - 25 days after hatching is evidence {{for the development of a}} non-specific immune system.

40|$|Serine {{protease}} inhibitors, or serpins, are a {{group of}} widely distributed proteins with similar structures that use conformational change to inhibit proteases. Antithrombin (AT) {{is a member of}} the serine protease inhibitor superfamily and a major coagulation inhibitor in all vertebrates, but its evolutionary origin remains elusive. In this study we isolated for the first time a cDNA encoding an antithrombin homolog, BjATl, from the protochordate Branchiostoma japonicum. The deduced protein BjATl consisted of 338 amino acids sharing 36. 7 % to 41. 1 % identity to known vertebrate ATs. BjATl contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site, two potential heparin binding sites and the reactive center loop with the absolutely conserved sequence Gly-Arg-Ser; all of these are features characteristic of ATs. All three phylogenetic trees constructed using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian-Inference methods also placed BjATl together with ATs. Moreover, BjATl expressed in yeast cells was able to inhibit bovine thrombin activity by forming a SDS-stable BjATlthrombin complex. It also displays a concentration-dependent inhibition of thrombin that is accelerated by heparin. Furthermore, BjATl was predominantly expressed in the hepatic caecum and <b>hind-gut,</b> agreeing with the expression pattern of AT in mammalian species. All these data clearly demonstrate that BjATl is an ortholog of vertebrate ATs, suggesting that a primitive coagulation system emerged in the protochordate...|$|E
40|$|Skatole, a {{derivative}} of tryptophan, {{is produced in}} the <b>hind-gut</b> of pigs and is metabolised via hepatic cytochrome P 4502 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1). Excessive accumulation of skatole together with androstenone, a metabolite of testosterone, in adipose tissue in some pigs is {{a major cause of}} 'boar taint' and is associated with defective expression of CYP 2 E 1. This phenomenon is not understood because factors regulating CYP 2 E 1 expression in pig liver have not yet been characterised. Therefore effects of skatole and androstenone on CYP 2 E 1 expression were studied using isolated pig hepatocytes as a model system. Skatole induced CYP 2 E 1 protein expression to the same degree as did acetone, a known CYP 2 E 1 inducer. Induction by skatole was maximum between 20 and 28 h and a half-maximum effect was obtained at a skatole concentration of 0. 2 mM. Induction of CYP 2 E 1 by skatole was protein-synthesis dependent. Androstenone antagonised the effect of skatole on CYP 2 E 1 expression but did not affect the CYP 2 E 1 protein level when added alone. These results suggest that defective expression of CYP 2 E 1 in some pigs is due to excessive concentrations of androstenone which prevent CYP 2 E 1 induction by its substrate skatole. As a result, skatole metabolism is reduced and skatole is accumulated in adipose tissue...|$|E

Five diets were used. The first diet contained steam-flaked sorghum and a supplement based on animal protein sources and 40 g/kg soya-bean meal (diet SAP). Using this diet as a base, three other diets contained either (i) guar gum, a source of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) (diet SAP + S-NSP), (ii) Novelose™, a source of resistant starch (RS) (diet SAP + RS), and (iii) a combination of both S-NSP and RS (diet SAP + S-NSP + RS). The final diet (diet WBL) was based on wheat, barley and Australian sweet lupins. Diets (i), (ii) and (iii) were formulated such that the concentrations of soluble NSP, oligosaccharide and RS were similar to those contained in diet WBL. There was no relationship (P > 0. 05) between voluntary food intake and indices of <b>hind-gut</b> fermentation, although pigs given diets SAP + S-NSP and SAP + S-NSP + RS took longer to reach the slaughter weight of 55 kg (P 0. 05) with dressing proportion.

40|$|The morphology, {{physiology}} and pharmacology of the innervation of the toad (Bufo marinus) large intestine have been studied. The large intestine {{can be divided}} into the regions colon, rectum and cloaca, on morphological grounds, but acts as a unit in response to nerve stimulation. Of the right and left nerves, each appears to supply the entire large intestine. Autonomic innervation of the large intestine of Bufo marinus is as follows: (1) The 9 th and 10 th spinal nerves (pelvic) contain predominantly excitatory preganglionic cholinergic fibres, but some inhibitory adrenergic fibres are also present in most preparations. (2) The splanchnic nerves contain inhibitory postganglionic adrenergic fibres from the 3 rd to 5 th sympathetic ganglia, and a small number of excitatory cholinergic fibres. The pathway of adrenergic inhibitory fibres to the large intestine alongside the posterior mesenteric artery as seen in mammals is rarely present in the toad. Several nonspecific actions of autonomic drugs on the large intestine are discussed. The functional organization of the autonomic innervation of the toad large intestine is similar to that in mammals, that is the large intestine is controlled by antagonistic cholinergic and adrenergic nerves. However, the separation of these two types of nerve fibres into anatomically distinct nerves {{does not appear to be}} as complete as in mammals. It is suggested that inhibitory autonomic control of the alimentary canal in vertebrates first appears in the <b>hind-gut</b> region...|$|E

Such tightly integrated symbioses are especially common in insects feeding on nutritionally challenging diets like phloem sap or vertebrate blood, but also occur in seed-eating and omnivorous taxa. Here, we characterize an intracellular symbiosis in pollen-feeding beetles of the genus Dasytes (Coleoptera, Dasytidae). High-throughput tag-encoded 16 S amplicon pyrosequencing of adult D. plumbeus and D. virens revealed a single gamma-proteobacterial symbiont that amounts to 52. 4 - 98. 7 % of the adult beetles’ entire microbial community. Almost complete 16 S rRNA sequences phylogenetically placed the symbiont into a clade comprising Buchnera and other insect endosymbionts, but sequence similarities to these closest relatives were surprisingly low (83. 4 to 87. 4 %). Using histological examination, three-dimensional reconstructions, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we localized the symbionts in three mulberry-shaped bacteriomes that {{are associated}} with the mid- to <b>hind-gut</b> transition in adult male and female beetles. Given the specialized pollen-feeding habits of the adults that contrasts with the larvae’s carnivorous lifestyle, the symbionts may provision limiting essential amino acids or vitamins as in other intracellular symbioses, or they might produce digestive enzymes that break up the fastidious pollen walls and thereby contribute to the host’s nutrition. In either case, the presence of gamma-proteobacterial symbionts in pollen-feeding beetles indicates that intracellular mutualists are more widely distributed across insects with diverse feeding habits than previously recognized...|$|E

Disease episodes tend to occur between 10 – 14  °C with necrotic lesions often seen on the skin surrounding the dorsal fin and tail. At present no commercial vaccines are available for RTFS in the UK, leaving antibiotics as the only course of action to control disease outbreaks. The current work was performed as a pilot study to assess the efficacy of a polyvalent, whole cell vaccine containing formalin-inactivated F. psychrophilum, to induce protective immunity in rainbow trout fry. Duplicate groups of 30 trout (5  g) were immersed in 1  L of the vaccine for 30  s. Samples were taken 4  h, day 2 and 7 post-vaccination (pv) of skin mucus, tissues for histology and gene expression analysis; serum and histology samples were taken 6  weeks pv. A booster vaccination was given at 315  degree days (dd) also by immersion. Challenge was by immersion with a heterologous isolate of F. psychrophilum 630  dd post primary vaccination. The vaccine provided significant protection to the trout fry with a RPS of 84 % (p <  0. 0001). Detection of increased numbers of IgT positive cells in systemic organs, up-regulation of IgT expression in <b>hind-gut</b> and an increase in total IgT in serum was observed in vaccinated fish; however a functional role of IgT in the observed protection remains to be demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Cellulose, {{the most}} {{abundant}} source of organic carbon on the planet, has wide-ranging industrial applications with increasing emphasis on biofuel production 1. Chemical methods to modify or degrade cellulose typically require strong acids and high temperatures. As such, enzymatic methods have become prominent in the bioconversion process. While the identification of active cellulases from bacterial and fungal isolates has been somewhat effective, {{the vast majority of}} microbes in nature resist laboratory cultivation. Environmental genomic, also known as metagenomic, screening approaches have great promise in bridging the cultivation gap in the search for novel bioconversion enzymes. Metagenomic screening approaches have successfully recovered novel cellulases from environments as varied as soils 2, buffalo rumen 3 and the termite <b>hind-gut</b> 4 using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plates stained with congo red dye (based on the method of Teather and Wood 5). However, the CMC method is limited in throughput, is not quantitative and manifests a low signal to noise ratio 6. Other methods have been reported 7, 8 but each use an agar plate-based assay, which is undesirable for high-throughput screening of large insert genomic libraries. Here we present a solution-based screen for cellulase activity using a chromogenic dinitrophenol (DNP) -cellobioside substrate 9. Our library was cloned into the pCC 1 copy control fosmid to increase assay sensitivity through copy number induction 10. The method uses one-pot chemistry in 384 -well microplates with the final readout provided as an absorbance measurement. This readout is quantitative, sensitive and automated with a throughput of up to 100 X 384 -well plates per day using a liquid handler and plate reader with attached stacking system...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a number}} of attributes, the African sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus is an ideal {{aquaculture}} species. Much work has been undertaken on developing the technology for the commercial culture of the species inclusive of determining the nutritional requirements for cost effective feed formulation. However, digestible energy (DE) values for specific feed ingredients were unknown. As DE values are not interchangeable between species, this study set out to determine the DE values for conventional and unconventional feed-ingredients for the formulation of an optimal feed. The ultimate goal in feed formulation is to produce a diet that supports the maximum production at the least cost. The indirect method was found to be most suitable in obtaining DE values for the catfish. Feed samples were marked by adding 2 % chromic oxide as an inert indicator. The fish were then force-fed and faecal samples were obtained from the hindgut by stripping the fish 10 hours after feeding as this was found to be when the <b>hind-gut</b> was at its fullest and the feed maximally digested. A linear based computer programme was used to formulate experimental diets using the established DE values as an additional variable. The formulated feed was tested and compared to a commercial catfish diet and a standard reference diet (H- 440). All of the newly formulated feeds were found to be cheaper to manufacture (by between 5 and 10 %). Statistically (ANOVA), all of the experimental diets resulted in higher specific growth rates (SGR) than the standard reference diet. The commercial diet also resulted in a lower SGR than those experimental diets with similar protein levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The daily energy {{requirements}} of animals {{are determined by}} a combination of physical and physiological factors, but food availability may challenge the capacity to meet nutritional needs. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are an interesting model for investigating this topic because they are folivore-frugivores that adjust their diet and activities to seasonal variation in fruit availability. Observations of one habituated group of western gorillas in Bai-Hokou, Central African Republic (December 2004 -December 2005) were used to examine seasonal variation in diet quality and nutritional intake. We tested if during the high fruit season the food consumed by western gorillas was higher in quality (higher in energy, sugar, fat but lower in fibre and antifeedants) than during the low fruit season. Food consumed during the high fruit season was higher in digestible energy, but not any other macronutrients. Second, we investigated whether the gorillas increased their daily intake of carbohydrates, metabolizable energy (KCal/g OM), or other nutrients during the high fruit season. Intake of dry matter, fibers, fat, protein and the majority of minerals and phenols decreased with increased frugivory and there was some indication of seasonal variation in intake of energy (KCal/g OM), tannins, protein/fiber ratio, and iron. Intake of non-structural carbohydrates and sugars was not influenced by fruit availability. Gorillas are probably able to extract large quantities of energy via fermentation since they rely on proteinaceous leaves during the low fruit season. Macronutrients and micronutrients, but not digestible energy, may be limited for them during times of low fruit availability because they are <b>hind-gut</b> fermenters. We discuss the advantages of seasonal frugivores having large dietary breath and flexibility, significant characteristics to consider in the conservation strategies of endangered species...|$|E
