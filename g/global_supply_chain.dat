In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access.

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza.

He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers".

In this thesis, we propose a multi-tier supplier {{quality evaluation}} framework based on total cost of ownership and data envelopment analysis for quality management in <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The proposed approach comprises of three main steps. Firstly, we group the upstream suppliers based on common attributes using hierarchical cluster analysis. Then, we calculate the total cost of ownership for the grouped suppliers and their sub-suppliers using various qualitative and quantitative factors that are vital for quality management in <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> In the third and the last step, we apply data envelopment analysis to compute the efficiencies of various suppliers to identify the best one (s) and recommend for selection. A numerical application is provided. The proposed approach is very useful to decision makers in benchmarking supplier quality performances and setting improvement targets for supplier quality development in <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} world-economy Chinese firms have significantly improved their positions within <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> One way {{this has been}} achieved is through the disintermediation of <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> i. e. their evolution from contract manufacturing to original equipment manufacturing. The more successful firms are even retailing indigenously developed products to western end consumers. The global value chains (GVCs) paradigm of the economic sociology understands this phenomenon as improving firm- and meso- level competencies motivated by economics. Consequently, how individual agency and broader social contexts influence transnational production is not well understood. Based on interviews with 18 Chinese entrepreneurs of factory direct furniture retailers in Sydney, this study finds that individual agency within particular sociohistorical contexts are influential to the disintermediation of <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The {{results show that the}} GVCs paradigm needs refinement in order to fully understand <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> and disintermediation as sociological – rather than economic – phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> {{are built}} on organizational, information, and {{logistics}} networks. Ports are connected via these networks and also need to connect these networks. Synchromodality is an innovative concept for container transportation, and the port {{plays an important role}} in connecting the various transportation networks. The large number of <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> that use the port as a hub require added value, and this can be provided by interconnecting the three types of networks, for example via the port community system. <b>Global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> can be more sustainable when interconnected networks create visibility, together with the proper mechanisms to support value creation, not just monetary value, but also other values such as security and environmental footprint. The research required to further develop these topics make use of quantitative modeling from the field of operations management. This inaugural speech touches upon a number of these research challenges. The ambitions and plans of the chair “Ports in Global Networks” concern three interrelated research topics: (1) Synchronizing transportation networks; (2) Connecting sea ports to <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> chains; and (3) Coordinating <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> for sustainability. The educational program involves both the RSM MSc program <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Management, but also the Executive Master Customs and <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Compliance.

This omission represents a severe shortcoming because the understanding of what constitutes legitimate behavior may vary substantially between contexts. This conceptual study employs the institutional distance concept {{to the case of}} <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> sustainability risks. It focuses initially on paradoxical situations in which both the buyer and the supplier fully comply with stakeholder expectations within their own legitimacy contexts, yet the buyer's stakeholders still withdraw legitimacy from and harm the buyer. The study analyzes the causal microfoundations of how and why such paradoxical risks manifest, drawing on stakeholder theory and institutional theory. The analysis shows that accounting for the differing legitimacy contexts is necessary for explaining these risks, thereby substantiating our initial claim that institutional distance matters to <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The study yields important implications for corporate practice in that it highlights an inherent trade-off in many <b>global</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
