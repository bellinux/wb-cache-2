Each volunteered his testimony early in the investigation, and LaRoche risked making statements that the court could have construed as self-incriminating. Spady concluded that a group had in fact been about to launch the [...] "rising" [...] (as they called it) when their plans were revealed.

2500|$|Tibbits Opera House {{continued}} to host {{many of the}} same types of programming as under previous eras of management, while also bringing new variety to the stage as well. Theatre genres included melodramas, pastoral plays, Irish dramas, combination plays, farce and scenic attractions with Charles Hoyt and Clyde Fitch being the most popular playwrights. The farces tended to focus more on comic specialties rather than a <b>developed</b> <b>plot.</b> Regarding one such farce, At the French Ball, a reviewer quipped, [...] "…The play is one of those kind of creations that one enjoys when he has had a good dinner and has nothing else to do but to gaze and laugh, and feel as Frenchy as possible." [...] Another feature of comedy in this era is that it increasingly included elements of vaudeville with it becoming increasingly [...] "difficult to distinguish between pure comedy and variety entertainments." [...] Famous melodramas during the period included The Convict's Daughter and Was She to Blame. The number of Uncle Tom's Cabin companies, whose shows had apparently evolved into farce and comedy from the original serious tenor of the story, declined during this period. But taking the place of Uncle Tom's Cabin was the oft repeated Faust, an opera which stressed scenery and electrical effects. The comic opera Wang featured one of the more absurd stunts performed on the Tibbits stage with a beer-drinking elephant that downed a four-gallon glass of brew. All in all, 376 plays were performed on the Tibbits stage in the decade from 1894 to 1904 alone, a large increase from the Barton S. Tibbits era.|$|E

50|$|Deadline Dramas roots can {{be traced}} back to medieval days when a court jester would take plot {{suggestions}} offered by noblemen and improvise short plays.

White and his cast of two would retire to a soundproof control room where they had just two minutes to work out a fully <b>developed</b> <b>plot.</b> While they frantically picked at story threads, a sound man listened in via earphones, improvising his effects and devising cues for organist Rosa Rio. When the three players emerged, they delivered a polished seven-minute playlet, to the amazement of those listening at home.|$|E

40|$|The burial area is {{composed}} of nineteen sepulchral pits and is dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 4 th century AD to the early 5 th century AD. It is found in a very discreetly <b>developed</b> <b>plot,</b> suggested only by a probable boundary stone and diffuse scattered bits of furniture. The tombs were placed on a ground which was initially inclined in a northwest direction; no material trace of a path has survived, either because it was located {{at the top of the}} slope, or because it was on the opposite side and has been destroyed by the modern path and installations. Composed of thirteen adults and nine children (20 q 0 = 409 %c), the burial unit is probably that of a small rural family pattern group, used by three to four generations at the most. The study presented here mainly endeavours to highlight modes of burial and funerary practices by means of a precise analysis of the in situ skeletons and furniture.
