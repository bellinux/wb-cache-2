500|$|The {{focus of}} much of Cardus's cricket writing was the Lancashire side of the inter-war years, and in {{particular}} their twice-yearly battles with rivals Yorkshire. His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on [...] "the match within the match", with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>add</b> up the notes of a Mozart [...] "Vivace" [...] to evaluate the music?" [...] To meet Cardus's requirements, the players were sometimes [...] "enlarged", notably Emmott Robinson, the veteran Yorkshire all-rounder of the 1920s who through Cardus's pen became [...] "the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character". In the 1930s, Cardus's style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the England versus Australia Test series of 1930 Cardus described the Australian as [...] "an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us".|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might <b>I</b> <b>add</b> a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "Neither shall he multiply wives to himself" [...] in [...] to limit him {{to no more}} than 18 wives. Judah said that he could have more wives, provided that they did not turn away his heart. But Simeon said that he must not marry even one wife who would turn away his heart. The Mishnah concluded that [...] prohibited the king from marrying more than 18 wives, even if they were all as righteous as Abigail the wife of David.. The Gemara noted that Judah did not always employ the rationale behind a Biblical passage as a basis for limiting its legal effect, as he did here in [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Judah employed the rationale behind the law here because [...] itself expounds the rationale behind its legal constraint: The reason behind the command, [...] "he shall not multiply wives to himself," [...] is so [...] "that his heart be not turned aside." [...] Thus Rabbi Judah reasoned that [...] itself restricts the law to these conditions, and a king could have more wives if [...] "his heart be not turned aside." [...] The Gemara noted that Simeon did not always interpret a Biblical passage strictly by its plain meaning, as he appeared to do here in [...] The Gemara explained that Simeon could have reasoned that [...] adds the words, [...] "that his heart turn not away," [...] to imply that the king must not marry even a single wife who might turn away his heart. And one could interpret the words [...] "he shall not multiply" [...] to mean that the king must not marry many wives even if they, like Abigail, would never turn away his heart. The Gemara then analyzed how the anonymous first view in [...] came to its conclusion that the king could have no more than 18 wives. The Gemara noted that [...] refers to the children of six of David's wives born to David in Hebron. The Gemara reasoned that the prophet Nathan referred to these six wives in [...] when he said, [...] "And if that were too little, then would <b>I</b> <b>add</b> to you the like of these, and the like of these," [...] each [...] "these" [...] implying six more wives. Thus with the original six, these two additions of six would make 18 in all.|$|E
