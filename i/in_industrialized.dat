5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% <b>in</b> <b>industrialized</b> countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{episodes of}} rapid growth are {{accompanied}} by significant structural change. In this paper we therefore aim to quantify {{the extent to which}} factor accumulation induces structural change and productivity growth <b>in</b> <b>industrializing</b> economies. To fix ideas we present an extension of Barro, Mankiw and Sala-i-Martin?s (1995) growth model that incorporates two sectors, traditional and modern, and an endogenous wage gap, due to efficiency wages. The model thus draws on ideas of Lewis (1954) and the dual economy literature. We quantify the model using a panel of 78 countries over the post war era. The results show that these labour reallocation effects can increase the effective return to physical capital by around 30 % in many countries. We conclude that the productivity gains through labour re-allocation are potentially a significant contributing factor to transitional growth episodes <b>in</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries, and provide some examples...|$|R
