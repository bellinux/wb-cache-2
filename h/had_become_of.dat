A Picture and A Narrative of the Origin, Growth, Excellences, Abuses, Beauties, and Personages of Our Governing City, a {{work that}} covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then-present day. The Civil War defenses of Washington figure prominently in the later portions of the book, and he uses the state of Fort Stanton {{as an example of}} what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> the forts a decade after they had been built.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime. Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E

25|$|In January 2005, Rader {{attempted}} {{to leave a}} cereal box {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck at a Home Depot in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.|$|E

Sarbi {{reportedly}} disappeared 'in {{the heat of}} battle' and was said by a Defence spokesperson to have vanished when a rocket exploded near her during the ambush. The ambush in which Sarbi went missing was the same action in which SASR Trooper Mark Donaldson became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first VC awarded to an Australian since 1969. Sarbi was declared MIA in September 2008, and while missing, the Special Operations Task Group had made repeated attempts {{to find out what}} <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|E
500|$|After {{the successes}} of carrier combat {{achieving}} air supremacy in both 1942's Battle of the Coral Sea, and, to a greater extent, Battle of Midway, the Navy was forced to shift its building focus from battleships to aircraft carriers. [...] As a result, construction of the fleet of s had been given highest priority. [...] In the process, the United States accepted shortcomings in the armor of their s, South Dakota-class, and s in favor of additional speed. This allowed them to steam with the Essex-class while providing the carriers with maximum anti-aircraft protection; their main batteries <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> secondary importance.|$|E
500|$|Bovet {{was neither}} the first nor the last company {{to target the}} Chinese watch market. They shared it with Ilbury, Jaques Ullmann, and Vacheron Constantin, among others. Edouard Bovet {{discovered}} {{the potential of the}} Chinese market as a student of Ilbery in London, from whom he borrowed some design ideas. While from 1820 onwards Vacheron Constantin dominated the market in imperial northern China, Bovet remained market leader in the more populous south of the country. [...] Although the 19th-century Chinese watch market was predated by a few Jesuit watch makers as early as the 15th century, by the early 19th century watch making in China <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> such a low quality that the new European watches were quickly appreciated.|$|E

500|$|Keen to {{find out}} what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> the ships and men of Franklin's expedition, in 1848 the Royal Navy sent a search party led by John Richardson and John Rae, and {{equipped}} with a Halkett boat provided by the government, to search for the lost expedition. The party was unable to locate Franklin, but found the Halkett boat invaluable, on one occasion using the single boat to ferry their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae noted that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, there was no difficulty in warming it to soften the material when necessary. Halkett boats were likewise taken on the subsequent [...] expedition that was sent to search for Franklin, during which they were successfully used for fishing.|$|E
500|$|Copper prices {{began to}} rise in 1973, {{to such an extent}} that the {{intrinsic}} value of the coin approached a cent, and citizens began to hoard cents, hoping to realize a profit. [...] The Mint decided to switch to an aluminum cent. [...] Over a million and a half such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973, though they were dated 1974. [...] At congressional hearings, representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment, and the Mint backed away from its proposal. [...] Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed to members of Congress, but 14 remained missing, with the recipients affecting not to know what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> them. [...] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection; another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer. [...] Experiments were also conducted with bronze-clad steel cents. [...] Slated for disposal, when a bag of them tore open before going into a smelter a few were kept by the workers. [...] They are also considered to be illegally held government property. [...] Recognizing that a change from the current copper composition was still inevitable, Congress passed Public Law 93-441 on October 11, 1974, declaring [...] "henever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury such action is necessary to assure an adequate supply of coins to meet the national needs, he may prescribe such composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent piece as he may deem appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|While professing that Anarky was the {{character}} {{for whom he}} was proudest, and that {{the character}}'s narratives were among his best achievements {{for the amount of}} reaction they generated among readers, the character was also a source of some regret for Grant. Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new Robin, Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of Tim Drake, he occasionally experiences [...] "twinges of regret that Anarky wasn’t chosen as the new sidekick for comics' greatest hero." [...] Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics, and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about. He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or, as he felt, were mismanaged. Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky, [...] "if you create something that's close to your heart and you don't own it, 'Oh woe is me!'" [...] In 2011, DC Comics initiated a special DC Retroactive series of comics, exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters. Both Grant and Breyfogle were invited to participate, and collaborated to reproduce a story in the style of their classic Batman: Shadow of the Bat series. Grant chose to author a story featuring the Ventriloquist. However, he had been tempted to author a story featuring Anarky, only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> Anarky's canonical status at the time.|$|E

500|$|On 2 January 2000, Lancashire {{returned}} to Coronation Street {{for a single}} episode in which Raquel asks Curly for a divorce. Lancashire felt it was an apt time to return, as she was now a more confident actress and wanted to portray Raquel again before she aged significantly. The series' producer at the time, Jane Macnaught, deemed Raquel one of Coronation Street most popular ever characters and her return an opportunity for her [...] "millions of fans" [...] to learn what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> her. Lancashire and Kennedy were the sole actors in the episode, the first to feature just two characters. From late January, Lancashire appeared as factory employee Yvonne Kolakowski, a widow with a dysfunctional personal life, in the BBC One drama series Clocking Off. Lancashire used her own experiences as a single mother in her characterisation. In March, she played actress Coral Atkins in the television film Seeing Red. Lancashire found shooting the drama, which detailed Atkins' decision to quit her acting career in order {{to set up a}} care home for abused children, [...] "mentally draining". Lancashire then spent eight weeks filming the BBC One legal sitcom Chambers in which she played [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "bigoted" [...] barrister Ruth Quirke. The series was aired from June 2000. Lancashire's final role in 2000 was in the two-part drama thriller My Fragile Heart. Lancashire's output in 2000 earned her several awards. She was voted best actress at the TV Quick Awards in September 2000 for her roles in Clocking Off and Seeing Red, and in October was voted Most Popular Actress at the 6th National Television Awards for Seeing Red. In March 2001 she was named Drama Performer of the Year by the Television and Radio Industries Club, with mention of her work in Clocking Off and Seeing Red.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{backers of}} races {{on the road}} were newspapers. Although Le Vélocipède Illustré, which was behind the world's first long-distance road race in November 1869, said its purpose was [...] "to further the good cause of the bicycle" [...] because [...] "it must be {{determined}} that the bicycle can be raced over considerable distances with incomparably less fatigue than running", it can't have escaped the circulation department that the race would do the newspaper's sales {{a lot of good}} as well. In an era before radio and television, newspapers could build the drama of a race for weeks, rely on customers buying a further copy on the day to prepare for the riders to pass and then another next day to see what <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> them. Few people had travelled 130km, at least not often, and the idea of doing it by bicycle and at as high a speed as possible when the roads were potholed and bicycles had wooden wheels and metal tyres was exciting. The result was that newspapers outdid each other in promotions. In 1891, came a race from Bordeaux to Paris. In the same year, Le Petit Journal went twice as far by running Paris–Brest–Paris over 1,200km.|$|E
