25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, <b>I</b> <b>imagine,</b> for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E
25|$|With Murray’s support, in {{the autumn}} of 1916 Robertson had {{resisted}} attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to Rabegh to help the nascent Arab Revolt, stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray’s advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers (8 December 1916) of “attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> they did to the German attack on Ypres two years ago”, {{but for the first time}} ministers contemplated overruling him. Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.|$|E

In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed.

500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> people are going through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and megalomania, while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E

Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E

500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> it would have been like if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends ended. Last night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating reminder of what we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|E
500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band. [...] "The next one to leave the band will finish it," [...] Collins told Rolling Stone magazine in May 1985. [...] "I feel happier with what we're doing now, because I feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one." [...] Collins added, [...] "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won't leave the group, but <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> it will end by mutual consent." [...] In June, Collins spoke of the band's intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world <b>I</b> <b>imagine,</b> if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised {{the choice of}} having Rivers guest star since {{she was able to}} [...] "employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire." [...] He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, [...] "Krusty is such {{a large part of the}} supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may seem a little funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode [...] "wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> your assessment of the episode may be based largely on your opinion of the guest star. That said? I dug it." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1950, the {{government}} called for Second World War veterans {{to serve in}} the Korea War as part of the specially raised 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant. After training at Puckapunyal, Victoria, and in Japan, he arrived in Korea in November 1950. He served with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), initially as a platoon commander in A Company. In February 1951, he took charge of ACompany when its commander was wounded; he was subsequently given command of CCompany. Promoted to captain, Saunders led CCompany during the Battle of Kapyong in April, when 3RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital Seoul. [...] Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong, he afterwards recorded that, [...] "At last I felt like an Anzac and <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> there were 600 others like me". The 3rd Battalion was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation for its part in the action. Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down. Leading a Vickers machine gun platoon at the Battle of Maryang San in October, he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3RAR officer: as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them, Saunders' companion remarked, [...] "No country for white men", to which Saunders replied, [...] "It's no country for black men, either". He returned to Australia in November 1951.|$|E
500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E
