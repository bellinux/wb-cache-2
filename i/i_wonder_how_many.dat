60|$|Another of your fool's errands, Allan my boy, I said to myself. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{more you}} {{are destined to}} survive.|$|E
60|$|I {{will add}} {{no more to}} this lest you should want to {{communicate}} with the artist; try another sheet. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> I'll keep wandering to.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> authors it {{will take}} to enchant our country from Maine to New Orleans, as every foot of ground is enchanted here in Scotland.|$|E
60|$|Then {{and there}} he {{delivered}} a remarkably neat little oration--pat, well put together, and clearly delivered. So it came to pass that the Queen's health was best honoured by an American. We English were dazed. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> Englishmen not trained to addressing their fellows would have spoken half so fluently as the gentleman from 'Frisco.|$|R
60|$|The Bisons were prancing {{about the}} diamond, and their swaggering {{assurance}} was {{not conducive to}} hope for the Worcesters. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of that vast, noisy audience, intent on the day's sport, even had a thought of what pain and toil it meant to my players. The Buffalo men were in good shape; they had been lucky; {{they were at the}} top of their stride, and that made all the difference.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Postal Service {{operates}} the Danciger Post Office on Farm to Market Road 1301. In July 2011 the USPS {{announced that it}} may close the post office. Joe King, the Brazoria County Judge, said in 2011 {{that he was not}} surprised that the postal agency targeted the post office for closure and that [...] "for years, when I drove by, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people it served. There's nothing there — just this tiny house about the size of my office, sitting in the yard of another house. There's nothing else out there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give us the [...] "Ganges Pilot"; you sang that in {{the square}} the night before El-Maghrib. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the chorus are alive to-night,' said Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give us the 'Ganges Pilot'; you sang that in {{the square}} the night before El- Maghrib. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the chorus are alive tonight," [...] said Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, so you did. It is {{the name}} of the embalmer, I take it. A very {{conscientious}} worker he must have been. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> modern works will survive four thousand years?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, oh, no," [...] replied Peter Rabbit in disgust. [...] "I {{was talking}} to myself, just {{thinking}} out loud. <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> nuts a Jay could steal {{if he had the}} chance." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} Word Ways articles I {{have examined}} vowel trigrams and vowel tetragrams. Since so many vowel trigrams exist {{as parts of}} words and names, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> could exist as words or names in their own right. I use the term 2 ̆ 2 vowel 2 ̆ 2 to include six letters A, E, I, O, U an Y, though {{in several of the}} words presented in this article Y is clearly being used as a consonant. Could a significant proportion of the 216 all-vowel three-letter sequences be verified as genuine words or names...|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{to see that}} the human folk of this inner world had not {{advanced}} far in learning, and the thought that the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a very pathetic one indeed. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> ages it would take to lift these people out of their ignorance even were it given to Perry and me to attempt it. Possibly we would be killed for our pains as were those men of the outer world who dared challenge the dense ignorance and superstitions of the earth's younger days. But it was worth the effort if the opportunity ever presented itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a strange}} little girl you are!" [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I shouldn't be mad about {{you if you}} weren't that way. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> women I have married." ...|$|E
6000|$|Not till he {{had passed}} entirely out of hearing did Victor speak, then he burst forth. [...] "The old fraud! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> more such {{visitors}} we are to have? I wish we could take her away from this place." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many,</b> even {{of those}} who {{honestly}} and attentively join in our Church services, attach any distinct idea to the second clause of the Lord's Prayer--the first petition of it--the first thing that they are ordered by Christ to seek of their Father? ...|$|E
6000|$|This was too {{surprising}} {{to be passed}} over unnoticed. When Minnie was gone, I lay awake and pondered about it. Had all the Moores got scars on their hands, <b>I</b> <b>wondered?</b> And <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people, <b>I</b> asked myself, had cut themselves time and again in climbing over that barricaded garden-wall of my father's? ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{well the}} man reasoned. Lunatics always do {{within their own}} scope. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> at <b>how</b> <b>many</b> lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and today begun a new record. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> of us begin a new record with each day of our lives? ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, though {{undertaken}} {{under the}} spur of the moment, I protest it was indeed a brave deed, and <b>I</b> cannot but <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> young gentlemen of sixteen there are to-day who, upon a like occasion, would act as well as our Harry.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a prince}} he looks like," [...] quoth Tom to himself, {{as he waited}} in the bank outside, and looked through the glass screen. [...] "How well the old man wears! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> fresh {{thousands}} he has made since I saw him last, seven years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 230. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many,</b> even {{of those}} who {{honestly}} and attentively join in our Church services, attach any distinct idea to the second clause of the Lord's Prayer, the first petition of it, {{the first thing that}} they are ordered by Christ to seek of their Father? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will, {{long before}} it comes off. In fact, I am as great a {{stranger}} as yourself. Ah! there's an opportunity!" [...] as the bell pealed. [...] "The Bowaters, very likely; I saw their Noah's ark as I passed the Poynsett Arms, with the horses taken out. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> are coming--worthy folks!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there had}} been nothing to fear. On my way home, as the day was breaking, I smiled to myself at the matter-of-fact {{way in which a}} woman had opened the little door, and shown me into the room Claudia had told me of. She was evidently well used to her business; she did not even take the trouble to look into my face to see who was the newcomer. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> well-cloaked gallants she had let in by the same door; I did not care if they were half a hundred. I did not suppose the {{beautiful}} Claudia was more virtuous than myself. Suddenly {{it occurred to me that}} I had revenged myself on Ercole Piacentini at last; and the quaint thought, coming unexpectedly, made me stop dead and burst into a shout of laughter. The thought of that hang-dog visage, and the beautiful ornaments I had given him, was enough to make a dead man merry. Oh, it was a fairer revenge than any I could have dreamed of! ...|$|R
60|$|This was downright generous of Mr. Cooke. We have all, no doubt, drawn {{our line}} {{between what is}} right and what is wrong, but <b>I</b> have often <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of us with the world's indorsement across our backs {{trespass}} as little {{on the other side of}} the line as he.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair, and became fascinated by the dismal {{atmosphere}} of the place. I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything. But <b>I</b> sat <b>wondering</b> and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't spoil a good simile with {{superfluous}} exactness, Alda! It is base {{enough to}} compare the gardens of the Hesperides to a merchant's office! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> years {{it will take to}} get out of the drudgery, and have some power of enjoying life and relieving Felix. One could tear one's hair to see him tied down by this large family till all his best days are gone.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{men have}} any real freedom of mind, are, in truth, unhampered by such associations, to whom all that is great and noble in life does not, at times at least, if not always, seem {{secondary}} to obscure rivalries and considerations, to the petty hates that are like germs in the blood, to the lust for self-assertion, to dwarfish pride, to affections they gave in pledge even before they were men.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people, nowadays, whose {{bread and}} butter was cut too thin for them, would think of {{comparing}} the slices to poppy leaves? But {{this was in the}} old days of travelling, when people did not whirl themselves past corn-fields, that they might have more time to walk on paving-stones; and understood that {87} poppies did not mingle their scarlet among the gold, without some purpose of the poppy-Maker that they should be looked at.|$|E
5000|$|The Cultural Revolution {{started when}} Chang was a teenager. Chang willingly joined the Red Guards though she recoiled {{from some of}} their brutal actions. As Mao's {{personality}} cult grew, life became more difficult and dangerous. Chang's father became a target for the Red Guards when he mildly but openly criticised Mao due to the suffering caused to Chinese people by the Cultural Revolution. Chang's parents were labeled as capitalist roaders and made subjects of public struggle meetings and torture. Chang recalls that her father deteriorated physically and mentally, until his eventual death. Her father's treatment prompted Chang's previous doubts about Mao {{to come to the}} fore. Like thousands of other young people, Chang was sent down to the countryside for education and thought reform by the peasants, a difficult, harsh and pointless experience. At the end of the Cultural Revolution Chang returned home and worked hard to gain a place at university. Not long after she succeeded, Mao died. The whole nation was shocked in mourning, though Chang writes that: [...] "People had been acting for so long they confused it with their true feelings. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the tears were genuine". Chang said that she felt exhilarated by Mao's death.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2008, Yon {{published}} his second book, Moment of Truth in Iraq, through Richard Vigilante Books. The book describes how U.S. counterinsurgency methods are creating what Yon {{sees as a}} foundation of success in Iraq. Within two weeks of its release date, Moment of Truth entered into Amazon.com's list of Top 10 bestsellers. Yon was quoted by fellow blogger Glenn Reynolds as saying, [...] "That's just wild. Folks really did want that book after all. <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people even cared. It's great to know {{that people want to}} really know what's going on." ...|$|R
5000|$|This book {{contains}} much of Carlin's {{stand-up comedy}} material. The title derives {{from one of}} the observations in the book: Carlin finds it interesting that the same race can invent something as fun and innocent as Silly Putty and something as deadly as napalm — the two have many similar properties. The title is also an allusion to the type of thoughts that occupy his time, saying, [...] "on one hand I kinda like it when a lot of people die, but on the other hand, <b>I</b> always <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> unused frequent-flyer miles they had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His coachman or his groom has; {{or perhaps}} he keeps what they call an ekkery. He's much too big a swell to write {{to the likes of}} me. Lord bless me,--when I think of it, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> dozen of orders I've had from Lord Rufford under his own hand. 'Dear Runciman, dinner at eight; ten of us; won't wait a moment. Yours R.' I suppose Mr. Morton would think that his lordship had let himself down by {{anything}} of that sort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{leaving the}} workhouse, {{we drove to}} Norris Green; and Mrs. ------ showed me round the grounds, which are very good and nicely kept. O these English homes, what {{delightful}} places they are! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people live and die in the workhouse, having no other home, because other people {{have a great deal}} more home than enough. [...] . We had a very pleasant dinner, and Mr. M------ and I walked back, four miles and a half, to Liverpool, where we arrived just before midnight.|$|E
6000|$|Can {{anything}} be more [...] "amazing horrid," [...] {{above all}} {{as there are}} mysterious figures in and about the tower? Mrs. Radcliffe's lamps always fall, or are blown out, {{in the nick of}} time, an expedient already used by Clara Reeve in that very mild but once popular ghost story, [...] "The Old English Baron" [...] (1777). All authors have such favourite devices, and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> fights Mr. Stanley Weyman's heroes have fought, from the cellar to their favourite tilting ground, the roof of a strange house! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "the {{business}} women {{will bring about}} {{a new kind of}} marriage in which men will have to keep up respect and courtesy.... <b>I</b> wonder--I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> millions of women in what are supposed to be happy homes are sick over being chambermaids and mistresses till they get dulled and used to it. Nobody will ever know. All these books about women being emancipated--you'd think marriage had changed entirely. Yet, right now, in 1912, in Panama and this hotel--not changed a bit. The business women must simply compel men to--oh, to shave!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the gods}} of the heathen cannot hear; {{and those of the}} white men may, it seems, be propitiated by masses in the cathedral and stained windows bought with cocoa and rubber dividends. Well, one must try to believe that Domingo's laborers enlisted for the purpose of being taught {{agriculture}} by the white men of their own free will. At least, that is the comfortable assurance usually furnished the civilized powers, and as they have their own little problems to grapple with they complacently shut one eye. <b>I</b> only <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> played-out niggers' throats Domingo has cut on the way. In the meanwhile, Lamartine is dying, and we may as well get on again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As if I didn't know that!" [...] said Carey, with an angry, hurt little laugh; [...] "and so I {{waited to}} be chaperoned {{up to the}} eyes between Clara Acton and the Duck in the very house with me. Now, Mary, I put it to you. Has one word passed that could do harm? Isn't it much more {{innocent}} than all the Coffinkey gossip? I have no doubt Mrs. Coffinkey's sister-in-law looks up from her black-bordered pocket- handkerchief to hear how Mrs. Brownlow's sister-in-law went to the cricket-match. Do you know, Robert really thought I had been there? <b>I</b> only <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>I</b> scored. I dare say Mrs. Coffinkey's sister- in-law knows." ...|$|R
