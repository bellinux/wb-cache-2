We have seen that independence is questionable at unclear cases in the auditor's relationship as an independent party.

5|$|The Grand Commandant's office {{witnessed}} {{significant changes}} during the Eastern Han. Wang Mang separated the regent's role from the Grand Commandant's post during the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD), {{since he did}} not want an active regent for his regime. This was retained by Eastern Han, while the third Grand Commandant of Eastern Han appointed in 51 AD transformed his ministry into a primarily civilian one. Although the Eastern-Han Grand Commandant shared the same salary-rank as the other two Excellencies who were nominally considered his equals, he was nonetheless given de facto privilege as the most senior civil official. However, his censorial jurisdiction now overlapped with the other two Excellencies (i.e. he was able to investigate the same officials in central and local government), who shared an advisory role to the emperor (policy suggestions could be submitted independently or jointly by all three cabinet members). His various <b>bureaus</b> <b>handled</b> appointment, promotion, and demotion of officials, population registers and agriculture, the upkeep of transportation facilities, post offices, and couriers, civil law cases, granary storage, and military affairs.

The message is based on a book code, and after thinking carefully she realises that the key to the code is the sonnet which she started and Peter completed in Gaudy Night. The decoded message says that Peter and Bunter have accomplished their mission, but their danger is now great and they must come home separately. They require assistance to get home, and the message says which routes they will be taking. By solving the cipher, Harriet has saved Peter's life, just as he once saved her life. The message also instructs Harriet, in the event of his death, to read the letter he left for her in his <b>bureau.</b> <b>Handling</b> the unopened letter, Harriet reflects ruefully on the years she spent avoiding Peter's proposals of marriage, when all she wants now is to be with him again.

25|$|Although some {{scholars}} have supported its creation under Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305), the office can first be definitely traced {{to the rule of}} Roman emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337), in 320. Constantine probably created it in an effort to limit the power of the praetorian prefect (praefectus praetorio), until then the Roman emperor's chief administrative aide. The magister supervised the palatine secretariat, divided into four bureaux, the sacra scrinia, each under a respective magister: the scrinium memoriae, the scrinium epistularum, the scrinium libellorum and the scrinium epistolarum Graecarum. The first <b>bureau</b> <b>handled</b> imperial decisions called annotationes, because they were notes made by the emperor on documents presented to him, and also handled replies to petitions to the emperor. The second handled correspondence with foreign potentates and with the provincial administration and the cities, the third dealt with appeals from lower courts and petitions from those involved in them, and the fourth handled the documents issued in Greek and the translation of Latin documents into Greek. Another important duty transferred to the office by Constantine was the supervision of the agentes in rebus, a corps of trusted messengers who also functioned as controllers of the imperial administration. Especially this control of the feared agentes, or magistriani, as they were colloquially known, gave the office great power. The office rose quickly in importance: initially ranked as a tribunus, by the end of Constantine's reign the magister was a full comes.|$|R

To accomplish this we have interviewed six persons representing the tourist information bureaus in Färjestaden, Kalmar, Tranemo, Visby and Norrköping.

40|$|Historically, the Conservation Commission has allied {{itself with}} other state, federal, and private {{agencies}} that {{are concerned with}} control and management of wildlife. It was suggested {{about a year ago}} that a Memorandum of Understanding, specifying the policy and procedure for bird control and rat and mouse control by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in Missouri, would be desirable. Subsequent discussion with Bureau representatives led to the conclusion that a formal memorandum of understanding was unnecessary. The primary purpose of such documents is to formalize operating procedures in states where the Bureau carries on a continuous control program rather than in those states where control essentially is a state function augmented only occasionally by the <b>Bureau</b> <b>handling</b> of special problems. Under existing procedures in Missouri, the state requests assistance from the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife only when faced with large scale bird control problems. When the Bureau receives requests for assistance through other channels the state is informed prior to initiation of action by the Bureau. Normally, the Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s action is advisory in nature and recommendations are made after joint inspection and consultation with state personnel. The persons or agencies applying control methods are responsible for obtaining the necessary permits from the Department of Conservation. This system occasionally results in some delay in processing requests for assistance, but we feel that it has been satisfactory in handling most of the bird control problems. It provides our Department a measure of surveillance on bird control activities (which have not been numerous), and prevents environmental contamination that might occur by indiscriminate use of chemical poisons, pesticides, and like materials...|$|R
