60|$|SYLVIA. How {{on earth}} did you <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> Did Mr. Conway tell you? I wish you played bridge. We really had rather a lark.|$|E
6000|$|He, gloomily: 'Well, I don't care to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> To my {{mind this}} sort of thing is decidedly unpleasant, though you treat it so lightly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> graft," [...] persisted Johnny. [...] "You've got {{no right}} to refuse. I've told you all about every man, woman and {{hitching}} post in Dalesburg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course, naturally, I don’t {{expect you}} to tell me where it is," [...] said Mr. Chalk, [...] "but I thought it might be {{interesting}} to <b>hear</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that’s</b> all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Carrie, and the rest, I don't {{wonder he}} is fussy. Why don't you tell right out, {{and not do}} it any more, if he don't want you to?" [...] said Polly, persuasively.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, the EFF's Eva Galperin told BusinessWeek {{magazine}} that [...] "Tor’s {{biggest problem is}} press. No one <b>hears</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time someone wasn't stalked by their abuser. They hear how somebody got away with downloading child porn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the hut, lookin' arter the grub. You'll come in an' have some, of course. But I'm coorious to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> b'ar. Was it {{far from}} here you met him?" ...|$|E
60|$|You {{have had}} it? Yes, I know you have. Never mind {{telling me about}} it. Stop. I don't want to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> strange presentiment you had the night your Aunt Eliza broke her leg. Don't let's bother with your experience. I want to tell mine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I say nothing,' {{observed}} Mr Pinch, cheerfully, 'I am wrong, and don't {{say what}} I mean, because I {{get a great}} deal of pleasure from it, and the means of passing some of the happiest hours I know. It led to something else the other day; but you will not care to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> I dare say?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{have been}} much, because Mary owns {{that they will}} be very poor. Here is her letter. I am so unhappy about it. Don't you {{remember}} <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Colonel Marrable who was in a horrible scrape about somebody's wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{cried the}} good lady, {{with a very}} roguish smile. [...] "I see how the land lies. Of course, of course, why shouldn't it? I {{remember}} <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> young man. I have heard about the Girdlestones also. African merchants {{they were in the}} City. You see I know all about you." ...|$|R
50|$|In September, Paul dies. Alongside {{his will}} comes {{a letter to}} his wife, asking her to give $1000 to Miss Wooley. When Harold <b>hears</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> he decides not to tell his mother and instead he fires the girl. Back with her family, they reflect that the rich cannot be battled with, {{especially}} when they are lawyers - Annie shall rest for a while.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lambert pleaded to be excused; but {{the ladies}} on no account would let dear George go away. No, positively, {{he should not}} go. They wanted to make {{acquaintance}} with their cousin. They must <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> dreadful battle and escape from the Indians. Tom Claypool came in and {{heard some of the}} story. Flora was listening to it with her handkerchief to her eyes, and little Miles had just said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes,--perhaps {{higher than}} ever. But {{it will take}} time. And in the {{meantime}} I am driven to fall back upon property intended for other purposes. That's the meaning of what you <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> place down in Sussex which I bought for Marie. I was so driven that I was obliged to raise forty or fifty thousand wherever I could. But that {{will be all right}} in a week or two. And as for Marie's money,--that, you know, is settled.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would not dare?..." [...] {{he says in}} a whisper. [...] "I tell you, friends, that there's {{nothing the}} present {{government}} would not dare. There was the Plaine Saint Mauve... Did you ever <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?...</b> little children fusilladed by the score... little ones, I say, and women with babies at their breasts ... weren't they innocent?... Five hundred innocent people butchered in La Vendee... until the Headsman sank--worn not... I could tell worse than that... for I know.... There's nothing they would not dare!..." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> prince Vladimir of Pskov {{attacked}} Ugaunians. Ugaunians and German crusaders fortified Odenpeh and avenged Russians, raiding {{lands of}} Pskov and Novgorod. After that Ugaunians went with crusaders, Livonians and Letts against Estonian pagan provinces Jerwia and Vironia. Prince Vladimir of Pskov sent messengers {{through all of}} Estonia to besiege Germans and Ugaunians at Odenpeh. Harrians and Oeselians came and even already baptized Sackalians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you came}} to my house when I wasn’t at home," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Vickers, in a trembling but sarcastic voice. [...] "I want to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That’s</b> what I’ve come for." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a TV Guide {{magazine}} article in March 2001, Mackenzie Astin, who played Andy Moffett on The Facts of Life from 1985-88, {{was asked about}} the reunion and he was quoted as saying: [...] "I keep <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> too. I hope it's not happening, because nobody's called me! If it does, I hope they do call." [...] Ultimately, Astin did not appear in the movie, neither did series regulars Cloris Leachman, George Clooney and Sherrie Krenn.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the end of}} the siege, {{in which}} I had served as a medical officer, I {{returned}} to England. A few months after I left, peace was made between England and France, and by its terms Dupleix had to restore Madras to the English. I hear that fighting has been going on ever since, the English and French engaging as auxiliaries to rival native princes; and especially that there was some hot fighting round Devikota. However, we shall <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> when we get there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't got no {{name for}} my novel. I {{intended}} to think one out to-night. I wrote this all of nights. And I don't {{read the first}} chapters, for they tell about my birth and my parentage and my early adventures. I'll just come down to {{what happened to me}} while you was away, because you'll be more anxious to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> All that's written here is true, jus' the same as if I told it to you, but I've put it into novel language because it seems to come easier to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I reckon she did, but I niver could rightly <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Mr. Gilfil was niver to be {{spoke to}} about her, {{and nobody else}} hereabout knowed anythin'. Howiver, she must ha' come over pretty young, for she spoke English {{as well as you}} an' me. It's them Italians as has such fine voices, an' Mrs. Gilfil sung, you never heared the like. He brought her here to have tea with me one afternoon, and says he, in his jovial way, [...] "Now, Mrs. Patten, I want Mrs. Gilfil to see the neatest house, and drink the best cup o' tea, in all Shepperton; you must show her your dairy and your cheese-room, and then she shall sing you a song." [...] An' so she did; an' her voice seemed {{sometimes}} to fill the room; an' then it went low an' soft, as if it was whisperin' close to your heart like.' ...|$|E
50|$|On 7 December, President Park's former aides, {{including}} ex-chief {{of staff}} Kim Ki-choon and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong, testified in the 2nd parliamentary <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> suspicions <b>that</b> Choi Soon-sil meddled in government affairs.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Sadler was {{loath to}} part with his guests. [...] "You are more {{interesting}} now than ever you were," [...] he said, [...] "and I want to <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> hermit business; you've just barely mentioned it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't keep interrupting, children, or {{we never}} shall get on," [...] said Frank, more anxious to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the boys <b>that</b> were than the girl that was not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, {{whoever you}} may be. Of course {{if we were}} turned into a lawn-tennis court and told to resist, say, your heavy cavalry, we'd be ridden {{off the face of}} the earth if we couldn't get away. We have neither the weight nor the drill for a charge. My horse, for instance, by English standards, is half-broken, and like all the others, he bolts when we're in line. But cavalry charge against cavalry charge doesn't happen often, and if it did, well--all our men know that up to a hundred yards they are {{absolutely}} safe behind this old thing." [...] He patted his revolver pouch. [...] "Absolutely safe from any shooting of yours. What man do you think would dare to use a pistol at even thirty yards, if his life depended oh it? Not one of your men. They can't shoot. We can. You'll <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> down the Park--further up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Immediately after, indeed on {{the very}} day of our arrival at the monastery the winter began in earnest with bitter cold and snowstorms so heavy and {{frequent}} that all the desert was covered deep. Very soon it became obvious to us that here we must stay until the spring, since to attempt to move in any direction would be to perish. With some misgivings we explained this to the abbot Kou-en, offering to remove to one of the empty rooms in the ruined part of the building, supporting ourselves with fish that we could catch by cutting a hole in the ice of the lake above the monastery, and if we were able to find any, on game, which we might trap or shoot in the scrub-like forest of stunted pines and junipers that grew around its border. But he would listen to no such thing. We had been sent to be their guests, he said, and their guests we should remain for so long as might be convenient to us. Would we lay upon them the burden of the sin of inhospitality? Besides, he remarked with his chuckle--"We who dwell alone like to <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> other great monastery called the World, where the monks are not so favoured as we who are set in this blessed situation, and where folk even go hungry in body, and," [...] he added, [...] "in soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{beginning}} of this chapter must mark {{a change in the}} standpoint from which the story is told. Hitherto the course of events has been recorded in the impersonal style of history. But henceforward I am able to rely on my own memory as well as on other people's evidence. [I do not desire to bore the reader or depreciate the story by the introduction of personal matters. It will be sufficient if, in the interests of coherency, I explain my connection with the Malakand Field Force. Having realised, that if a British cavalry officer waits till he is ordered on active service, he is likely to wait a considerable time, I obtained six weeks' leave of absence from my regiment, and on the 2nd of September arrived at Malakand as press correspondent of the PIONEER and DAILY TELEGRAPH, and in the hope of being sooner or later attached to the force in a military capacity.] It may be doubtful whether an historical record gains or loses value when described by an eye-witness. From the personal point of view, all things appear in a gradual perspective, according to the degree in which they affect the individual; and we are so prone to exaggerate the relative importance of incidents, which we see, over those we <b>hear</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> what the narrative gains in accuracy of detail, it may lose in justness of proportion. In so nice a question I shall not pronounce. I remember that the original object with which this book was undertaken, was to present a picture of the war on the North-West Frontier to the Englishmen at home; a picture which should not only exist, but be looked at; and I am inclined to think, that this end will be more easily attained by the adoption of a style of personal narrative. Many facts, too local, too specialised, too insignificant, for an historical record, and yet which may help the reader to form a true impression of the scene and situation, are thus brought within the compass of these pages. The account becomes more graphic if less imposing, more vivid if less judicial. As long as each step down from the [...] "dignity of history" [...] is accompanied by a corresponding increase in interest, we may pursue without compunction that pleasant, if descending, path.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring him here, and we'll <b>hear</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> from himself," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon. The major, before he started, {{told his mother}} that he should call at Framley Parsonage on his way back; but he said nothing on this subject to his father.|$|R
50|$|To {{those of}} us on the team {{fighting}} cancer, it may seem that some days, the challenge is too big, too tough. We <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> another friend, parent, or co-worker being diagnosed. We <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> those <b>that</b> make it, but a lot of times….. we unfortunately <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> those who don’t. In difficult times, we must remember that life’s challenges are not supposed to paralyze us and bring us down, but help us discover who we are and the changes we can become. So don’t just be good at something, challenge yourself to be great.|$|R
