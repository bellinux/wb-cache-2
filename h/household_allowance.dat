5000|$|The Helmers {{live in an}} unequal partnership, {{dominated}} by Torvald. Although he professes to love her, Torvald constantly chides Nora {{for what he calls}} her careless and childlike nature; he often calls her his [...] "doll". He proudly thinks of himself as the family's breadwinner and protector, but he remains unaware of the secret that Nora holds: she had saved him, when he had become seriously ill and very nearly destitute. Without his knowledge, she had borrowed a large sum of money so that he could temporarily retire and recuperate. She told him the money had been inherited from her family; in truth it had been a private loan from Nils Krogstad, one of Torvald's coworkers. Nora has been scrupulously repaying him in small installments skimmed from her <b>household</b> <b>allowance.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} that the same income can lead to different household decisions, depending on who the earner is, {{has led to an}} effort to replace the standard household model with the Ôcollective modelÕ, which recognises that a household’s decisions depend on the power balance between the husband and the wife. This article recognises that the power balance can, in turn, depend on the decisions made. A new Ôhousehold equilibriumÕ and its dynamics are described and it is shown that there can be multiple equilibria in female labour-supply, and that child labour can decline and rise as the wife’s power increases. The unitary model of the household, which had served mainstream economics well for a long time, has in recent times given way to a more fractious view of the household. This has been an outcome of theoretical advances, empirical investigations and anthropological insights. 1 It is, for instance, clear that how much say a woman has in the household can vary across households in the same region and with the same total income; and this could depend, for example, on how much income she contributes to the household’s total income. This recognition has enormous implications for the design of policy. It means that ÔhowÕ {{a certain amount of money}} is injected by government into households can influence the well-being of individuals significantly. Ten dollars given to the male head of the household and the same money given to his wife can have very different implications for not only the amount of tobacco and alcohol purchased by the household but on child labour, education and health (Kanbur and Haddad, 1994). When a series of policy changes in the United Kingdom – see Walker and Zhu (1999) for a description – from 1976 to 1979 caused the <b>household</b> <b>allowance</b> for children to be handed over to the women, instead of men, there was a rise in the expenditure on children’s clothings (Lundberg et al., 1997); for related accounts, see Hoddinott an...|$|E

Using hedonic regression methods and household micro data, we find that rent savings to public housing tenants are less targeted towards low-income <b>households</b> than housing <b>allowance.</b> In addition, low-income public housing tenants live in poorer, less educated and lower quality neighborhoods than similar low-income households in private rental housing. This suggests that place-based programs may lead to more segregation than tenant-based alternatives even when neighborhood mixing is an explicit aim of the program, as in Finland...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{analytical}} framework devoted to compare family size related {{tax credits and}} allowances. As a main result, we obtain that, in a social welfare context à la Atkinson and Bourguignon (1987), if tax credits and allowances are compared in an individual context, it could be assured that a progressive income tax with family size related tax allowances is never welfare superior to an equal-yield income tax involving tax credits. Theoretical results are checked on empirical grounds for the Spanish personal income tax (IRPF) in force in 1999. We develop a micro-simulation exercise, using the Panel of IRPF Returns, which belongs to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Two results {{can be derived from}} this exercise. Firstly, that, both adopting an individual or <b>household</b> approach, <b>allowances</b> and tax credits are welfare superior to an equal-yield proportional tax. And secondly, that, although a tax credit system reduces global income inequality more than what allowances does, also from an individual or household approach, {{it is not possible to}} determine superiority in welfare terms of a system over the other.

40|$|Treasurer Wayne Swan has {{delivered}} a budget with a A$ 19. 4 billion deficit this financial year, falling only to $ 18 billion in 2013 - 14. The government would aim {{to bring the}} budget back to “balance” – less than $ 1 billion in the black ­– in 2015 - 16, and have a modest $ 6. 6 billion surplus in 2016 - 17. The government’s unconventional pre-election budget – which includes {{a rise in the}} Medicare levy and a fresh crack down on “middle class welfare” – contains $ 43 billion of savings through the forward estimates and funding for the key schools and disability programs. It foreshadows a growing economy but a small rise in unemployment, to 5. 75 %, next financial year. Swan said the government had chosen to support “jobs and growth in an uncertain world,” rather than cutting to the bone. He said the budget would “chart a pathway to surplus through responsible savings. ” “To those who would take us down the European road of savage austerity, I say the social destruction that comes from cutting too much, too hard, too fast is not the Australian way,” he told parliament. The government will scrap the Baby Bonus from next year, while providing new support for the families of newborns through the Family Tax Benefit A. In another tightening, the existing “pause” of the indexation of the family payments system for upper income test limits will continue. These measures are in addition to the earlier announced cancellation of increases to the Family Tax Benefit that were due in July. The total changes to the family payments are worth nearly $ 5 billion over the budget period. In other cuts, a number of business tax loopholes will be closed and several areas of health spending will be tightened. The positive themes of the budget were putting in place the national disability scheme and the Gonski school funding plan, as well as heavily investing in nation-building infrastructure. “This budget will fully fund our share of DisabilityCare Australia, beyond the next decade,” Swan said. An increase in the Medicare levy from July 1 next year will part fund the scheme. Swan also said the budget fully funded the government’s schools program over the next decade, “meaning we can return the budget to surplus without leaving our children an education deficit. ” On infrastructure, he said the government would continue its ambitious program “with a new $ 24 billion investment in the next wave of nation building. “It’s critical to invest in both urban road and rail infrastructure,” he said. The government was investing in “transformational public transport projects”, including Brisbane’s Cross River Rail and Melbourne Metro. “These projects will change the way these cities work and allow them to grow into the future. ” The government also announced $ 12. 9 million to connect more local councils to the NBN and provide training for business and not-for-profit organisations in 20 regional NBN rollout sites. Nearly $ 100 million will go to a new farm <b>household</b> <b>allowance</b> to support farmers in hardship, part of the national drought program reform, {{and there will be a}} new farm finance package to help farmers struggling with debt. The government has loaded the weight of the savings it has identified into the later years of the forward estimates. Swan said that challenging global conditions and the high dollar had put “huge pressure on the budget, leading to a reduction in expected tax receipts in more than $ 60 billion over the four years to 2015 - 16. ” The budget forecasts growth for this financial year of 3 %, falling to 2. 75 % in 2013 - 14 before rising to 3 % in 2014 - 15. “Our nation’s outlook is bright and our economy is set to grow faster than most of the developed world,” Swan said, “By mid- 2015 our economy will be 22 % bigger than before the global financial crisis, outstripping every major advanced economy. ” He said the economy was undergoing an important transition. “Our nation’s largest resource investment boom is shifting to a boom in production and exports… as the resources boom enters its new phase, the economy is also transitioning to broader sources of economic growth. ” This brought opportunities, but the transition would not be seamless. He said despite the slight rise in unemployment, Australia would still have among the lowest unemployment rate in the developed world. The budget revised its earlier forecast of the carbon price dramatically down, to around $ 12 a tonne in 2015, when it moves to a floating system and is linked to the European price. The budget says the second round of the tax cuts, which had been due in 2015, would be deferred until the carbon price was estimated to be about $ 25. 40. This is currently projected to occur in 2018 - 19 it says. This article was originally published at The Conversation. Read the original article. Photo: bankutitimi/ Flick...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} {{to what extent}} family policies differently affect poverty among single-parent households and two-parent households. We distinguished between reconciliation policies (tested with parental leave {{and the proportion of}} unpaid leave) and financial support policies (tested with family allowances). We used data from the Luxembourg Income Study Database, covering 514, 019 households in 18 OECD countries from 1978 to 2008, combined with data from the Comparative Family Policy Database. Our findings suggest that single- and two-parent households {{are less likely to be}} poor in countries that have longer parental leave, a smaller proportion of unpaid leave, and higher amounts of family allowances. Most notably, family policies reduced poverty to a greater extent among single-parent households. Paid leave more effectively facilitated the employment of single parents, thereby reducing their poverty more than among two-parent <b>households.</b> Family <b>allowances</b> decreased the risk of poverty of single-parent households relative to two-parent households in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, while increasing this relative risk in for instance Luxembourg, France, Germany and Ireland. Nevertheless, in absolute terms, in most countries family allowances were found to reduce a larger share of the poverty among single-parent households than among two-parent households...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the birth rate and fertility rate in dependence on the economic conditions of the Czech Republic. The aim of this thesis is to analyze relations between selected socio-economic indicators and total fertility rate on the basis of available data and to evaluate changes related to birth and fertility in the Czech Republic, which occurred in the period 1993 - 2015. The thesis is divided into two main parts - theoretical and analytical. In the theoretical part are described the basic methods of calculating the characteristics for {{the analysis of the}} level of birthrate and fertility, as well as the development of selected socio-economic indicators. An important part of {{the first part of the}} diploma thesis is specification of used methods within time series. The second part is practically focused on cointegration analysis and subsequent assembly of single-row models from which error correction models were obtained by transformation. These can be used to describe short and long term relationships between time series. Explained variables are aggregate fertility in all assembled models, the explanatory variables are GDP, average gross monthly wage, final consumption expenditure for <b>households,</b> child <b>allowances,</b> parental <b>allowance</b> and <b>household</b> loans per capita...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a quarter}} of <b>households</b> receive fuel <b>allowances,</b> amounting to some £ 56 million, annually. The state {{distributes}} these allowances because fuel {{is regarded as a}} ?merit? good. We must question whether the allowances as they stand are the most efficient way alleviating fuel difficulties among low-income families. It is probably fair to say that they do not succeed sufficiently in alleviating discomfort and the problems mentioned above. It is warmth that families require, rather than fuel per se. By taking a wider perspective, which includes the option of installing energy conservation measures in the home, it is asked whether it would be possible for the State to provide more warmth for the current expenditure. The answer in technical terms is yes, but no in practical terms. However on the way, we describe a sensible scheme and point out some other measures for helping low-income households to enjoy more warmth. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts of meal voucher sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features of the Czech meal voucher scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison of the Czech meal voucher system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects of meal allowances on various income deciles, quantify the impact of meal allowances tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment of current meal allowances by flat meal allowances according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the meal allowances tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form of meal allowances widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent <b>households</b> receive meal <b>allowances</b> more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement of current meal allowances scheme by one with a flat meal allowances (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty is a {{fundamental}} characteristic of climate change. This paper focuses on uncertainty {{in the implementation of}} climate policy, especially as it affects the level and distribution of the burden on households that results from the allocation of emissions allowances. We examine the Waxman–Markey bill (H. R. 2454), introduced in the U. S. House of Representatives in 2009, with bookend scenarios labeled optimistic and pessimistic. The scenarios illustrate varied outcomes associated with allocations to electricity local distribution companies, investments in energy efficiency, and technology development. We introduce a third scenario for comparison, which allocates a substantial portion of allowance value directly to households as lump-sum payments. We find the average net household burden in 2016 in the optimistic scenario to be $ 133 with a CO 2 allowance price of $ 13. 19. In the pessimistic scenario, the net household burden rises to $ 418, with an allowance price of $ 23. 41. While the burden varies by income group, the relative impacts stay roughly the same in the optimistic and pessimistic cases, thus the uncertainty in average burdens does not carry over to uncertainty in the distribution of those burdens. Both scenarios impose the greatest burden as a percentage of income on middle-income <b>households.</b> Allocation of <b>allowance</b> value directly back to households as a lump-sum payment imposes an average net household burden of $ 206 with much less uncertainty in outcome; the distributional impacts are highly progressive. cap and trade, allocation, distributional effects, cost burden, equity, regulation,local distribution companies...|$|R

This research used survey method. The sampling technique used in {{this research}} was Simple Random Sampling. Respondents were 35 students of SMAN 2 Bandar Lampung and 37 students of SMAN 1 Tumijajar. The data were analyzed by quantitative description and verification analysis. The results showed that students 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the cassava snacks price, availability of cassava snacks, appearance and image of cassava snacks were considered normal. The students generally preferred cassava snacks with spicy flavor, strong cassava aroma and crunchy texture. The most preferred form of cassava snacks was chips. During a month, teenagers got energy from cassava snacks that the average is 86 kcal/day for teenagers in Bandar Lampung and 75 kcal/day for teenagers in Tumijajar. The average consumption frequence of cassava snacks by teenagers in Bandar Lampung is 1 - 2 times per month and 3 - 4 times per month by teenagers in Tumijajar. Type of cassava snacks that was consumed during the past month was cassava chips, klanting, combro, and tela-tela. Cassava snacks were obtained by purchasing in the shop or in the market, self cooking, and or providing by others. The factors that influence food consumption of cassava snacks are household income, number of teens allowance, environment gender and preferences.

30|$|Since direct {{income taxes}} {{are often the}} result of complex {{taxation}} systems, we disaggregate them into three components not {{all of which are}} necessarily present in all countries: tax schedules, tax allowances, and tax credits. Tax allowances and tax credits are so-called fiscal benefits and they may be an important channel through which the tax benefit system directs resources towards <b>households.</b> A tax <b>allowance</b> is any type of deduction from initial taxable income that would lower the effective tax base. This includes social insurance contributions whenever they are deductible from the tax base, as well as any tax bands where the tax rate is zero. A tax credit is any type of non-refundable deduction from the initial tax liability (gross tax). To effect the decomposition we take following approach. First, using EUROMOD, we estimate the gross tax (i.e. before any tax credits) payable in the baseline scenario. We then re-calculate gross tax when all tax allowances in the system (including social insurance contributions when deductible, 0 rate bands etc.) are removed, i.e. set to zero. The difference between the gross taxes calculated in the two scenarios provides a measure of the ‘value’ of tax <b>allowances</b> for each <b>household,</b> i.e. the amount of income each household gains via lower taxes due to the existence of tax allowances. We measure the size of tax schedules as the gross tax that would be payable in the absence of tax allowances. The size of this variable is driven by the tax schedule but also by other elements of the income tax system such as the extent to which various types of incomes are subject to taxation, joint vs. individual taxation, progressivity adjustments etc. In the remainder of the paper we will refer to the tax schedule/taxable base component of the income tax system as “taxes”. Finally, tax credits are the difference between gross and net taxes. Refundable tax credits are treated as benefits and thus included in the benefit concepts, not in tax credits, as explained above.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results for}} four separately estimated sets of discrete choice labour supply models using the Household Economic Surveys from 1991 / 92 up to 2000 / 01. The New Zealand working-age population {{is divided into}} sole parents, single men, single women, and couples. The labour supply models use imputed wages for the non-workers. Some of the preference parameters for work and income are made dependent on personal and household characteristics to allow for heterogeneity in preferences among <b>households.</b> In addition, <b>allowance</b> is made for unobserved heterogeneity in preferences. The estimated parameters for the different groups are used to calculate confidence intervals for expected labour supply and the probability of working at the different discrete hours points. The effect of particular characteristics on labour supply is illustrated by computing marginal effects across the samples. The wage elasticities fall {{within the range of}} values found in other studies. Expected labour supply, predicted by using the estimated models, results in values close to the observed averages and confidence intervals around the expected values are reasonably narrow in most groups. The results are as anticipated and similar to results in other countries, with preferences for work being higher for people with higher education, who are in their thirties. Furthermore, for women the presence of young children decreases the preference for work. In addition to these variables, which are usually included in labour supply models, the “eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation” indicator and a “living with parents” indicator are included. For all groups, the delayed eligibility for the state provided superannuation scheme is found to increase labour supply. The indicator for living with one’s parents is found to increase labour supply for sole parents (indicating that living with one’s parents may be a childcare strategy), although the effect was not significant.
