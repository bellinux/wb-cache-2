5|$|The first {{commercial}} recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual {{numbers from the}} Savoy operas. In 1917, the <b>Gramophone</b> Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by recordings of eight more of the operas. Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores {{of most of the}} operas were then issued by the <b>Gramophone</b> Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979. Between 1988 and 2003, after the company was revived, it recorded seven of the operas.|$|E

6000|$|There is, I cannot but suspect, in {{the mysterious}} {{activities}} that underlie life, some trade in records for these distinguished <b>gramophones,</b> {{and it is}} a trade conducted upon cheap and wholesale lines. There must be in these demiurgic profundities a rapid manufacture of innumerable thousands of that particular speech about [...] "scrappy reading," [...] and that contrast of [...] "modern" [...] with [...] "serious" [...] literature, that babbles about in the provinces so incessantly. <b>Gramophones</b> thinly disguised as bishops, <b>gramophones</b> still more thinly disguised as eminent statesmen, <b>gramophones</b> K.C.B. and <b>gramophones</b> F.R.S. have brazened it at us time after time, and will continue to brazen it to our grandchildren when we are dead and all our poor protests forgotten. And almost equally popular in their shameless mouths is the speech that declares this present age to be an age of specialisation. We all know the profound droop of the eminent person's eyelids as he produces that discovery, the edifying deductions or the solemn warnings he unfolds from this proposition, and all the dignified, inconclusive rigmarole of that cylinder. And it is nonsense from beginning to end.|$|R

5|$|Elgar {{has been}} {{described}} as the first composer to take the <b>gramophone</b> seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings of his works. The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval, touring in Europe and America with each, and making many recordings.

In June 1904 The <b>Gramophone</b> Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila, and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the first}} discographic records {{produced}} in Portugal {{date from the}} beginning of the 20th century, at this stage the national market was still very incipient since it was quite expensive to buy <b>gramophones</b> and records.

At the same time, <b>gramophones</b> started being made at more competitive prices. This created more favorable conditions for the market among the middle class.|$|R
