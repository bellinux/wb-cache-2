5|$|Although the {{hurricane}} season {{is defined as}} beginning on June1 and ending on November30, {{there have been several}} off-season storms. Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in <b>January,</b> <b>February</b> and March. During four years (1887, 1953, 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December. In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year. High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in <b>January,</b> <b>February,</b> and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} losses, the {{battalion}} {{did not return}} to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and {{is believed to have been}} first to reach the city on 4 August. During this time Major Arapeta Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice, although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September. In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza, for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order. The winter snow set in after this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action died down. Thus, throughout <b>January,</b> <b>February</b> and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} {{territory}} {{there are only two}} distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures. The coldest month is <b>January</b> (<b>February</b> on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia. The continental interiors are the driest areas.|$|E
25|$|Between Jordan's {{departure}} in 1998 and Gordon's {{arrival in}} 2004, the Bulls {{did not win}} more than 30 games in a single season. In his rookie year, Gordon helped lead a turnaround from a 3–14 start to finish 47–35 and secure the third seed in the playoffs. He averaged 15.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game while playing 24.2 minutes per game. Gordon also finished with 21 double-digit fourth quarter point performances, second to only LeBron James' 22 in the NBA. In their first playoff appearance in the post-Jordan era, the Bulls (without Luol Deng) lost to the Washington Wizards in six games. After the season, Gordon became the first rookie in NBA history to be awarded the NBA Sixth Man Award. Gordon was also the NBA's Eastern Conference Rookie of The Month 3 times (<b>January,</b> <b>February,</b> and March), and was also voted onto the NBA All-Rookie First Team.|$|E

After some stumbles in December, he hit good form in January, averaging 21.2 points and 6.7 rebounds over a 15-game stretch as he became the starting center {{in place for the}} injured O'Neal, recording a career-high 31 points against Chicago in the process. O'Neal was then traded to Miami during the All-Star break, allowing the Italian to regain his starting spot {{for the rest of the}} season. He averaged 19.8, 17.9 and 20.3 points per game for <b>January,</b> <b>February</b> and March respectively, even as Toronto went on several losing streaks and gradually fell out of the playoff race. The Raptors concluded the regular season with 33 wins, and ranked 13th in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, Bargnani recorded career-high averages in points per game, field goal percentage, three-point percentage, rebounds and blocks. On 8 July 2009, he signed a contract extension with the Raptors that will pay him US$50 million over five seasons, starting in 2010–11.|$|E
