5|$|Within {{the family}} Accipitridae, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{is a member}} of the large genus Accipiter, which {{consists}} of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species' name dates back to the Middle English word sperhauk and Old English spearhafoc, a hawk which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk,</b> sparrhaukr, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England. English folk names for the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> include blue hawk, referring to the adult male's colouration, as well as hedge hawk, spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{include the}} barn owl, the tawny owl, the {{northern}} goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E
500|$|Male <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> {{regularly}} kill birds {{weighing up}} to [...] and sometimes up to females can tackle prey up to [...] or more. The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily {{is estimated to}} be [...] for males and [...] for females. During one year, a pair of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> could take 2,200house sparrows, 600common blackbirds or 110wood pigeons. Species that feed in the open, far from cover, or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration, are taken more often by <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks.</b> For example, great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> may account for more than 50% of deaths in certain species, but the extent varies from area to area.|$|R

50|$|Male <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> {{regularly}} kill birds {{weighing up}} to 40 g and sometimes up to 120 g; females can tackle prey up to 500 g or more. The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily {{is estimated to}} be 40 - 50 g for males and 50 - 70 g for females. During one year, a pair of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> could take 2,200 house sparrows, 600 common blackbirds or 110 wood pigeons. Species that feed in the open, far from cover, or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration, are taken more often by <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks.</b> For example, great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> may account for more than 50% of deaths in certain species, but the extent varies from area to area.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{population}} in Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|The musket, or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> because of its size. The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk.</b> As {{with other members of}} its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.|$|E

5|$|Body {{tissue samples}} from <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000–2005.|$|R
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk.</b> Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, {{the species}} almost became extinct in East Anglia, where the {{chemicals}} were most widely used; in western and northern {{parts of the}} country, where the pesticides were not used, there were no declines. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire {{because it was the}} only <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> breeding site left in the English Midlands.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk's</b> pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|R
500|$|In Great Britain, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> living {{further north}} {{are bigger than}} their more southerly counterparts, with wing length (the most {{reliable}} indicator of body size) increasing {{by an average of}} [...] in males, and [...] in females, for each degree further north.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{is a major}} {{predator}} {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of habitat is dictated by these requirements. It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{is a small}} bird of prey with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to {{manoeuvring}} through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The northern goshawk and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E
50|$|Several insect, {{bird and}} other animals have been {{recorded}} on the site. Birds include <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks,</b> common sandpipers, long-tailed tits, red-legged partridges, Eurasian skylarks, mallards, greater white-fronted geese and meadow and tree pipits. However the only amphibian found is the common frog.|$|R
50|$|The Greysouthen area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} bird species including northern lapwings, common snipes, Eurasian curlews, common woodpigeons, buzzards, Eurasian oystercatchers, common pheasants, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks,</b> and quail. Red squirrels are also found. Orange tips, red admirals, and painted lady butterflies occur within the area.|$|R
50|$|In Great Britain, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> living {{further north}} {{are bigger than}} their more southerly counterparts, with wing length (the most {{reliable}} indicator of body size) increasing {{by an average of}} 0.86 mm in males, and 0.75 mm in females, for each degree further north.|$|R
5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk,</b> common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, as Falco nisus, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current scientific name {{is derived from the}} Latin accipiter, meaning 'hawk' and nisus, the sparrowhawk. According to Greek mythology, Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple lock of hair to present to her lover (and Nisus' enemy), Minos.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to wipe out the northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
500|$|A {{study of}} female <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> found [...] "strong evidence" [...] that their rate of {{survival}} increased {{for the first}} three years of life, and declined for the last five to six years. Senescence (ageing) was the cause of the decline as the birds became older.|$|R
500|$|Racing pigeon {{owners in}} Great Britain have said {{for many years}} that <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> and {{peregrine}} falcons [...] "cause serious and escalating losses" [...] of pigeons and some have called for these birds of prey to be killed or removed from areas surrounding homing pigeon lofts.|$|R
500|$|Waxwings are preyed upon by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} rough-legged buzzards, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawks,</b> prairie falcons, and great grey shrikes. Merlins attack winter flocks, including those in cities. When alarmed, Bohemian waxwings [...] "freeze" [...] with bill and neck pointing upwards. If this fails, they fly, calling noisily.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the goldcrest's range, {{the main}} {{predator}} of small woodland birds is the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk,</b> {{which has a}} diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only very rarely been recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillars and beetles, {{although in}} autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young are fed mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree trunks and large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, {{as well as}} when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>sparrowhawk.</b>|$|E
