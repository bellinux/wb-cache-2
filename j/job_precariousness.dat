In the 1970s many people used to work for a few months, then to go away for a journey, then back to work for a while. This was possible in times of almost full employment and in times of egalitarian culture. This situation allowed people to work in their own interest and not in the interest of capitalists, but quite obviously this could not last forever, and the neoliberal offensive of the 1980s was aimed to reverse the rapport de force."

Despite the difficulty in researching immigrant populations, {{there is evidence that}} occupational health is an area in which immigrants face disparities. Many migrant or foreign-born workers fill low-wage, temporary or seasonal work in industries and jobs that may pose greater risks for worker health and safety such as agriculture, construction and services. In the United States, agriculture sector occupational risks such as asthma are more likely to affect immigrant workers. Overall, immigrants have higher rates of occupational morbidity and mortality than those who are native born, including higher rates of fatal and non-fatal injury. Evidence from Southern Europe points to higher rates of occupational risks such as working many hours per day and extreme temperatures and greater exposure to poor employment conditions and <b>job</b> <b>precariousness.</b> Health prevention and training programs related to occupational safety and health may not reach immigrants due to language, cultural and/or economic barriers. An emerging occupational health issue for immigrants relates to the health risks faced by people who are trafficked into situations of forced labor and debt bondage.|$|E

The authors believe that the transitions from school to work provide an ideal opportunity to study such processes. The research took place in the Spanish village of Colindres from 2013 to 2015. We developed the investigation through an anthropological methodolo gy and used different tools as longitudinal interviews and ethnographic fieldwork. In this way, we selected high school students who share significant features related to their family origins and formative period. The authors conclude by discussing how the salaried classes impose upon themselves those labour mechanics and techniques applied by advocates of neoliberal policies: <b>job</b> insecurity, salary <b>precariousness,</b> labour mobility, time flexibility, and job rotation. In this case, we have found that family, peer group and close community in Colindres establish a framework in which young people naturally learn how to face up to their precarious labour experiences without conflict. Finally, the labour marketplace obtains what it needs: an adult who makes his own free decisions as a precarious worker and a low-level consumer...|$|R

A general worsening of job quality and under-qualification practises for new entrants are amongst the most marked features. Italian and French comparison shows how conjectural and structural factors force them to face precariousness with strategies based on personalised trajectories. Objective: The study aims at showing how precariousness affect youth careers and which dynamics they activate to achieve professional and personal expectations. We plan to explain how job precarity and life uncertainty concern subjective dimension, which depends on both socio-demographic characteristics and temporal-geographical perspective. Method: We shall investigate youth employment conditions through standardized dimensions and subjective perceptions. Cross-sectional analysis based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions will provide quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews of Italian and French people aged 20 - 35 having different levels of education, social origin and gender. Results: In Italy and France, both the level of education and familial background occurred to explain intergenerational inequalities in work trajectories. In both countries, women are more educated and look for fulfilling jobs. They are more likely to use training to keep developing their abilities and accept temporary jobs. Men suffer more the lack of job continuity and perceive spells in unemployment like a personal defeat. They are oriented to economic satisfaction around their thirties. Active policies are factors boosting job attachment although widespread disaffiliation feelings, which are more evident among youth from lower social classes and living in the Southern regions of both countries. Conclusion: Because of <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> and life uncertainty young people develop individual mechanisms to achieve a compromise between creative dynamic work search and passive acceptation of <b>job</b> <b>precariousness...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the notion that the nature of current labor market informalization {{requires}} rethinking in order to guide action and formulate social policies for eliminating poverty and reducing economic inequality and job insecurity. It explores conceptually and empirically the dynamics of informality and demonstrates the interconnectedness of <b>job</b> <b>precariousness,</b> vulnerability and gender relations. There are five related aspects to this process of informalization that are explored in the conceptual framework namely: 1) increasing labor market flexibilization; 2) the weakening (even absence) of the labor contract; 3) rising income inequality and worker differentiation; 4) institutional questions related to ownership and appropriation of production; and 5) gender-related socially ascribed positions in society and within the household. The empirical section {{is based on}} the 2002 sample survey data of poor urban households engaged in home-based work collected in Bolivia and Ecuador as part of a four-country research project that attempts to understand the roles of financial and labor resources in the coping strategies of urban poor households as their countries undergo rapid global market integration, financial crises and economic restructuring. Using employment and decisionmaking information on heads and spouses in the Bolivian and Ecuador sample data, the empirical investigation provides a gendered analysis of the informalization of employment among men and women respondents in couples (or dual adults) households to highlight the interconnectedness of <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> and gendered relations. Specifically, we adopt a gendered approach in examining the link between gender-based roles and relations with worker vulnerability. The findings in the study points to the importance of rethinking social protection program for workers laboring in informalized settings. It concludes with a discussion of lthe different possible avenues for action to dealing with poverty and redressing regressive tendencies in the distribution of income and resources in the informal economy. ...|$|E

O estudo é descritivo, com aplicação de questionário aos responsáveis pela emergência de oito hospitais. A superlotação das emergências é constante e as causas apontadas são a baixa resolutividade da atenção básica e a precariedade da rede hospitalar. Seis hospitais não gerenciam a superlotação. A porta de entrada não é organizada e apenas três hospitais fazem classificação de risco. Foram verificadas dificuldades de relacionamento internas e externas, demonstrando um isolamento da emergência em relação à rede e ao próprio hospital. As patologias difíceis de encaminhar para o sistema são as crônicas, neurológicas e sociais. Em relação às equipes, a precariedade dos vínculos dificulta a fixação do profissional e sua qualificação Os profissionais não têm capacitação específica e só um serviço utiliza protocolos.

In particular, I look at the ways in which changing forms of work and employment have affected workers' access to social security, contributory benefits and non-contributory grants. The dissertation analyses two case studies (workers in the glass, paper and metal industry in the East Rand and Johannesburg municipal employees) by focusing on how rising unemployment, <b>job</b> losses, <b>precariousness</b> and casualisation impact on employees' social provisions. The research is connected to theoretical debates that, in the developed and the developing world, have emphasised the importance of the waged condition and of labour movements in expanding social security as part of the broader concept of social citizenship. In classical theorisations, from T. H. Marshall to G. Esping-Andersen, social citizenship defines a generation of rights premised on decommodification, or the provision of social goods (including pensions, unemployment benefits, housing, healthcare and municipal services) as entitlements aimed at minimising individual dependence on the labour market. The concept of decommodification underpins this dissertation. My analysis of the relationships between wage labour and social citizenship in South Africa is ultimately an inquiry {{of the ways in which}} wage labour and working class organisations have been able to deepen and widen the decommodification of workers’ livelihoods. This conceptual perspective is particularly relevant to the South African case, especially in consideration of the decisive role played by organised labour both in contributing to the downfall of apartheid and in spearheading post-apartheid democratic institutions and progressive social policies. The historical role of organised labour in the South African transition was not confined to workplace issues and unionised workers' concerns, but it also emphasised broader demands for social citizenship rights, decommodified provisions and a politics of community-based alliances. Influential scholarly works have often characterised these aspects under the heading of "social movement unionism". In a post-apartheid scenario, social movement unionism is increasingly embattled due to rising unemployment and "atypical" employment, and to the adoption of market-orientated socioeconomic policies by the post- 1994 African National Congress government. Labour's ability to promote agendas for decommodification and social citizenship are concurrently facing uncomfortable realities and problematic questions. Has wage labour fulfilled its "promise" to be a vehicle to expand the social rights of the working class and the poor? In which ways are employment and labour market changes affecting organised labour's ability to expand areas of societal decommodification? Are alternative identities and social citizenship discourses emerging in response to the crisis of stable employment? I address these questions by looking at workers' responses to the crisis of wage labour as emerging in case studies “from below”, and at the ways in which such responses are framed and elaborated within the post- 1994 social policy discourse. A second component of my research, therefore, is based on interviews with policy-makers and documentary analysis on the development of social policy from 1994 to 2001, which emphasise shifting policy discourses on the wage laboursocial citizenship interaction. In the final analysis, social citizenship emerges from this work not merely as a static construct, centred on programmes and institutions, but as a terrain of negotiations and a "contested field of signification", shaped by the encounter of institutional narratives and meanings defined by grassroots agency. The result of the research confirms that concepts of "social citizenship" and "wage labour" are profoundly shaped by contradictions determined by underlying social contestation. In fact, respondents in my case studies clearly perceive the crisis of stable, dignified employment as a structural reality that requires systemic policy interventions. On the other hand, no homogenous discourse is emerging in workers’ narratives to challenge deeply entrenched views of inclusion and the social order as based on waged employment. Decommodification discourses, as for example advanced by new social movements, remain therefore substantially limited. Conversely, the policy discourse of democratic South Africa responds to the crisis, when not the actual disappearance, of wage labour as a social reality with an aggressive reassertion of work ethic and wage discipline as vehicles of social insertion and moral virtue. The ANC government often combines these arguments with a clear rejecton of decommodification, often presented as "dependency" on welfare "handouts", which undermines individual incentives for productive jobseeking behaviours. The contradictions between the crisis of wage labour in social practices and modes of reproduction, and the reasserted centrality of wage labour in the policy discourse as the main modality of social citizenship and inclusion opens new directions for research and interrogates changing forms of social identities, contestation and political legitimacy in the South African transition...|$|R
40|$|Au cours de la dernière décennie, {{plusieurs}} auteurs se sont interrogés sur les facteurs qui ont fait chuter le taux de syndicalisation dans certains pays et qui sont à la source de sa stagnation dans d'autres. Parmi les facteurs de nature structurelle, le déplacement des emplois de la grande entreprise vers la petite entreprise, de l'entreprise publique vers l'entreprise privée, du secteur manufacturier vers le secteur des services constituent ceux qui reviennent le plus souvent. Dans la foulée de la restructuration des services, on peut constater au Québec comme dans d'autres pays occidentaux, un mouvement en faveur de nouvelles formes d'organisation sociale visant la production de biens et services. Ces organisations prennent la forme de petites entreprises communautaires du secteur des services privés, ajoutant ainsi à la masse de salariés, pour la plupart non syndiqués, de ce secteur. Cet article vise à évaluer le potentiel de syndicalisation des salariés du communautaire. Cette évaluation qualitative est faite à partir de données recueillies lors d'entrevues dans six entreprises types du secteur communautaire dans l'Outaouais, de commentaires rassemblés lors de réunions de groupes focus d'informateurs-clé et de rencontres avec des représentants syndicaux. Les données sont analysées à l'aide d'un modèle explicatif de la propension à se syndiquer. Suivent quelques considérations stratégiques pour les organisations syndicales intéressées par la syndicalisation de ces groupes de salariés. The {{union density}} of private services workers is clearly {{lower than that}} of other categories of organizations. The average for Canada as a whole is 40 %, while that for personal services workers is less than 11 %. The situation is, to say the least, disturbing for unions, which have difficulty organizing these continually growing groups of workers. Community organizations {{do not appear to be}} exceptions to the major extrinsic rules of labour relations in the private services sector, with wages lower than the national average, an absence of <b>job</b> security, <b>precariousness</b> and low union density. Since the early 1980 s, these organizations have multiplied, for example, in the areas of job rcadiness, employment entry, health and social services, and so on. Even though these organizations have a social mission, provide services to members, function democratically, and are non-profit, they are nevertheless characterized by management-worker relations in the sociological and legal sense of the term, entalling an employment relationship that is the basis of unionization. There are appoximately 60, 000 paid jobs in the community and association movement in Quebec, including organizations involved in the defense of social rights and popular education, health and social services, child care, housing and recreation. In the absence of research into the unionization of community workers, the theoretical basis of this paper draws on the analytic elements developed by Wheeler for explaining the propensity to unionize and, from there, to build our own conceptual framework. Dissatisfaction is taken as the point of departure for the process leading to unionization. This dissatisfaction may result from working conditions considered to be inappropriate, a particular management style, or specific incidents that give rise to frustration. Feeling dissatisfied, frustrated, or even aggressive, the worker looks for a way to improve his or her situation. Several options are avallable. Economic theory predicts that the worker may decide to do nothing and put up with the situation, to leave the organization, or to put forward his or her point of view. If they decide to act, workers may do so individually, presenting their problem to management in the hope of solving it, or they may see the union as a tool that can be used to express dissatisfaction. The instrumental evaluation by the worker in large part depends on subjective elements that go well beyond the simple framework of objective utility. Thus, in order to fully appreciate workers' evaluations, their attitudes towards unions must be considered, that is, their beliefs and values regarding the movement itself (the affective dimension) as well as their individual perception of what they may gain or lose by unionizing (the instrumental dimension). Finally, a union must be willing to extend membership to the workers and offer them services to assist them in the process of unionizing. However, some unions have very restrictive policies in this regard. The elements of this explanatory model were studied in field research conducted in three consecutive stages between May 1997 and May 1998. While the first two stages examined the propensity to unionize, the third examined the supply of union services. The study's first stage involved field work in six community services organizations in the Outaouais region. In each organization, the researchers interviewed the person in charge of administration and, depending on the size of the organization, between one and three workers. The information gathered in the first stage was then explored in more depth during the second stage of the field work through three discussion groups with community workers. Finally, in the third stage, the supply of union services was examined through six individual interviews with representatives of the two major labour federations in Quebec. Examination of the comments made by employees in interviews and group discussions regarding their needs at work reveals that employees are generally satisfied with the team-based management of work and the autonomy enjoyed in carrying out their tasks. On the whole, our analysis brought out four major sources of dissatisfaction: (1) relations with the board of directors, in which the workers have little involvement in decision-making; (2) extrinsic working conditions, particularly salaries and benefits; (3) the funding of organizations; and (4) the work itself. Internai mechanisms for raising and solving problems that give rise to dissatisfaction are rare, although in some organizations employees are consulted directly regarding wage determination. On this latter point, it also seems important to emphasize that many sources of dissatisfaction lie beyond the boundaries of the community organization. In fact, low wages, poor working conditions, understaffing and job instability are elements of dissatisfaction that are in very large part related to insecurity and lack of funding sources, which are external to the organization. This has a bearing on the evaluation of attitudes towards unions and the instrumental dimension. The analysis of attitudes towards unions revealed that the beliefs and values of community workers are compatible with unionism. As a whole, both the managers, as well as the unionized and non-unionized workers interviewed, share the general values of the union movement and believe in its social relevance. However, they do not see unions as appropriate in the community sector, even though they believe that it is necessary to have an institution that plays a role similar to that played by a union. At first glance, it seems that the image held by workers of the effects of a union presence stand in the way of their willingness to unionize. In this study, the supply of union services, the third and final component of the framework used to analyze the unionization process, has two dimensions: the existence of union supply; and the particular form of union services offered. The interview data revealed that unions are very much aware of the specificity of community organizations as compared to private and public sector organizations. These characteristics serve to diminish the enthusiasm of unions, and cause others to reject outright the possibilities of organizing in this sector. None of the union officiais interviewed work for a union that is taking the lead in organizing this group of workers. The majority are content to wait for requests and to deal with such requests according to the criteria already mentioned. A minority simply refuse to organize in the community sector for reasons related to the number of workers concerned, the costs involved or the organizationai mission. Thus the union supply is relatively limited when it comes to unionizing community workers. Such workers must normally initiate the demand and approach the right union organizations, and the latter must perceive the group and the organization that employs them as viable. The specificity of community organizations can also affect the form of supply in that union representatives consider it essential to adapt union demands to the specific needs of the workers and community organizations. Certain demands that are proposed fit in well with the needs of these workers. However, none of the union officiais interviewed mentioned the issues of inflexibility that were referred to by so many of the workers. For their part, judging from the comments made during interviews and discussion groups, the workers do not appear to be aware that unions are willing to adapt their demand strategy to the particularities of the community sector. Rather, their opinions are influenced by their observation of labour relations in the much larger health and social services sector. Thus, the form of union supply and how it is perceived by community workers also have a negative influence on their willingness to unionize. The results of the empirical measurement of the constructs that make up the explanatory model of the unionization process lead us to conclude that, as a whole and according to the situation as it was at the time of this study, the probability of unionizing community workers is low. Although an examination of the needs of this group of workers suggests that they would have a high propensity to unionize, this assumption is quickly undermined by the workers' perceptions of the utility of unionization. In fact, although these workers have a large number of unsatisfied needs at work, most of them do not believe that unionizing will help them to improve their situation. Several aspects of supply of union services also help reduce the potential of unionization. In addition to being limited due to various inherent constraints, it is only partially congruent with the needs of community workers. There is also a strong perception among these same workers that union services are not well suited to their situation. The changes in the provision of health and social services in Quebec created by the trend towards ambulatory care could, however, have a positive effect on the propensity to unionize in the community sector. Indeed, during the past few years, many community organizations have experienced an appreciable increase in their funding base and in the number of workers they employ. Often this comes with control mechanisms regarding the mission of the organization and how its services are delivered. AH this is leading to significant change in these organizations. This may result in a degree of alienation among workers regarding the objectives of the organization and the services that it provides, thus partly countering the normative control referred to above. The increase in the number of employees also involves a degree of formalization of labour relations. However, as we have already seen, fear of the formalism brought about by unionization is one of the factors that contributes to resistance to unionization. Once established in the organization by management, this obstacle obviously diminishes accordingly. In light of the analytical elements presented in this article, as well as the additional discussions with union representatives and workers in the sector, we believe that it is possible to develop a union strategy to increase the potential of unionizing community workers. At the outset, this strategy should target certain community organizations and be based on realistic demands adapted to their needs as well as include organization and demand structures that are suited to the reality of community organizations. Due to their more stable funding base, labour relations that are often more impersonal and greater union viabiliry, organizations with a larger number of employees should be targeted first. The organizing campaign initiated by the union itself could be carried out on the basis of a set of issues identified through contacts with employees who are representative of the environment. Once the issues are identified, credible demands can then be developed, demands that then become a springboard to unionization. The relatively recent breakthroughs by the CSN in the day-care sector and the structures of representation they have put in place also provide interesting possibilities for unionization in the community sector. A lo largor de la ultima década, varios autores se han interrogado sobre los factores que han llevado a la caìda del porcentaje de sindicalizaciòn en varios paises y que son a la base de la paralizacion en otros.

Dentro de la nueva ola de la reestructuraciòn de los servicios podemos constatar en Québec como en otros paises occidentales, un ovimiento en favor de las nuevas formas de organizaciòn social que tienen como objetivo la producciòn de bienes y servicios.

The present research studies {{the way in which}} female work has been employed on different and nearly always inferior terms to male work, whether quantitatively or qualitatively. In most cases wages have been lower, periods of qualification and dequalification more unfavourable, and contract terms generally less secure than for male workers. The combination of these aspects of women work conditions has resulted in what will be called <b>job</b> <b>precariousness.</b> <b>Job</b> <b>precariousness</b> is adopted as a paradigm for an in-depth analysis of women’s working conditions. Women (like immigrants) have always experienced considerably worse working conditions than men throughout the capitalist industrial age. Even in the “Golden Age” of the 20 th century (1945 - 1975), considered by most sociologists and economists “the era of job stability”, women’s working conditions were worse than men’s and can be defined precarious. Women in Bolognese industry are not an exception. The dissertation will show how many women’s jobs in industry were the opposite of stable and therefore can be called precarious in the period of 1950 s and 1960 s, when the Italian economy experienced the most intense economic and industrial growth of the 20 th century. The comparison between female and male work conditions will address several aspects related to job precariousness: duration and continuity of work, salary variability, forms of discrimination and the relation between contract and social rights. In addition, attention will be paid to the forms of contract, gender-specific forms of discrimination and material working conditions of women. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} to measure precarious employment with a multidimensional approach. The adjusted multidimensional precariousness rate employed to measure <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> is calculated on a counting approach and exhibit several advantages, including its decomposability {{according to the}} relative contribution to total precariousness of different dimensions and sub-populations. For illustrative purposes, the methodology {{is applied to the}} Spanish case using microdata from the Encuesta de Estructura Salarial (Wage Structure Survey) and considering three precariousness dimensions of jobs (low wages, fixed-term contracts and part-time work). The evidence obtained shows that {{at the beginning of the}} economic crisis there was an increase in the incidence and intensity of precariousness for new jobs created in the Spanish economy. Moreover, obtained evidence shows that the incidence of precarious employment is particularly high in certain economic sectors and for females. This study has received funding from Spain’s Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project CSO 2014 - 55780 -C 3 - 2 -P) and from Autonomous Community of Madrid and European Commission (Project S 2015 /HUM- 3416 -DEPOPOR-CM) ...|$|E
40|$|During the {{globalization}} {{of the economy and}} of the financial exchanges, the so-called “emergent” countries have seen companies and job rates increasing. Anthropotechnological studies have shown failures in many technology transfers from countries of the "North" towards countries of the "South" during the 80 ´s and the 90 ´s. What is the current state of these movements today? Moreover, do the relocations bring new stakes and processes similar to these technology transfers? These evolutions impacted directly on the companies’ structure and organization, producing different development levels concerning the scope of the management when compared with the organization and execution domains. The "success" of the upgrade on the finance world, the marketing and the management, according to current criteria in developed countries, contrasts with the world of the production and the execution that continues to face contrasting situations in terms of technical and organizational reliability and precarious working conditions with important risks for health, safety, <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> and expertise development. To act on the imbalances between these two spheres that coexist without working together and that "split" the companies in two distinct and distant parts, therefore constitutes one of the major stakes in the sustainable development of work systems...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{incidence}} of high indebtedness or financial stress among urban, poor households in Ecuador and demonstrates its relation {{with the quality of}} employment. We argue that informalisation of employment, and in particular <b>job</b> <b>precariousness,</b> have consequences on other dimensions of vulnerability such as high debt servicing and financial stress. The empirical analysis is based on a 2002 sample survey data of men and women workers in urban poor communities of Ecuador. By employing an index of job quality, we investigate and compare the job quality of women and men workers in these households and find gender-based patterns with women working in relatively low quality jobs compared to men. Moreover, there seems to be differentiated levels of debt servicing among women and men that suggests uneven debt burden sharing among household members. By means of regression analyses, the paper demonstrates that low quality jobs tend to lead to higher debt servicing. The results provide a nuanced and illuminating picture of the interconnectedness of employment, financial stress and vulnerability. Copyright The Author 2010.

40|$|Background : Growing {{economic}} uncertainty {{has become}} an intrinsic characteristic of contemporary globalized societies in which {{an increasing number of}} people are moving in and out of jobs that may give little meaning to their lives. Among other things, economic uncertainty may affect union formation practices. Objective : In this study we address the relationship between employment uncertainty and union formation in Italy. The country typifies a unique case-study in light of its familistic organization, but remains largely under-studied in this respect. Methods : We adopt a mixed-method approach. The qualitative analysis - conducted with focus group techniques - provided an in-depth understanding into the mechanisms of how <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> may affect individual perceptions and beliefs on union formation in Italy. The quantitative analysis - conducted through event-history techniques - verified how strong these mechanisms are at the population level. Results : The qualitative exploration allows us to advance the hypothesis - new for the Italian setting - that labor market uncertainty favors cohabitation while employment stability facilitates marriage. The subsequent quantitative analysis provided strong support for this hypothesis for the female population. For men, the largest contrast was found between any work and no work. Contribution : Our findings support the idea that in Italy cohabitation - in contrast to marriage - is more compatible with employment uncertainties of today's labor market. These reflections are valid for women and employed men: When faced with uncertain prospects, they seem to prefer cohabitation to marriage in the light of its more uncertain nature. Alternatively, they might decide to postpone marriage until their outlook on life is more optimistic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{there has}} been a {{sizeable}} empirical literature measuring the effect of <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> on the mental health of workers the debate is still open, and understanding the true nature of such relationship has important policy implications. In this paper, we investigate the impact of precarious employment on mental health using a unique, very large data set that matches information on job contracts for over 2. 7 million employees in Italy followed over the years 2007 – 2011, with their psychotropic medication prescription. We examine the causal effects of temporary contracts, their duration and the number of contract changes during the year on the probability of having one or more prescriptions for medication to treat mental health problems. To this end, we estimate a dynamic Probit model, and deal with the potential endogeneity of regressors by adopting an instrumental variables approach. As instruments, we use firm-level probabilities of being a temporary worker as well as other firm-level variables that do not depend on the mental illness status of the workers. Our results show that the probability of psychotropic medication prescription is higher for workers under temporary job contracts. More days of work under temporary contract as well as frequent changes in temporary contract significantly increase the probability of developing mental health problems that need to be medically treated. We also find that moving from permanent to temporary employment increases mental illness; symmetrically, although with a smaller effect in absolute value, moving from temporary to permanent employment tends to reduce it. Policy interventions aimed at increasing the flexibility of the labour market through an increase of temporary contracts should also take into account the social and economic cost of these reforms, in terms of psychological wellbeing of employees...|$|E
40|$|The {{de-industrialisation}} of the UK economy {{caused by}} globalised international markets, advancements {{in technology and}} production with changing consumer demands have made much of what was ‘traditional’ manufacturing redundant; {{this has led to}} industrial restructuring or even collapse, resulting in mass job redundancies. Market and industrial pressures have intensified since the late 1990 s, culminating in the symbolic collapse of MG Rover in 2005 in addition to other key producers in the West Midlands, which represented the end of mass automotive production in the region (Donnelly et al. 2012). This came alongside various geographical, political and economic factors, including the restructuring of regional development agencies, prolonged industrial decline and a period of national economic recession, which presented challenges for any recovery. This thesis examines more precisely the closure of the commercial vehicle manufacturer LDV in 2009, once a part of the larger conglomerate British Leyland. The closure further reinforced the decline in UK automotive manufacturing until that point. The research involves the corporate collapse of LDV and the local government reaction to the closure and the following re-employment pathways of the redundant LDV workforce. The research continues the discussion of plant closures and the issues that redundant workers face when engaged in the labour market during economic recession. In particular, the thesis contribution employs a qualitative approach to examine the difficulties faced by the office tier, or ‘white collar’, workers who possess relatively high skills and who regarded as flexible and less vulnerable workers within the labour market. Yet this research exposes that highly skilled specialist workers are themselves also subject to unique issues when adjusting to the labour market. This topic is covered through the concept of worker trajectories: the research illustrates the unique employability issues and <b>job</b> <b>precariousness</b> that highly skilled workers can experience. The research concludes that the ability of highly skilled redundant workers to adapt effectively requires local job recovery strategies to implement short- and long-term policies with an emphasis on better job search and network development for individuals to sustain a resilient economy, and to mitigate the effects of plant closure upon redundant workers and maintain high skills within the region...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately 5 % of the {{population}} donates blood each year in developed countries. Recruiting and maintaining a pool of altruistic and healthy blood donors is a challenging task. Blood donation as a dynamic process must naturally co-exist with the arguably essential deferrals. Aims: To analyse a 11 -year cohort of donors and blood donations {{in order to determine}} the profile of the average donor and the typical donation. Characterize the donor’s population in terms of gender, age, number of donations, most common causes for deferral and exclusion and the possible relationships between them. Establish the tendency flow of donations per year. Methods: Analysis of 95861 blood donations from 31550 donors collected between 2000 and 2010 (11 years) in the Immunohemotherapy Department of the ‘‘Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Central - Hospital de Sa˜o Jose´’’ (Lisboa, Portugal). Prior to blood donation, donors were required to fill out a form of informed consent, a questionnaire of 21 ‘‘yes or no’’ questions and were submitted to a clinical assessment and physical examination including: measurement of weight, blood pressure, pulse and capillary hemoglobin levels. Post-donation, the collected blood was tested for ALT elevation and blood-borne viral agents (HBV, HCV, HIV 1 and 2 and HTLV 1 and 2) and other infections (Treponema pallidum). Blood donors and donations were registered in a database and statistically studied in terms of: gender and age distribution, number of donations, most common causes for deferral and exclusion. The frequency of blood donations throughout the period of observation was analyzed and statistically significant relationships between the collected variables were investigated. Results: From {{the population}} of 31550 donors 61 % were male and a mean age of 41. 5 years (± 12. 5 years) was found. From the total of 95682 blood donations collected 78 % were successful while the most common causes for deferral were: donation incompatible hemoglobin levels (5 % of the blood donations and 22 % of deferrals), ALT elevation (3 % and 14 %), positive blood screening test for Treponema pallidum (1 % and 6 %), medication (1 % and 4 %), positive serological blood markers for HBV (1 % and 4 %), endoscopy in the previous 12 months (1 % and 3 %), arterial hypertension (1 % and 3 %), infectious conditions (1 % and 3 %), influenza or influenza-like symptoms (1 % and 2 %) and positive serological blood markers for HCV (1 % and 2 %). Summary/Conclusions: Several factors may have contributed to a limited number of new regular donors in the population, namely: ageing population, the alienation of the individual from the community induced by modern lifestyles and <b>job</b> <b>precariousness.</b> It is of the utmost importance to refine our blood donation campaigns according to the existing population of donors. The optimization of the blood donation potential of a population of donors must be achieved through the development of reliable and consistent screening methods. In order to appeal to new donors it is important to promote blood donations considering the profile of the regular and healthy blood donor of the existing population...|$|E
