5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for <b>doing</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, when {{he knew he would}} be faced with being sent to the organization's prison-like program the Rehabilitation Project Force, Headley decided to leave. Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection. Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike {{by the side of the}} road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E

500|$|... "WOW" [...] is an {{industrial}} dance song, and Manson has {{described it as}} a turning point for the album, explaining: [...] "The first half of the record is kind of bitter and angry, but there's a confidence that starts to rebuild itself [...] I wanted to do a song that represented who I am, and why I started <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> the first place." [...] Manson plays a one-stringed guitar on the song, which also features the sound of him [...] "snorting lines of something - whatever it might have been - as a percussion instrument." [...] In a review of the leaked demo, which was originally titled [...] "The WoW", James Gill of Metal Hammer described it as [...] "genuinely filthy and intensely sexy. [...] It doesn't have anything in the way of memorable hooks, but it's the sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth strip club... if one existed." [...] "Wight Spider" [...] is one of the heaviest songs on the album, and has been compared to the work of Mastodon. Metal Hammer also said of the track: [...] "whether conscious or not, what [...] learned from Trent Reznor is back: the track builds and builds without changing direction." [...] "Unkillable Monster" [...] is a down-tempo rock song which alternates between a quiet-verse and loud-chorus structure, and features layered, distorted vocals and guitars.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen years later, in {{the first}} episode of the ninth series, Vaughn visits Lucas and leaves him with several mementos of his former life, {{including}} pictures of him and Maya. Lucas finds the hospital where she works to meet her. However, Maya coldy rejects him, stating she moved on with somebody else, and that she no longer needs him. By {{the end of the}} third episode however, Lucas invites her to his home and the two have sex on a kitchen table, thus restarting their relationship. However, over the course of the series, Vaughn has been manipulating Lucas, by giving him Maya back into his life, in order to get his hands on an MI5 file named [...] "Albany", which contain blueprints for a genetic weapon. To further force Lucas' hand in getting the file, Vaughn abducts Maya, though he was possibly <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> order to protect her from Chinese agents who wish to acquire Albany, and threatening to rape then behead Maya should Vaughn fail to deliver. Later, Lucas finds Maya after mortally wounding Vaughn. Having confessed his past crimes to his MI5 superior, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth), Lucas intends to flee the country with Maya, and agrees to give the Chinese Albany in exchange for money, and new identities for the couple. However, Maya is approached by hired specialist, Alec White (Vincent Regan), who tells her of Lucas's past crimes. By doing so, Maya turns against Lucas, and attempts to get him to surrender. However, when Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown) arrive, Lucas takes Maya to his car and evades them. When Beth and Demitri open fire, a bullet hits Maya in the torso, and she dies. Because a GPS tracker was placed on Maya, Lucas leaves her body behind.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{companies}} have been accused in court of using knowingly false announcements to gain market advantage.

The announcement resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} sales of CDC's product. The Justice Department accused IBM of doing this intentionally because the System/360 Model 91 was not released until three years later. IBM avoided preannouncing products during the antitrust case, but after the case ended it resumed the practice. The company likely announced its PCjr in November 1983—four months before general availability in March 1984—to hurt sales of rival home computers during the important Christmas sales season. The practice was not called [...] "vaporware" [...] at the time, but publications have since used the word to refer specifically to it. Similar cases have been filed against Kodak [...] film company, AT, and Xerox.|$|E
