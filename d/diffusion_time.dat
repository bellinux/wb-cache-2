25|$|A {{challenge}} {{most critical}} to analog IC design involves {{the variability of}} the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated BJT can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping gradients. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes {{to the amount of}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>time,</b> uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Diffusion MRI is {{frequently}} {{used to assess}} prostate cancer. The prostate consists of cellular tissue surrounding fluid filled ducts. Here, the diffusion properties of the ductal fluid alone were studied. Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate ductal residence times to determine whether ducts {{can be regarded as}} forming a separate compartment and whether ductal radius could determine the ADC of the ductal fluid. Methods: Random walks were simulated in cavities. Average residence times were estimated for permeable cavities. Signal reductions resulting from application of a Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence were calculated in impermeable cavities. Simulations were repeated for cavities of different radii and different <b>diffusion</b> <b>times.</b> Results: Residence times are at least comparable with <b>diffusion</b> <b>times</b> even in relatively high grade tumours. ADCs asymptotically approach theoretical limiting values. At large radii and short <b>diffusion</b> <b>times,</b> ADCs are similar to free diffusion. At small radii and long <b>diffusion</b> <b>times,</b> ADCs are reduced towards zero, and kurtosis approaches a value of - 1. 2. Conclusions: Restricted diffusion in cavities of similar sizes to prostate ducts may reduce ductal ADCs. This may contribute to reductions in total ADC seen in prostate cancer...|$|R

One of the interesting applications of this is {{an analysis of the}} concentration fluctuations of fluorescent particles (molecules) in solution. In this application, the fluorescence emitted from a very tiny space in solution containing a small number of fluorescent particles (molecules) is observed. The fluorescence intensity is fluctuating due to Brownian motion of the particles. In other words, the number of the particles in the sub-space defined by the optical system is randomly changing around the average number. The analysis gives the average number of fluorescent particles and average <b>diffusion</b> <b>time,</b> when the particle is passing through the space.

40|$|International audienceIntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is a {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) technique capable of measuring perfusion-related parameters. In this manuscript, we show that the mono-exponential model commonly used to process IVIM data might be challenged, especially at short <b>diffusion</b> <b>times.</b> Eleven rat datasets were acquired at 7 T using a diffusion-weighted pulsed gradient spin echo sequence with b-values ranging from 7 to 2500 [*]s/mm 2 at three <b>diffusion</b> <b>times.</b> The IVIM signals, obtained by removing the diffusion component from the raw MR signal, were fitted to the standard mono-exponential model, a bi-exponential model and the Kennan model.

50|$|Persistence length {{measurement}} of single stranded DNA is viable by various tools. Most {{of them have}} been done by incorporation of wormlike chain model. For example, two ends of single stranded DNA were tagged by Donor and acceptor dye to measure average end to end distance which is represented as FRET efficiency. The FRET efficiency were converted to persistence length by comparing the FRET efficiency with calculated FRET efficiency based on wormlike chain model. The recent attempts to obtain persistence length is combination of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) with HYDRO program. HYDRO program is simply noted as the upgrade of stoke's Einstein equation. The stoke's Einstein equation calculate diffusion coefficient (which is inversely proportional to <b>diffusion</b> <b>time)</b> by assuming the molecules as pure sphere. However, the HYDRO program has no limitation regarding to the shape of molecule. For estimation of single stranded DNA persistence length, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>time</b> of number of wormlike chain polymer was generated and its <b>diffusion</b> <b>time</b> is calculated by the HYDRO program which is compared with the experiment <b>diffusion</b> <b>time</b> of FCS.

To start a reaction in an enzyme, typically, an initially inactive substrate present in the crystal is activated. This has particular disadvantages that are circumvented when active substrate is directly provided by diffusion. However, then it is prohibitive to use macroscopic crystals because <b>diffusion</b> <b>times</b> become too long. With small micro- and nanocrystals <b>diffusion</b> <b>times</b> are adequately short for most enzymes and the reaction can be swiftly initiated.

50|$|In an imperfectly {{conducting}} fluid {{the magnetic}} field can generally move through the fluid following a diffusion law with the resistivity of the plasma serving as a diffusion constant. This means that solutions to the ideal MHD equations are only applicable for a limited time for a region of a given size before diffusion becomes too important to ignore. One can estimate the <b>diffusion</b> <b>time</b> across a solar active region (from collisional resistivity) to be hundreds to thousands of years, much longer than the actual lifetime of a sunspot—so it would seem reasonable to ignore the resistivity.

40|$|Measurements of {{apparent}} diffusion coefficient (ADC) using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) have been suggested as potential imaging biomarkers for monitoring tumor response to treatment. However, conventional pulsed-gradient spin echo (PGSE) methods incorporate relatively long <b>diffusion</b> <b>times,</b> and are usually sensitive to changes in cell density and necrosis. Diffusion temporal spectroscopy using the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence is capable of probing short length scales, and may detect significant intracellular microstructural changes independent of gross cell density changes following anti-cancer treatment. To test this hypothesis, SW 620 xenografts were treated by barasertib (AZD 1152), a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase which causes SW 620 cancer cells to develop polyploidy and increase in size following treatment, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis. Following treatment, the ADC values obtained by both the PGSE and low frequency OGSE methods increased. However, the ADC values at high gradient frequency (i. e. short <b>diffusion</b> <b>times)</b> were significantly lower in treated tumors, consistent with increased intracellular restrictions/hindrances. This suggests that ADC values at long <b>diffusion</b> <b>times</b> are dominated by tumor microstructure at long length scales, and may not convey unambiguous information of subcellular space. While the diffusion temporal spectroscopy provides more comprehensive means to probe tumor microstructure at various length scales. This work is the first study to prob...|$|R
