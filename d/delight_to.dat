5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Narrows Dam in 1951, a paved road was built to the structure from Murfreesboro, but was not initially designated a state highway. By 1953, the road had received the Highway19 designation it carries today. It {{is the fact that}} Highway26 formerly served as a northern terminus that possibly explains why Highway26, not Highway19, is the primary route from <b>Delight</b> <b>to</b> Murfreesboro despite being a lower number.|$|E
25|$|Another {{occasion}} to exercise his diplomatic ability soon arose. The British government suspected that warships had been outfitted {{in the port}} of Dubrovnik for the service of France, and that therefore the neutrality of the Republic of Ragusa had been violated. Bošković was selected to undertake an ambassadorship to London (1760), to vindicate the character of his native place and satisfy the government. This mission he discharged successfully – a credit to him and a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected {{a fellow of the}} Royal Society.|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> teach to move us to good; as if one should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E

25|$|After {{a disappointing}} 1983–84 season, which {{ended with a}} five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984–85 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and {{sometimes}} controversial ways. The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984–85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54–28 record and the second round of the 1986 playofs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.|$|E

500|$|Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell is a 1908 lyrical poem {{book written}} by Jean Louis De Esque. The {{publication}} includes a preface {{by the author}} with two poetic works, [...] "When I am Gone" [...] and [...] "Betelguese." [...] The latter poem {{has been called a}} [...] "classic" [...] work that utilized off-beat language, considered to be a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> the philologist. It has been compared to the poetic works of George Sterling and Kenneth Patchen.|$|E
500|$|George Orwell {{had a very}} {{negative}} view. [...] "This evil book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth reading in the original version. [...] It gives one {{some idea of the}} lengths to which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> bark and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging.".|$|E
500|$|Fey {{and former}} SNL castmate Amy Poehler {{starred in the}} 2008 comedy Baby Mama. The movie was written and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer. Baby Mama received mixed reviews, but critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: [...] "Fey is a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing." [...] The movie grossed over US$64million at the box office.|$|E

500|$|J.R. Ewing is {{a fictional}} {{character}} that William K.

[...] His New York Times colleague John J. O'Connor described him as [...] "the eldest son of the oil-rich Ewing family..." [...] who is [...] "...a sadistic bully and a swindler" [...] that [...] "captured the public's imagination". Season 3 left the viewer with numerous people to suspect for the murder.|$|E
500|$|Overall {{reception}} of Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon was also positive, though some reviewers felt {{that several of}} the tracks were of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} album. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described it as [...] "Awesome. Purely spectacular." [...] and Matt Brady of Final Fantasy Symphony concurred, saying that the [...] "music quality for this soundtrack was spectacular." [...] Daniel Space of RPGFan, however, found the quality mixed, and said that [...] "some of the pieces do not live up to the new orchestration," [...] although others [...] "were a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> hear." [...] He also found some of the instruments to be slightly out of tune, which he disliked, though Matt Brady felt it gave the pieces an [...] "ethnic feel".|$|E
500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E

500|$|Longfellow met Boston {{industrialist}} Nathan Appleton and {{his family}} {{in the town of}} Thun, Switzerland, including his son Thomas Gold Appleton. There he began courting Appleton's daughter Frances [...] "Fanny" [...] Appleton. The independent-minded Fanny was not interested in marriage, but Longfellow was determined. In July 1839, he wrote to a friend: [...] "Victory hangs doubtful. The lady says she will not! I say she shall! It is not pride, but the madness of passion". His friend George Stillman Hillard encouraged him in the pursuit: [...] "I <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> see you keeping up so stout a heart for the resolve to conquer is half the battle in love as well as war". During the courtship, Longfellow frequently walked from Cambridge to the Appleton home in Beacon Hill in Boston by crossing the Boston Bridge. That bridge was replaced in 1906 by a new bridge which was later renamed the Longfellow Bridge.|$|E
500|$|The gills are adnate (with gills broadly {{attached}} to the stem, slightly above {{the bottom of the}} gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) or slightly rounded next to the stem. The individual gills are close to subdistant, with between 10–14 reaching the stem, and two or three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem). The gills are moderately broad, pale orange to whitish, often yellowish at the base and whitish along the edges. The stem is [...] long, and up to 1mm thick; flexuous (winding from side to side), brittle, with the base covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The surface is densely white-pruinose initially, but soon becomes naked with a subsequent color shift to orange-yellow or lemon yellow. This species has been described as [...] "a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> behold", but [...] "one usually has to get down on hands and knees to find it!" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Ian McShane {{was asked about the}} process of shooting his final scene where he is shown hanging after being killed by the Brotherhood, with McShane saying that the filming of the scene was [...] "very easy.

[...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a <b>delight</b> <b>to</b> work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
