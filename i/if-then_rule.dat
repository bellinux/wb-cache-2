Keywords: fuzzy <b>IF-THEN</b> <b>rule</b> bases, relational interpretation, extensional interpretation, FATI, FITA 1 Introduction When interpreting Fuzzy IF-THEN rules one can look at one rule defining a fuzzy relation based on the left and right hand side of the rule. Given a fuzzy input set F 0 the evaluation of this input by a fuzzy rule can be interpreted as the fuzzy image of F 0 under this relation. When interpreting rule bases, there are two principles to perform the above interpretation on more than one rule. The property, whether the relation solves a particular equation system or not, together with the two principles leads to a combination of four alternatives which are now investigated. 2 The Pri [...] ...|$|E

Each fuzzy <b>if-then</b> <b>rule</b> in our classification system has antecedent linguistic values and a single consequent class.

The winner rule for a new pattern is the fuzzy <b>if-then</b> <b>rule</b> that has the maximum compatibility grade with the new pattern. When we use fuzzy if-then rules with certainty grades (i. e., rule weights), the winner is determined as the rule with the maximum product of the compatibility grade and the certainty grade. In this paper, the effect of rule weights is illustrated by drawing classification boundaries using fuzzy if-then rules with/without certainty grades. It is also shown that certainty grades {{play an important role}} when a fuzzy rule-based classification system is a mixture of general rules and specific rules.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{performance}} of a fuzzy genetics-based machine learning method for multidimensional pattern classification problems with continuous attributes. In our method, each fuzzy <b>if–then</b> <b>rule</b> is handled as an individual, and a fitness value is assigned to each rule. Thus, our method {{can be viewed as a}} classifier system. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy if–then rules and fuzzy reasoning for pattern classification problems. Then we explain a genetics-based machine learning method that automatically generates fuzzy if–then rules for pattern classification problems from numerical data. Because our method uses linguistic values with fixed membership functions as antecedent fuzzy sets, a linguistic interpretation of each fuzzy <b>if–then</b> <b>rule</b> is easily obtained. The fixed membership functions also lead to a simple implementation of our method as a computer program. The simplicity of implementation and the linguistic interpretation of the generated fuzzy if–then rules are the main characteristic features of our method. The performance of our method is evaluated by computer simulations on some well-known test problems. While our method involves no tuning mechanism of membership functions, it works very well in comparison with other classification methods such as nonfuzzy machine learning techniques and neural networks...|$|E
