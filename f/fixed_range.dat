2500|$|Some {{properties}} of the Rössler system can be deduced via linear methods such as eigenvectors, but the main features of the system require non-linear methods such as Poincaré maps and bifurcation diagrams. The original Rössler paper states the Rössler attractor was intended to behave similarly to the Lorenz attractor, but also be easier to analyze qualitatively. An orbit within the attractor follows an outward spiral close to the [...] plane around an unstable fixed point. Once the graph spirals out enough, a second fixed point influences the graph, causing a rise and twist in the -dimension. In the time domain, it becomes apparent that although each variable is oscillating within a <b>fixed</b> <b>range</b> of values, the oscillations are chaotic. This attractor has some similarities to the Lorenz attractor, but is simpler and has only one manifold. Otto Rössler designed the Rössler attractor in 1976, but the originally theoretical equations were later found to be useful in modeling equilibrium in chemical reactions.|$|E

Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12bits for luminance and 8bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.|$|R

30|$|However, {{instead of}} two fixed values, impulse noise can be more realistically modeled by two <b>fixed</b> <b>ranges</b> that appear at both ends [10 – 12]. In [10], the Boundary Discriminative Noise Detection (BDND) is {{proposed}} to classify the pixels according to their intensities. The image restoration is done by using the switching median filter. A Noise Fading Technique (NFT), presented in [11], first applies an impulse detector and then employs a pixel restoring median filter for denoising the corrupted pixels in an iterative manner. In [12], a Two-State Switching Median filter (TSSM) is proposed which uses a noise intensity identification scheme to detect the corrupted pixels. The filtering scheme is chosen from two different switching median filters.|$|R

When an enemy is defeated with a close-range attack, the amount of points awarded will be doubled. The player can also attack the enemy with a jumping attack depending on the timing. The player can also throw an explosive (which serves as the character's sub-weapon) by pressing the shoot and jump buttons simultaneously while standing or crouching. The type of explosive used by the player varies depending on the character. The player can use explosives to take down several enemies in a <b>fixed</b> <b>range,</b> allowing players to accumulate more points than by killing them with simple gunfire.|$|E
