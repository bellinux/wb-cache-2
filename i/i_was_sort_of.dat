Goldsmith later remarked that [...] "you can see that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers." [...] Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as [...] "full of dark beauty" [...] and [...] "seriously threatening, but beautiful." [...] It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. The score has been released as a soundtrack album in several versions with different tracks and sequences.|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Radiohead toured {{in support}} of their second album The Bends. Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hoping I would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, but he later said [...] "Lucky" [...] shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: [...] "'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall." ...|$|E

500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I said, I would love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted self-mockery towards [...] "her own idyllic disposition" [...] in the lyrics [...] "I thought I could {{organize}} freedom/How Scandinavian of me!" [...] That line {{was covered in}} various reviews; it {{has been described as}} [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "derisively" [...] delivered. When asked about the meaning of those lines, Björk replied: [...] "in Iceland, the people from Sweden, we think they're really not cool at all and they just have got no sense of humour, are really organized. And you can't organize everything. So I think in that song, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of...</b> thinking that I could even organize freedom, just like very stupid. Quite Swedish, you know." [...] Some critics have also identified the lyrics as a hint to a failed relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Fox {{has spoken}} {{extensively}} {{of her time}} in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being [...] "pelted with ketchup packets". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had [...] "always gotten along better with boys" [...] and that [...] "rubbed some people the wrong way". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that [...] "everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn’t like me for that. I’ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has [...] "never been {{a big believer in}} formal education" [...] and that [...] "the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> checked out on that part of it".|$|E

He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E
