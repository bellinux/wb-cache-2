40|$|Abstract. Orthodontic tooth {{movement}} {{is achieved by}} the remodeling of alveolar bone in response to mechanical loading by using spring coil. Spring coil design was made of round stainless steel wire and usually it was custom-made design. In the previous study, the orthodontic force on 30 gram is required to move maxillary incisor during experimental tooth movement in rat. In this study, optimization new design of spring coil is developed to fulfill the requirement of orthodontic force. The design variable of new spring coil design is set on variation of angle aperture (5 o ≤ α ≤ 10 o), hook length (10 mm ≤ l ≤ 20 mm) and hook diameter (0. 012 inch ≤ D ≤ 0. 014 inch). From the result, it can be produced the optimum designs which 8. 9 o of angle aperture; 12 mm of hook length and 0. 014 inch of hook diameter for fulfilling the requirement of orthodontic force on 30 <b>gram</b> <b>force...</b>|$|E
40|$|Adhesion {{strength}} and surface morphology of commonly used n- and p-type ohmic contacts and pad metallization schemes for GaAs were investigated. GeNiAu, GePdAu, BeAu, and TiPtAu (being studied as potential ohmic contacts for internal optoelectronic devices) had quantitiative measurements made using wire bond pull testing to determine adhesion. Bond pad metals deposited as evaporated TiAu, TiPtAu, and 2 - 5 micron thick electroplated Au deposited on both semi-insulating GaAs and on Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }/GaAs were evaluated independently from the ohmic contact metals. In all samples was observed {{a strong correlation}} between surface treatment, surface morphology, wire bondability, and bond strength. Very high bond strengths (pull test average values above 6. 5 grams force with 25 micron dia Au wire) wereobtained for n-type, p-type, and bond pad metals. Average values of 8. 0 <b>gram</b> <b>force</b> were achieved with two-step GeAu/NiAu/TiPtAu metallization, while one-step deposition yielded poorer values.

An optimum electrode gap and chamber diameter were determined for a stagnation pressure between 1 and 1. 5 atmospheres by computing {{the efficiency of the}} unit for various values of these parameters. Two methods of increasing the specific impulse of the test gas at sonic velocity were studied using optimum chamber conditions. First, the energy input to the gas was increased to approximately 1. 5 X 105 cal/gram for hydrogen; and a maximum specific impulse of 2300 <b>grams</b> <b>force</b> over <b>grams</b> mass/sec was obtained. Further increases in the specific impulse resulted from removal of boundary layer gas at the throat.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and inexpensive penetrometer is described, {{consisting of a}} mounted rod and polished steel ball that may be advanced downward at variable speed through meat slices mounted on a plexiglass cylinder. The slice + mounting cylinder was placed on a top-loading balance, tared to zero, and centered under the penetrometer rod. Bind strength was measured as the peak force (g) required for the steel ball advancing at 2. 0 cm/min to penetrate the meat slice. Data points (<b>grams</b> <b>force</b> versus time) were collected and plotted using an IBM-compatible personal computer and printer. Since the balance collected gram values continuously, a QuickBasic program was developed, allowing the user to specify the time interval (1, 2, 5 s, etc.) between recorded values. Bind strength of turkey rolls was increased by finely chopping the emulsion (vs. coarsely-ground samples), and by inclusion of 3 % nonfat dry milk.

40|$|It {{was made}} the {{characterization}} of marginal sphincter to the species Phymactis clematis (Drayton in Dana, 1849) and Aulactinia marplatensis (Zamponi, 1977), from intertidal ecosystem through their morphogical and functional study. The species P. clematis has a circumscript sphincter of palmate type. This muscle is constituted by a mesogloeal axis and several mesogloeal subaxes. Axis as well as subaxes give a support to the endoderm which border is smooth. Aulactinia marplatensis has a circunscript sphincter pinnate type. The axis has a truncated cone shape while in P. clematis the shape is cylindrical on its origin and it is bifurcated at the end. Both species experiments were carried out using the isolated muscles. They were stimulated at increasing KCl concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 mM. The results were analysed {{in the form of}} dose-response curves expressed in tension in <b>grams</b> <b>force</b> vs concentration.

40|$|Two {{types of}} dorsal root {{potential}} (DRP) {{were found in}} the spinal cord of urethane-anaesthetized rats. Local DRPs with short latency-to-onset were evoked on roots close to the point of entry of an afferent volley. Diffuse DRPs with a longer latency-to-onset were seen on more distant roots up to 17 segments from the volley entry zone. The switch to long latency-to-onset occurred abruptly as a function of distance along the cord and could not be explained by conduction delays within the dorsal columns. Long-latency DRPs were also present and superimposed on the short-latency DRPs on nearby roots. Both local and diffuse DRPs were evoked by light mechanical stimuli: von Frey hair thresholds were ≤ 1 <b>gram</b> <b>force</b> Changes in excitability of the terminals of sural nerve afferents were used to confirm that both local and diffuse DRPs were associated with primary afferent depolarization (PAD). These effects were potent: the area of the antidromic volley evoked in the sural nerve by intraspinal microstimulation in the L 4 / 5 spinal segment was increased by 109 ± 50 % (mean ± s. d.; n = 5) by nearby conditioning stimuli, and by 52 ± 12 % (n = 6) with stimuli applied 9 – 13 mm (5 – 8 segments) away. The time course of the changes in terminal excitability closely matched those of the DRPs. Reduction of the field potentials evoked in the dorsal horn by stimulation of dorsal roots was also shown to accompany both local and diffuse DRPs. The area of the monosynaptically evoked field potential was reduced by 48 ± 19 % (n = 7) with nearby conditioning stimulation and 16 ± 9 % (n = 10) with stimulation 9 – 12 mm distant. Evidence is presented that this inhibition includes a presynaptic component. Similar effects were seen with field potentials evoked by sural nerve stimulation. It is concluded that diffuse DRPs are mediated through propriospinal networks which may contribute to the gating of sensory information flow during natural behaviour as they respond to weak mechanical stimuli and provoke presynaptic inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Craniosacral {{therapy is}} used to treat {{conditions}} ranging from headache pain and temporomandibular dysfunction to developmental disabilities. It is based, in part, on the biological premise that physical manipulation of the meninges through the cranial vault sutures {{with low levels of}} force (~ 5 gms) alters the rhythmic fluctuation of cerebrospinal fluid and intracranial pressure (ICP). The present study was designed to test this hypothesis by simulating a craniosacral "frontal lift" technique and measuring cranial bone movement at the coronal suture and resultant ICP changes in a rabbit model. Methods: Thirteen adult New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were anesthetized {{for the duration of the}} study and 1. 2 mm "Y" microplates were fixed to the frontal and parietal bones on either side of the coronal suture using 4 mm long screws. The ends of the plates were secured to a base plate caudally and to an Instrom load cell rostrally. Continuous epidural ICP measurements were made using a NeuroMonitor transducer positioned through a burr hole in the parietal bone. Distractive loads of 5, 10, 15, and 20 grams were applied sequentially at a rate of 0. 5 mm/minute to the coronal suture. Baseline and distraction radiographs and ICP were obtained. One subject underwent additional distractive force loads of 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10, 000 grams. Plate separation was measured using a digital caliper from the radiographs. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess significant differences in ICP and suture movement. Results: No significant differences were noted between baseline and distraction suture separation (F= 0. 045; p> 0. 05) and between baseline and distraction ICP (F= 0. 279; p> 0. 05) at any load. No significant (p> 0. 05) correlations were noted among distractive load, plate movement, and ICP. In the single subject that underwent additional, higher distractive forces, movement across the coronal suture was not seen until the 10, 000 <b>gram</b> <b>force</b> which produced 0. 91 mm of separation but no ICP changes. Conclusion: Low loads of force, similar to those used clinically when performing a craniosacral "frontal lift" technique, resulted in no significant changes in coronal suture movement or ICP in rabbits. These results suggest a different biological basis for Craniosacral Therapy should be explored...|$|E

Responses were compared {{in the same}} animals among airway Generations 2 - 5. Concentration-response curves were generated in the same strips with methacholine (MCh) and potassium chloride (KCl) in vitro. Force of contraction was assessed as <b>grams</b> <b>force</b> (g) divided by tissue wet weight (g/g) and was normalized further for the proportion of smooth muscle in each airway by means of computerized morphometry (g/g smooth muscle mass; g/gM). Both techniques revealed substantial heterogeneity of response that was not dependent upon the mechanism of contraction. Maximal isometric contraction to MCh increased from 1911 +/- 245 (Generation 2) to 6693 +/- 850 g/gM (Generation 5) (P less than 0. 005). Similarly, maximal contraction to KCl, an agonist causing contraction by a non-receptor-mediated mechanism, was nearly three times greater in Generation 5 than in Generation 2 bronchi (P less than 0. 005). It is concluded that the force of isometric contraction of bronchial smooth muscle increases through the first five generations of bronchi, even after normalization for smooth muscle mass.

The initial Vickers microhardness was measured (load of 50 <b>grams</b> <b>force</b> for 30 seconds) on the top surface of the test specimens. The groups were treated and divided as follows: G 1 - artificial saliva (21 days - control); G 2 - 7 % hydrogen peroxide gel applied for 4 h/day, for 14 days; G 3 - 10 % carbamide peroxide for 4 h/day, for 14 days: G 4 - 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel applied in three sessions of 30 minutes each, with an interval of one week (21 days) between the sessions; G 5 - 35 % carbamide peroxide, three sessions of 30 minutes each, with an interval of one week (21 days) between the sessions.

5000|$|Von Frey {{filaments}} rely on {{the principle}} that an elastic column, in compression, will buckle elastically at a specific force, dependent on the length, diameter and modulus of the material. Once buckled, the force imparted by the column is fairly constant, irrespective of the degree of buckling. The filaments may therefore be used to provide a range of forces to the skin of a test subject, in order to find the force at which the subject reacts because the sensation is painful. This type of test is called a mechanical nociceptive threshold test.The buckling force is inversely proportional to the length of the column (so the shorter the column, the higher the force required to buckle it) and proportional to the cube of the diameter, so that increasing the diameter of a filament by a small amount increases the buckling force considerably. Sets of filaments are normally made of nylon hairs, all the same length, but of various diameters so as to provide a range of forces, typically from 0.008 <b>grams</b> <b>force</b> up to 300 grams force.Von Frey filaments are a diagnostic, research, and screening tool, used both in human and animal medicine. They are readily used to study skin areas with normal responsiveness, as well as hyper- or hyposensitive areas.The determination of a mechanical threshold using von Frey filaments requires a number of discrete tests using filaments with different bucking forces. There are two commonly used algorithms, the up-down method and the percent response method. The up-down method is most commonly used, usually requiring a minimum of four tests after the first response is detected. The first measurement should be made with a filament with a buckling force close to the expected mean of the population. Errors may result if testing is commenced a long way above or below the mean. These errors have been evaluated by a combination of experimentation and mathematical simulation ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to measure the pain {{threshold}} in hypertensive patients with a new auto-algometry method. Auto-algometry consists of asking the subjects to push their fingers against a fixed round-tip needle until they feel a pain sensation. An electronic force transducer permits the measurement of the force applied by the subjects and storage of the data on a personal computer. Eight tests are performed twice on each subject on the tip and back of four fingers. For each test, the maximal applied <b>force</b> (<b>grams)</b> is defined as pain threshold. The overall discomfort during the entire procedure is reported by the subjects on a 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (intolerable pain) scale. A group of hypertensive patients (n = 22) {{and a group of}} normotensive subjects (n = 22) underwent the auto-algometry examination. The pain threshold was higher in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects. All discomfort scores referred by the subjects fell within the 4 - 6 range. The data obtained from this study indicate that the auto-algometer as described here can detect hypoalgesia associated with hypertension...|$|R

40|$|The teeth {{will move}} if {{subjected}} into pressure from orthodontic appliances which causes a remodeling of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. MMP- 8 {{plays an important}} role in the remodeling process during orthodontic movement. The expression of MMP- 8 gene is regulated by a natural inhibitor namely TIMP- 1. The purpose of this study was to observe the MMP- 8 and TIMP- 1 gene expressions in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with removable orthodontic appliance. A sample of 8 patients wearing removable orthodontic appliances was obtained. The finger springs were activated with 75 <b>grams</b> of <b>force</b> to produce canine distalization. GCF samples were collected from the distal side of upper canines before force application, 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 4 weeks after application consecutively. The samples were analyzed by using RT-PCR. Statistical univariate analysis was used to show the distribution and percentages of the gene expressions. The gene expression of MMP- 8 at t 0 was 28. 1 % but the force application elevated its expression to 62. 5 % at t 1, and then decreased continously at t 2 (37. 5 %), t 3 (34. 4 %), and t 4 (31, 3 %). The gene expression of TIMP- 1 at t 0 was 40, 6 % but the force application elevated its expression to 59, 4 % at t 1, and then decreased continously at t 2 (43, 8 %), t 3 (40, 6 %), and t 4 (37, 5 %). In conclusion, there was a dynamic gene expressions of MMP- 8 and TIMP- 1 before and after force application and the pattern was similar, i. e. the highest level was happened on the first week, but it declined continously in the following weeks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{establish}} a three-dimension {{finite element model}} for orthodontic anchorage micro-implant and analyze the influence of different titled angle on the biomechanical characteristics of orthodontic anchorage implant-bone interface. Methods: Use ANSYS (Analysis System) finite element analysis software to perform the finite element modeling of the micro-implant with 7 different tilted angle, including 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 70 °, 80 °and 90 °. A simulated orthodontic force, which was 200 grams, was loaded mesiodistally to the mathematical models, the stress and displacement distribution on the implant-bone interface was analyzed. Results: As the titled angle increased, the Von-Mises stress at the cervix of the implants were 1. 0792 Mpa, 1. 0104 Mpa, 0. 8848 Mpa, 0. 8181 Mpa, 0. 7583 Mpa, 0. 6339 Mpa and 0. 5608 Mpa while the displacement were 5. 5513 µm, 4. 9900 µm, 3. 7419 µm, 3. 1264 µm, 2. 5874 µm, 1. 3624 µm and 0. 8027 µm. Conclusion: The micro-implant can be safely loaded with 200 <b>grams</b> mesiodistal orthodontic <b>force.</b> The increase of the titled angle can efficaciously enhance the implant’s ability of bearing mesiodistal orthodontic force. Thus we should choose the vertical angle when the micro-implant is embedded...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to clarify the {{biomechanics}} of en-masse retraction of the upper anterior teeth and attempt to quantify the different forces and moments generated using mini-implants and to calculate the amount of applied force optimal for en-masse intrusion and retraction using mini-implants. Methods: The optimum force required for en-masse intrusion and retraction can be calculated by using simple mathematical formulae. Depending on the position of the mini-implant and the relationship of the attachment to the center of resistance of the anterior segment, different clinical outcomes are encountered. Using certain mathematical formulae, accurate measurements of the magnitude of force and moment generated on the teeth can be calculated for each clinical outcome. Results: Optimum force for en-masse intrusion and retraction of maxillary anterior teeth is 212 <b>grams</b> per side. <b>Force</b> applied at an angle of 5 o to 16 o from the occlusal plane produce intrusive and retraction force components that are within the physiologic limit. Conclusion: Different clinical outcomes are encountered depending on the position of the mini-implant and the length of the attachment. It is possible to calculate the forces and moments generated for any given magnitude of applied force. The orthodontist can apply the basic biomechanical principles mentioned in this study to calculate the forces and moments for different hypothetical clinical scenarios...|$|R
40|$|As a {{minimally}} invasive means of extracting a tissue sample from a patient, current endoscopic biopsy needles {{generally do not}} preserve tissue histology and often require multiple attempts to obtain a tissue sample. This paper presents an endoscopic biopsy needle with internal flexures that enable tissue to enter the hollow needle and then be severed from surrounding tissue when the needle is withdrawn. Using force-deflection and sample weight data from 10 x scaled prototypes, variations of a flexural design captured 1. 1 grams of a tissue phantom on average, as compared to wedge-type designs that averaged of 0. 7 - 0. 8 <b>grams.</b> Peak entrance <b>forces</b> for the flexure design were lower than for both wedge and extended wedge designs, and resistance forces were higher upon needle extraction. A low-angle 15 -degree feature produced lower entrance resistance and larger exit resistance compared with 30 degree, 45 degree, and 60 degree features, which is desirable when retaining tissue. Manufacturing of a 1 x scale prototypes, using a grinding and laser cutting process, suggested that flexural features could be produced in current endoscopic biopsy needles, but changes to the beveled cutting tip would first {{have to be made}} before flexural elements could be tested on actual liver samples. by Stacy L.

40|$|Orthodontic {{expansion}} {{has been}} associated with uncontrolled tipping and alveolar bone loss. Recent research evaluating orthodontic expansion has shown osteoblastic activity on the buccal cortical bone apical to the dehiscence. We hypothesize that the negative effects seen during orthodontic expansion is a result of tipping rather than expansion. The aim {{of the present study was}} to produce buccal translation, with little or no coronal tipping, and evaluate hard tissue changes of the dental-alveolar complex. A prospective, randomized, split-mouth study was conducted with 11 patients (average age 14. 1 years, range 12. 5 - 16. 9 years) requiring maxillary first premolar extractions for comprehensive orthodontic treatment. Pre and post-treatment records included models, photographs, and small field of view cone beam computed tomographic images (FOV CBCT) of the right and left maxillae. One maxillary first premolar was randomly chosen and moved to the buccal with 50 <b>grams</b> of <b>force</b> applied approximately at the tooth?s center of resistance. The other premolar served as the control tooth. Forces were re-activated every 3 weeks for approximately 9 weeks of active movement, after which the tooth was held in place for 3 weeks to allow for maturation of the surrounding tissue. Pre and post treatment records were analyzed and superimposed to evaluate changes in the dental-alveolar complex. The results showed significant movement (0. 96 mm, p= 0. 008) of the experimental premolar occurred 3 mm apical to the CEJ. There was minimal buccal tipping (2. 2 ?, p= 0. 003). Maximum and minimum buccal bone heights decreased 0. 60 mm (p= 0. 003) and 0. 25 mm (p= 0. 262) respectively. The distribution of the maximum bone height measurement was bimodal, with 6 patients showing 0. 42 mm (IQR - 0. 25 mm to 0. 52 mm) and 5 patients showing 8. 3 mm (IQR 7. 15 to 10. 05) of vertical bone loss. Buccal bone thickness at the midline 3 mm apical to the CEJ decreased 0. 63 mm (p= 0. 016). Based on direct measurements and CBCT superimpositions, buccal bone grew 0. 46 mm (p= 0. 005) and 0. 51 mm (p= 0. 036), respectively. Using light continuous forces, it is possible to produce buccal tooth movement with only limited amounts of tipping. With such movements buccal bone growth occurs, but there are potential limitations...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Corticotomy-facilitated {{orthodontics}} {{provides a}} means for rapidly moving teeth purportedly with little damaging effects to the periodontium and with greatly reduced treatment time. The {{aim of this study}} was to enhance the orthodontic tooth movement by reducing the cortical bone layer (resistant to bone re-sorption relative to spongious bone) following Erbium, Chromium doped Yttrium Scandium Gallium Garnet (Er-Cr: YSGG) laser irradiation, without reflection of surgical soft tissue flap. METHODS: In the present experimental study, 8 New Zealand Male rabbits were the samples for the research. The right first premolar of each rabbit (experiment group) underwent treatment for mesial movement with 75 <b>gram</b> of orthodontic <b>force</b> by using closed Ni-Ti coil spring (Dentaurum®). Coil spring was fixed in the cervical region of first premolars by means of ligature wire and No-Mix composite (Dentaurum®) and also activated to the cervical site of incisors. The left first premolars of the subjects were considered as the control group. Laser corticotomy was performed in anesthetized rabbits. Samples were sacrificed for determination of tooth movement after initiating premolar protraction on the 21 th day. The amount of orthodontic tooth movement was assessed by using a metal feeler gauge with the precision of 0. 01 mm, between mesial surface of the second premolars and distal surfaces of the first premolars. The statistical package of SPSS (Kolmogorov - Smirnov and ANOVA test) was used for analytical evaluation of the measurements. RESULTS: The amount of orthodontic tooth movement in the experimental group (mean= 1. 653 ± 0. 34 mm) was significantly (p CONCLUSION: The innovated method of laser assisted flapless corticotomy is a useful procedure for reducing treatment time and damage to periodontium. It also eliminates the necessity of more invasive intervention of flap surgery. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundVasopressin {{may be a}} {{potential}} cause of spasm in both the radial artery and the internal thoracic artery. This study compared the vasopressin-induced contraction {{and the effects of}} milrinone, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside in vasopressin-induced contraction between the human radial artery and the internal thoracic artery to find effective antispastic methods for arterial grafts. MethodsConcentration-contraction (normalized as <b>force</b> <b>gram</b> produced by each millimeter of the circumference tissue of the artery) curves for vasopressin with or without pretreatment of vasodilators and concentration-relaxation curves for the vasodilators listed were established in the human radial artery (n = 107) and internal thoracic artery (n = 122) segments. ResultsVasopressin induced a greater contraction in the radial artery than in the internal thoracic artery (1. 9 ± 0. 2 g/mm vs 0. 6 ± 0. 1 g/mm, P <. 001) with a higher sensitivity (lower EC 50 : − 9. 28 ± 0. 11 vs − 8. 91 ± 0. 05 log 10 M, P =. 006). Milrinone was less potent than nitroglycerin and nitroprusside with higher EC 50 (P <. 05) in both the internal thoracic artery and radial artery. Pretreatment with milrinone and nitroprusside significantly inhibited vasopressin contraction in the internal thoracic artery but had little effect in the radial artery. Pretreatment with nitroglycerin did not significantly inhibit the maximum vasopressin contraction in either the internal thoracic artery or radial artery. ConclusionThe radial artery is more prone to develop spasm related to vasopressin than is the internal thoracic artery, and the effect of vasodilators in vasopressin-induced contraction is different in the radial artery from that in the internal thoracic artery. A more significant prophylactic antispastic effect of milrinone and nitroprusside is demonstrated in the internal thoracic artery than in the radial artery. Therefore, more intensive antispastic treatment is necessary in the radial artery than in the internal thoracic artery during coronary artery bypass grafting...|$|R
