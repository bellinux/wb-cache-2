40|$|The <b>e-cohesion</b> is {{according}} to European Commission (EC) {{a set of}} common rules for simplifying the accountancy and more precise reporting for European structural funds and European investment funds by using the digital technologies and public databases for all exchanges of information between the beneficiaries of projects financed with European funds and audit authorities, intermediate bodies, certifying authorities, managing authorities. The budget allocated for investments of the European Union (EU) for period 2014 - 2020 is of approximately a trillion Euros for sustainable growth, new jobs and competitiveness, solidarity and cohesion for an important role of EU in world. One of the ten points of reforms related with the cohesion politics refers to <b>e-cohesion.</b> The article outline the EU and Romania regulations prepared for <b>e-cohesion</b> target that is established for all EU countries in 2016. The paper is presenting the main opportunities and limits in the <b>e-cohesion</b> process for the horizon 2014 - 2020 using as methodology of study the computing and analysis based on the documentation published by EU, Netherlands and Romanian regulators. The study is also presenting the stage of <b>e-cohesion</b> changes reported by Netherlands and Romania...|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} development of Romania in 2014 - 2020 should {{rely on the}} {{lessons learned from the}} 2007 - 2013 period. In this wider context, the paper analyses the effects of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) provided within the 2007 - 2013 programme focusing {{on the development of the}} economic competitiveness, on the large enterprises from the North-East region of Romania. Three hypotheses are tested within this empirical research. First, that the EU financial assistance granted to a large enterprise implies an increase in its net turnover, gross profit and number of staff. Second, we aim to see whether the increase in the net turnover, gross profit and number of staff is directly linked to the increase of the ERDF grant. Finally, we analyse if the increase of the three indicators is higher for the large enterprises that implemented more projects than for the enterprises that implemented a single project. The analysis also puts under discussion the quality and the availability of the information concerning the projects funded by the European Union in Romania, taking also into consideration the 2014 - 2020 <b>e-cohesion</b> requirement...|$|E
40|$|As {{the first}} {{programming}} period for Romania is reaching its end, more information becomes available regarding {{the effects of}} the European Union funds on the Romanian economy. Going beyond the mathematical absorption rate, it is important to analyse these effects, especially with regard to the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to improve the future implementation documents for 2014 - 2020. The {{purpose of this article is}} to measure the impact of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), granted within one of the 2007 - 2013 operational programmes, on the net turnover, number of staff and gross profit of the small and medium-sized enterprises from one Romanian county â€“ Iasi. Overcoming the difficulties of gathering reliable data, the empirical research presented in this article tests three hypotheses. The first one is that the EU funding provided to an SME leads to an increase in its net turnover, number of staff and gross profit. The second hypothesis is that there is a direct relationship between the amount of the grant given to an SME and the evolution of the three previously mentioned parameters. The third and last tested hypothesis is that the SMEs that implemented more than one EU-funded project have a better evolution than the ones that implemented only one. The conclusions of our study include recommendations for the implementation guides that are currently being drafted by the responsible national authorities. They also include suggestions with regard to the availability of data concerning the EU-funded projects, especially in the context of the new requirements of the European Union regarding <b>e-cohesion</b> and information and communication. In this context, we also explore the potential benefits of implementing projects that complement each other instead of independent projects. As such, the research presented in this article aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the EU regional development policy and to the improvement of the legislative and procedural framework of its implementation...|$|E
