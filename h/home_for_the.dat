40|$|A {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is "Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly {{in the city}} compared with the village". A theoretical part of the bachelor thesis {{is divided into three}} circuits, in the first one there are explained conceptions of an old age, ageing process and changes associated with it. The second circuit is devoted to a leisure time of the elderly and an introduction of possible activities. Last, but not least, there is mentioned a social work with seniors. A practical part is focused on achieving the defined objectives. The fist goal was to compare leisure activities in chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities and villages {{with the help of a}} secondary data analysis. Activity plans and their websites underwent the secondary data analysis in <b>the</b> chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. The second goal was to find out seniors´ satisfaction with provided leisure time activities. The satisfaction was measured through a questionnaire. The research showed that the seniors are satisfied with the leisure activities in all the chosen homes both in the cities and in the villages. Following hypotheses were established before an implementation of the research: Hypothesis No. 1 : Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities are comparable with leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the villages. This hypothesis was confirmed by the research. In all selected <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly there is an emphasis on leisure activities, all <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly hold similar (comparable) leisure activities for their clients. Hypothesis No. 2 : There are no differences between an organization of leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in cities and villages, was not confirmed. The secondary analysis revealed that <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the cities have more employees engaged in the leisure activities. Therefore they can devote more attention to immobile clients. Additionally there still come volunteers to those homes, who individually attend to the single clients of the homes. The thesis can be used by both by professionals and the general public to obtain information about leisure activities in <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly in the cities and villages and a possibility to assess any differences in an offer of the leisure time activities...|$|R

40|$|The ageing of {{the populations}} of {{developed}} societies {{represents one of the}} biggest economic and social challenges of the future. According to the predictions 30 % of the population in Slovenia will be older than 65 years by the year 2060. This raises the questions of how to define the lifestyle of the elderly, and how can the latter influence be influenced. The decision of some elderly people to spend their old age in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly can be contributed to a multitude of reasons. The paper presents the results of the research on the lifestyle of <b>the</b> elderly in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the alterations of physical properties of elderly persons in Special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged. The body weight and body mass index(BMI) were measured. Body fat percentage was also obtained by using infrared interactance method. These parameters were measured {{at the time of the}} subjects admittance to the facility and during a period of eight months stay in the facility. The results obtained are as follows. BMI and body fat percentage of elderly women who have just been institutionalized in <b>the</b> special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged were significantly lower than those of the elderly women who have recieved day-care service. Body fat percentage significantly increased after entering the facility, however, both BMI and body weight remained unchanged during the eight months. Lower-body-fat-percentage-elderly were two out of ten, however, those were increased to the normal range at the time of one month after entering in the facility. A definite correlation was obtained between body fat percentage and BMI in elderly who were given day-care service, but the correlation was not obtained between BMI and body fat percentage in elderly who were recently institutionalized in special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged. These results showed that insufficient nutritional intake at their homes might be improved upon at <b>the</b> special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged, and pointed out that special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged had an improving effect on diets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Persons of high-body-fat-percentage with low or normal BMI gradually increased after they entered <b>the</b> special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Moreover, energy expenditure resulting from exercise in special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged was 0. 5 - 32. 5 Kcal/day. A negative correlation was obtained between body fat percentage and energy expenditure due to exercise. It is suggested that a cause of the increase in persons with a high-body-fat-percentage and low or normal BMI may be related to low energy expenditure due to exercise programs in special nursing <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aged...|$|R
