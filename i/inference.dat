This study was designed to investigate the quantity and variety of <b>inferences</b> made by eighth grade males and females who read two long, narrative prose selections. <b>Inferences</b> were assessed through oral recall and through oral introspection. Sixteen male and sixteen female eighth grade students of average IQ and reading ability were randomly selected and placed into the eight cells of the experimental design: 2 (sex) x 2 (passage) x 2 (assessment condition). Two narratives of similar length, readability, and general interest served as materials. Each passage was divided into four sections. Subjects worked individually with the investigator. After a general introduction, subjects practiced assigned procedures with a "warm-up" passage. The experimental passage was then read in one-section segments, with recall or introspection after each section had been read. Sessions were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions were analyzed to determine the number and types of <b>inferences</b> they contained. A taxonomy of <b>inferences</b> proposed by Warren, Nicholas, and Trabasso (1979) was adapted for categorizing <b>inferences</b> by type. Implausible <b>inferences</b> received partial credit. Score reliability was high. A three-way factorial analysis of variance was used to test hypotheses related to the quantity of <b>inferences</b> generated. Three chi-square tests were used to test hypotheses related to the variety of <b>inferences</b> generated. No statistically significant differences were found in the number of <b>inferences</b> made by males and females, the number of <b>inferences</b> made from the two passages read, or the number of <b>inferences</b> made in response to the oral recall or oral introspection directions. Furthermore, none of the interactions between or among these three factors was significant. Statistically significant differences were found in the following areas related to the types of <b>inferences</b> made: males made fewer logical <b>inferences</b> and females made more logical <b>inferences</b> than expected; one passage yielded more informational but fewer evaluative <b>inferences,</b> and the other passage yielded fewer informational but more evaluative <b>inferences</b> than expected; oral recall directions resulted in fewer logical and evaluative <b>inferences</b> but more informational <b>inferences</b> that expected; and oral introspection directions resulted in more logical and evaluative <b>inferences</b> but fewer informational <b>inferences</b> than expected...|$|R

Three experiments used the three phases of the process dissociation experimental paradigm (Jacoby, 1991) to partition the controlled, recollective contributions to text retrieval from the automatic, familiarity-based contributions.

40|$|Objectives. When used in subject-verb-object sentences, {{abstract}} verbs seem {{to elicit}} stronger causal <b>inferences</b> about {{the object and}} stronger personality <b>inferences</b> about the subject than concrete verbs. One possible explanations for this paradox is that inferring traits and explaining behaviors imply different cognitive mechanisms. The second is that verb abstraction affects <b>inferences</b> about the subject and the object in a curvilinear manner so that the paradox occurs because different studies have compared different verb levels. The present {{study was designed to}} compare the two explanations. Design and methods. Participants read subject-verb-object sentences with descriptive action verbs, interpretative action verbs and state verbs. Half of them rated the degree to which each interactant caused the event, the other half rated {{the degree to which the}} events were informative about each interactant’ personality Results. Participants made stronger <b>inferences</b> about the subject and weaker <b>inferences</b> about the object from interpretative than from descriptive action verbs. They made weaker <b>inferences</b> about the subject and stronger <b>inferences</b> about the object from state verbs than from both interpretative and descriptive action verbs.

Verb abstraction affects causality and personality <b>inferences</b> in a curvilinear manner. Therefore, studies on the effect of verb abstraction on <b>inferences</b> should compare multiple verb types and that researchers seeking to explain the effect of verb abstraction on <b>inferences</b> from descriptions of interpersonal events should explain a curvilinear rather than a linear trend. status: publishe...|$|R

This view is inadequate because there are <b>inferences,</b> such as the abductive ones, that are neither ampliative nor truth preserving. In this paper an alternative classification of <b>inferences</b> is proposed, {{as well as a}} justification of deductive, nondeductive and abductive <b>inferences</b> which takes into account their role in knowledge, distinguishing their justification from their usefulness. It is argued that the justification of deductive, non-deductive and abductive <b>inferences</b> raises similar problems and is to be approached much in the same way...|$|R
