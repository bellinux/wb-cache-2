CBS has more than 60 programs in the portfolio, each managed by an autonomous Study Board. The paper demonstrates how CBS has addressed these challenges in a quality policy based on two main elements. Standards and Guidelines {{for day to day}} quality operations are combined with recurrent 5 year cycle peer reviews of every program. It is demonstrated how optimal use of existing information from various sources can be combined to provide a parsimonious picture of program performance, without putting too much burden on program managers. Both external and internal peer reviewers are used in order to create dialogue, mutual inspiration, increased alignment across programs, and balance between formative development and summative assessment.

But standardization is not without problems since it brings negative effects {{that need to be}} considered. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the units within the company in order to identify differences and important factors when considering standardization. The study also intends to contribute to the knowledge concerning standardization by identifying essential factors for a successful implementation, based on how the company operates at present. This intends to result in recommendations for the company to use when standardizing their processes regarding POC. Methodology: This study consists of a qualitative case study on a company, which is in the process of implementing standardization. Interviews were performed in three of the company’s Swedish offices. Conclusion: The study shows that standardization will bring several benefits for the company and the recommendations are to proceed with the implementation process. The company must however take action in order to make the implementation possible. By introducing a mutual template for models, document best-in-class procedures and adopt them, set procedures for storing essential documents, and increase the knowledge and understanding for other units’ procedures and needs...|$|R

40|$|The present {{economic}} {{context is}} heavily {{marked by a}} global crisis without precedents. Facing this constraint, companies feel pressured to undertake even greater efforts in order to optimize available resources. Work organisation {{is one of the}} mechanisms that managers use to align human resources with that kind of constraints and, thus, develop a better response to the market. Organisational literature shows that flexible and <b>decentralized</b> work <b>organisation</b> models are better suited to this need. These models stress the importance of human resources in promoting a flexible organization capable of change and adapt to market contingencies. This perspective can be seen on the adoption of participation, decentralization of the decision process and information, cooperation among workers through the implementation of working teams. The characteristics of human resources, namely their social and technical skills, knowledge and their ability to learn new things, are frequently pointed out as a key factor for the success of these models. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} understand the role of human and social capital for the success of flexible organisation practices. In order to accomplish this goal, it is developed an analysis of European countries from 1990 to 2005, using data from World Values Survey (WVS) and European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{human genome}} project was a grand {{scientific}} enterprise which attracted both hyperbole and ridicule alike. The project was lauded as “the moon shot of the life sciences”, the “holy grail of man”, “the code of codes”, and “the book of life”. Such rhetoric has also received scorn. President George Bush senior managed to deflate the pretensions of the project with the accidental slip {{that it was the}} “human gnome initiative”. In The Sequence, Kevin Davies seeks to go beyond such metaphors, and provide a candid and honest account of the race of the {{human genome project}}. The author is indebted to the authoritative book The Gene Wars, which considered the early struggles over the human genome project. Robert Cook-Deegan observes that there was initially much debate over whether there should be a Human Genome Project at all: The debate became one of “big” science versus “small” science. The reliance on systematic technology development and goal-directed gene-mapping efforts presaged a new style for biology, one that elicited excitement from those attracted to whiz-bang technologies but drew gasps of revulsion from those who aspired to cultivate biology on a more modest scale and with <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation.</b> The battle was, among other things, over whose vision would control the budget and which scientific aesthetic would prevail...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages for concepts of <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation</b> with the production, couldn't proved empirically for the time being. Decentralized concepts force the need of changes within the availability of acquiring information within the production field. In detail, this means the need of modern IT for experience-directed acting of skilled workers. The major focus within performing the project was a close and participating involvement of all related skilled workers within the global development process. Evaluation workhops and iterative implementation steps should grant an enduser-focused solution. Common visions {{have been developed to}} describe the overall objectives and to avoid different understandings of project basics. Therefore, skilled workers and other experts of the companies Seifert and Maschinenteilewerk Kamenz have been involved. All project partners participated on activities for qualification for efficient cooperation within the project. A specification based on a requirement catalogue has been worked out for a first software implementation. Finally, an evaluation version of a Facharbeiter Informationssystem (FIS) has been completed. This software has been presented and evaluated within the user companies. FIS allows to manage the informal information flows within the shop-floor and to document and widen the knowledge and experience of the workers. FIS could be a platform to bundle historically grown IT systems in the shop-floor. (orig.)

40|$|Master of EducationFrom {{the late}} seventies to 1986 the Adult Migrant Education Services (AMES) in Victoria changed, from a simple {{organisation}} structure managed by direct supervision, to an extensive organisation with a complex organisation structure managed through delegated responsibility. The impetus for {{this study is the}} observation that policy decision-making processes are not generally understood by organisation members. The purpose of the study is to contribute to an increased understanding of decision-making processes in the Adult Migrant Education Services by examining the characteristics and determining conditions and outcomes of these decision-making processes. The objects of study are a number of principals of Adult Migrant Education Centres and senior AMES staff. Their participation and influence on two policy decisions at State level is examined with regard to past, present and future aspects of organisational development. The theoretical focus of the study concerns the location of the decision-making power within the organisation and the identification of the relative forms of participation in a policy decision. Two models for analysing the processes of decision-making were used, as presented in the works of Thomas Dye and Per Erik Ellström. A system devised to permit classification of forms of participation was used to identify the dimension of participation in policy decision-making. Data was collected through recorded and verbatim reports of interviews, minutes, internal organisational reports and government reports. As the study progressed, AMES management made the first steps towards corporate planning and program budgeting. The initial impact of such planning on the participation of principals and senior staff in policy decisions is described. As a result of the analysis of the data it is found that the lack of legitimate participative policy generating processes and structures at principal level was related to the lack of strategic planning. In conclusion, examples of the overall management function of the middle and senior level in a <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation</b> is suggested. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

Although open data has considerable socio-economic, environmental and governance benefits, it is {{does not provide}} an immediate or reliable source of revenue. Without an immediate and continued source of funding, the future of OpenLitterMap is not only uncertain, but bleak. Finances to map and produce open data on the pollution being caused largely by the products of {{a small number of}} global corporations have not been identified. To accept donations and give members a voice in the future of the OpenLitterMap ecosystem, a non-profit, the OpenLitterMap Foundation is being established. Several Ambassadors have joined the pre-liminary team from Ireland, Australia, the U.K., and the U.S.A. who are interested in promoting OpenLitterMap locally and we hope to have our first online AGM and elect the first committee in 2018. Following the development of more advanced and potentially commercial features we aim to transfer the cost away from data producers to sources of pollution (eg. corporations) who need to improve their image and social responsibility. Similarly, data consumers (eg. Local Authorities) need advanced analytics and near-real time insights. However, because litter mapping is a relatively new field of Geographical Information Science, neither of these institutions have the structures in place to enable the development of OpenLitterMap. In lieu of a grant or philanthropy, micro-financial monthly crowdfunding contributions averaging € 5 from just ~[*] 1000 individuals worldwide who believe in and would like to see OpenLitterMap survive and be developed further offer a means of achieving growth and sustainability. To facilitate monthly crowdfunding donations, stripe.com provides a secure and established way of processing euros, pounds and dollars over an encrypted network.

Donations can also be made via Stripe, or by using trustless decentralized stateless payment infrastructures such as Bitcoin and Ethereum at openittermap.com/donate. By crowdfunding the development of OpenLitterMap, users can enjoy the updates and will be able to participate in guiding future developments.

40|$|Background and aims: Due to an ever {{increasing}} number of type 2 diabetes patients, innovations to control the increasing health care use and costs are needed. Results of diabetes care programs on the costs or (cost-) effectiveness are heterogeneous. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the cost-effectiveness of two diabetes care models with usual care for type 2 diabetes patients from the societal perspective. Materials and methods: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a clinical trial. In two distinct regions of the Netherlands, two diabetes care models were implemented with different levels of centralized organizational structures. One of them was centralized care (CC) with a central organization and coordination of the care between all care providers and the use of a central database. Patients receive an annual extended diabetes assessment at the Diabetes Care Centre, in addition to the care by patients' general practitioner (GP). GP's receive feedback about their performance. Partly centralized care (PC) focuses on adherence to type 2 diabetes guidelines. An online clinical database is used to monitor mean values of risk factors. All assessments were performed in patient's GP practice. Usual care (UC) has a <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation</b> structure and patients' GP is responsible for the diabetes care. Clinical outcome measure was risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) calculated with the UKDPS risk engine. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective comparing patients receiving CC (n= 313), PC (n= 293) and UC (n= 485) during one year of follow-up. Missing costs and effects data were imputed using multiple imputation. Differences in costs, effects and cost-effectiveness between the diabetes care groups were analysed using bootstrapping techniques. Results: Differences in changes in CHD risk over 12 months of follow-up between the three groups were statistically insignificant and clinically irrelevant. Compared to UC, health care costs during the follow-up period were lower in CC (- 1300 (95 % CI: - 2300 to - 570)) and PC (- 960 (95 % CI: - 1890 to - 100)). Costs from the societal perspective showed the same trend, although not statistically significant. Conclusion: Clinical outcomes did not differ between the different care models. Lower health care costs were observed in (partly) centralized care compared to usual care, mainly due to substitution of secondary health care use by primary health care use. This suggests that centralizing the diabetes care results in equal outcomes at lower health care costs...|$|E
40|$|Changing factors within markets, such as {{continually}} shortening {{product life}} cycles, increasing competition due to shorter development and order processing times, manufacturing in intercompany networks and the individualization of customer needs, create new requirements which manufacturing organizations {{are expected to}} fulfil. To be successful, manufacturing organizations and business processes have to be transformable to cope with these environmental changes [1]. That's why the creation and implementation of self-adaptive production systems represents one vision of the near future, offering the ability to detect important changes, simulate the impacts of these changes and generate suggestions for an optimised configuration. A first step {{on the way to}} self-adaptive production systems is the transition from a nonrecurring, static planning und operation cycle to a continuous replanning and reconfiguration of work systems, supported by new planning methods and tools. In order to realize continuous replanning and reconfiguration, planning methods and tools have to meet new requirements: production modelling should be fast, and the model structure modular in order to enable quick and economical changes by the production planner. Within internal or external production networks, defined sectors have to be planned, simulated and optimised both separately and in combination with others. In temporary inter-company production, as realized in virtual companies, different production models must be able to communicate online with each other using new information technology such as the Internet. The paper presents a solution for an integrated planning tool, based on object-oriented, generic simulation models. The tool supports the production planner in adjusting the production system to changing product demand or corporate goals. It enables the planner in a <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation</b> to model, simulate and evaluate his area of accountability, and to generate proposals for reconfiguration. Because no specialized knowledge of simulation programming is needed, model composition or input and structure parameter modification can be performed by the planner himself. Flexible production planning modules (FPPMs) are the core elements of the solution. By using these modules, machines and groups of machines can be compounded to subsystems which can then be replanned by a decentralized planning group. Because of the hierarchical composition of such a model, it is also possible to group the FPPMs repeatedly in order to improve the production system as a whole. The interconnection between the individual FPPMs, as well as between the FPPMs and the evaluation and optimisation unit, takes place through plug-and-play interfaces. The generic simulation model is generated using structure data and the FPPMs. After combining different FPPMs to a practical simulation model, the evaluation unit and the optimisation unit are added automatically. During the optimisation cycles, the simulation results are compared to firm-specific goals. The optimisation unit, based on an evolutionary algorithm, creates a population of possible new configurations which are the starting point for the next optimisation cycle. Thereby future production systems will be flexible, mobile, agile and temporary, thus meeting the requirements of the turbulent market environment. The breadth and depth of the production planner's tasks will increase substantially within this environment. With this proposed planning tool, the planner obtains an instrument to realize self-optimisation, to react to changes in his company's objectives and environment...|$|E
40|$|Photoperiod {{manipulation}} {{is routinely}} {{used in the}} aquaculture industry with the aim to enhance growth by manipulating the timing of reproduction in several commercially important temperate fish species. However, there are clear gaps {{in our understanding of}} how photoperiod is perceived by the circadian axis and transmitted to the brain to alter reproduction. Furthermore, due to the wide range of environments inhabited by fish, it is unlikely that one single organization exists. It is therefore believed that comparative studies of temperate species “models” with tropical species such as the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) that adapted to different environments characterized by weaker light signals can help in such an aim. A number of studies were therefore performed in this PhD project to expand our knowledge on circadian biology and environmental physiological effects in African catfish. The first aim was to characterize the circadian melatonin system in this species (chapter 3). Results clearly showed that the control of melatonin production by the pineal gland was very different in the African catfish as compared to temperate species such as salmon and trout. Indeed, melatonin production appeared to mainly depend on light stimuli perceived by the eyes as opposed to salmonids where light directly perceived by the pineal gland regulates its own melatonin production within photoreceptors. The main evidence was obtained in ophthalmectomised fish that were unable to synthesize and release melatonin into the blood circulation during the dark period. This {{was the first time that}} such a <b>decentralized</b> <b>organisation,</b> similar in a way to the mammalian system, was found in any teleost species. In vitro results also supported such findings as African catfish pineal glands in isolation were not able to normally produce melatonin at night as usually seen in all other fish species studied so far. This indirectly suggested that pineal gland photo-sensitivity might be different in this tropical species. Further studies were performed to better determine the amount of light that can be perceived by the African catfish pineal gland depending on light transmittance though the skull (where the pineal gland is located). Surprisingly, it appeared that catfish cranium act as a stronger light filter than in other species resulting in lower light irradiance of the pineal gland. This could explain, although it still needs to be further confirmed, why African catfish photic control of melatonin produced by the pineal would have evolved differently than in temperate species. The work then focused on better characterizing diel melatonin production and endogenous entrainment through exposure to continuous photic regimes (continuous light, LL or darkness, DD) (chapter 4). Daily melatonin profiles of fish exposed to 12 L: 12 D photoperiod (routinely used in indoor systems) confirmed low melatonin production at day (< 10 pg/ml) and increase at night (50 pg/ml) as reported in most vertebrate species studied to date. Interestingly, results also showed that melatonin production or suppression can anticipate the change from night to day with basal melatonin levels observed 45 mins prior to the switch on of the light. These observations clearly suggest the involvement of a clock-controlled system of melatonin secretion that is capable of anticipating the next photophase period. Furthermore, when constant light (LL) was applied, day/night melatonin rhythms were abolished as expected due to the constant photic inhibition of AANAT activity (e. g. one of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of serotonin into melatonin). However when fish were exposed to constant darkness (DD), a strong endogenous melatonin rhythm (maintained for at least 4 days and 18 days in catfish and Nile tilapia respectively) was found, demonstrating once again the presence of robust circadian oscillators in this species. The next aim of the doctoral project was then to investigate circadian behaviour of catfish through locomotor activity studies (Chapter 5). African catfish is again a very interesting “model” due to its reported nocturnal activity rhythmicity as compared to most other teleosts species. Locomotor activity is considered as a very useful tool to elucidate the mechanisms of circadian organization in both invertebrates and vertebrates circadian. Results first confirmed the nocturnal activity rhythms in the species. Furthermore, clear circadian endogenous rhythms were observed under constant light (LL) or darkness (DD) during several days before losing rhythmicity. Interestingly, the activity levels varied depending on the stocking density. Finally, the last aim of this project was to test the effects of a range of photoperiodic manipulations on growth performances, sexual development and reproductive performances in African catfish reared from eggs to puberty. Results did not show any differences at the early sages (up to 90 days post hatching) in growth performances nor mortality (high) between control 12 L: 12 D and LL treatments. In contrast, during the juvenile-adult period (from 120 to 360 DPH), significant growth effects were observed, as previously reported in other catfish species, with fish under LL displaying lower growth rate, food consumption and feed conversion efficiency in comparison to most other treatments (12 : 12, LL, 6 : 6, 6 : 18, 12 -LL and LL- 12) especially 12 l: 12 D. However, no major effects of the photoperiodic treatments were observed with all fish recruited into puberty and developing gonads although differences in the timing of gametogenesis could be observed, especially a delay (circa 2 months) in females exposed to short daylength (6 L: 18 D and 6 L: 6 D). As for egg quality, egg diameter was the only parameter to differ between treatments (slightly larger in egg batch from LL treated females). Overall, none of the photoperiodic regime suppressed maturation in African catfish as opposed to some temperate species. The work carried out during this PhD project clearly advanced our understanding of circadian rhythmicity, light perception and effects of photoperiod on physiology in a tropical species. Future studies are now required to further characterise the circadian system and link it to evolutionary trends within vertebrates.
