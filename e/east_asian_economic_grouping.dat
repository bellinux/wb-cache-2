30|$|In the 1980 s, with {{increased}} <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> development, attention {{was paid to}} the relationship between the <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> sphere and the “Confucian cultural sphere.”For example, South Korean scholar Kim Don-hun noted in Confucian Cultural Sphere and Economic Order that the most significant feature of Confucianism is the doctrine that family serves as a basis for social order and underpins the economic development of the “Confucian cultural sphere.” (Kim Don-hun, 1991) Leon Vandermeersch, in his book Asian Cultural Sphere,held that <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> prosperity has a direct relationship with the ongoing Confucian civilization revival. American scholar William Theodore de Bary emphasized the liberalism and individualism of Confucianism in Zhiism and Tradition of Freedom (William Theodore de Bary, 1987). In East and Southeast Asia, many communities, especially the Chinese community, accepted different aspects of the Chinese Confucian tradition. Anthropologists who focus on Southeast Asian Chinese society are more concerned with the similarities and differences {{in the structure of the}} Confucianism-based society.

40|$|One {{of the key}} sets of {{questions}} underlying Asia Pacific economic cooperation {{over the last decade}} has been over the nature and form of the regional trade architecture that would gradually emerge from the turmoil of the Asia-Pacific “noodle bowl” of bilateral and plurilateral FTAs, and how that architecture would accommodate the separate impulses of <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> and trans-Pacific <b>economic</b> integration. Calls for <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration took center-stage {{in the wake of the}} <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> crisis of 1997 / 98, and were quickly reflected in the proposal for an <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> Free Trade Area (EAFTA) based on the ASEAN plus Three groups. The subsequent development of the so-called “ASEAN Plus One” FTAs both provided a feasible way forward in the absence of a politically viable basis for integration among the major Northeast Asian economies, and also entrenched the idea of <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration as an “ASEAN-centered” process. Japan’s proposal for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA), based on an ASEAN plus Six groups of countries that comprised the then membership of the <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> Summit (EAS), subsequently provided an alternative configuration for a region-wide trade bloc based on East Asia. Since then the EAFTA and CEPEA initiatives have moved forward in parallel, but no agreement has been reached to commence formal negotiations in either case. This paper has presented the state of play and future outlook for each of the three initiatives as they appeared at the time of the 2010 APEC leaders’ meeting.

The relationship {{between the state and the}} market is still set up in a hierarchical fashion in favor of the former. The economic system to emerge in East Asia is the state-governed rather than market-centered, even if it has absorbed neo-liberal condiments. The state-dominant economic system of East Asia is expected to survive for a considerable period. In this regard, the establishment of a financial system to sustain the <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> system has been strongly suggested.

40|$|Two presumptions {{appear to}} {{underlie}} recent proposals for <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration. The {{first is that}} economic integration {{is a good way}} to promote economic growth. The second is that preferential trade agreements (PTAs), particularly ones that go beyond goods trade, are an effective way to promote economic integration. Both these presumptions are empirical questions. In this paper, a partial evaluation of the evidence suggests caution. Even a broadranging PTA may do little to remove the important impediments to growth in the region. Far greater income gains would come from comprehensive reform of non-discriminatory impediments to competition, as part of a thorough-going programme of unilateral domestic regulatory reform.

40|$|<b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> {{development}} in the post-World War II period has few historical parallels. In a short span of thirty-some years Japan was transformed from a war-devastated country into an economic powerhouse {{second only to the}} United States while other poverty-stricken, agricultural economies of the region have been transformed into newly industrializing economies. By being the region's most technologically advanced, dynamic and rich economy and by being their major trading partner and source of foreign investment, Japan has played a highly instrumental role in the economic development of its neighboring economies. Paraphrasing the term originally coined by Professor Akamatsu, some have compared this pattern of <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> development to a Rock of flying geese with Japan at its head followed by the NIEs and near-NIES of Southeast Asia.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2000 Dr. Philip Andrew MacDonaldThis thesis is {{an examination of the}} forces behind the increasing levels of intra-regional economic integration in East Asia. Economic integration in Europe, {{and to a lesser extent}} in North America, was preceded by an adaptation of political agreements and institutions which, in turn, largely determined the further pattern of economic regionalisation. Economic integration in East Asia did not experience such a prerequisite settlement. <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration, unlike economic integration in other regions around the globe, is being driven by the growing interdependence between transnational corporations (TNCs), and in many instances, small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), strategies, and regional governments policies. The thesis examines the process of intra-regional economic integration in East Asia from three levels of analysis: state-state, state-firm and firm-firm. The discussion seeks to go beyond the “state versus market” analysis of regional economic integration and aims to present an ‘alternative’ framework of analysis by discussing the dynamics of the growing relationship between states and firms. In order to ‘capture’ this relationship, the dissertation examines the interplay between the forces of globalisation and regionalisation. The findings of the three case studies, together with the analysis of globalisation and regionalisation, have demonstrated the need to move beyond the state versus market dichotomy. <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration is occurring at three levels: state-state, state-firm and firm-firm. The forces behind <b>East</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>economic</b> integration include cooperation and competition between states, bargaining between states and firms, and the activities of TNCs and SMEs. Changes in the global economy affect the pattern of economic integration at the regional level. Understanding how these changes impact on state policies and firm strategies is vital to analysing regional economic integration. Open Acces...|$|R
