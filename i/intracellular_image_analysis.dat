40|$|In {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTP), {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) processes are performed by mixed cultures containing polyphosphate (PAO) and glycogen accumulating organisms (GAO). In these processes, it is of crucial importance to monitor the intracellular metabolism, namely glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polyphosphate (polyP) inclusions, to determine its efficiency. However, traditional monitoring, carried out through off-line chemical analyses, is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop new techniques to promptly quantify these <b>intracellular</b> polymers, with <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> emerging as a promising tool. The use of staining methodologies with specific fluorescent dyes is widespread in EBPR research, including Nile blue for PHA and DAPI for polyP. Although rarely applied in EBPR studies, Aniline blue is a fluorescent stain {{that can be used for}} glycogen determination. Furthermore, these fluorescent stains have generally been employed for qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. Therefore, this study aim focused on developing fluorescence-based staining methodologies for glycogen, and on acquisition, processing and <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures for PHA, polyP and glycogen. <b>Image</b> <b>analysis</b> data was then correlated wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of herpesvirus remains incompletely defined {{due to the}} structural complexity of these viruses. Although the {{assembly of}} the capsid of these large DNA viruses is well studied and reasonably well conserved for all members of this diverse family of viruses, the cytoplasmic processes of tegumentation and envelopment are not well understood. The virion of the largest human herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), contains over 70 virus-encoded proteins that are incorporated during a nuclear and cytoplasmic phase of assembly. Envelopment of this virus requires the function {{of at least one}} tegument protein, pp 28, the product of the UL 99 open reading frame. However, the role of pp 28 in the envelopment of HCMV remains undefined. We have generated a pp 28 mutant virus that encodes only the first 50 amino acids (aa) of this 190 -aa virion protein. This virus is replication impaired and is defective in virus assembly. Characterization of both intracellular and extracellular virions from cells infected with this viral mutant indicated that the decrease in production of infectious virus was secondary to a defect in envelopment and the accumulation of tegumented, noninfectious <b>intracellular</b> particles. <b>Image</b> <b>analysis</b> using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that the pp 28 mutant protein encoded by this virus failed to efficiently accumulate in the virus assembly compartment (AC). Our results suggest that pp 28 must accumulate in the AC for efficient envelopment of the particle and provide evidence for a direct role of this tegument protein in the late stages of assembly, such as envelopment...|$|R
