Therefore, many ongoing efforts have been focusing on the causality of gut microbiota derived metabolites in CVD. Key methodologies include randomized controlled trials (Tang et al., 2013; Panigrahi et al., 2017), Mendelian randomization approach (Mendelson et al., 2017) and <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animal</b> models (Hibberd et al., 2017).|$|E

The gnotobiotic and conventional groups were infected orally with 10 ² and 10 (5) cfu of S. Typhimurium, respectively, 7 days after the beginning of treatment. Control groups were treated with sterile saline instead of Lactobacillus. Survival data showed a protective effect against the pathogenic bacteria in both conventional and gnotobiotic Lactobacillus-treated mice. L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 colonized the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice {{and the number of}} viable cells ranged from 10 (9) to 10 (10) cfu/g of faeces.

A higher mean survival time (P < 0. 05) was observed in L. murinus-associated animals (7. 89 ± 3. 83 days) when compared with the control ones (4. 44 ± 0. 73 days). Lactobacillus murinus exerted a potent antagonistic effect in vivo against S. sonnei {{and to a lesser extent}} against S.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of the human gut bacterial community that is recalcitrant to culture remains poorly defined. In this report, we combine high-throughput anaerobic culturing techniques with <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animal</b> husbandry and metagenomics {{to show that the}} human fecal microbiota consists largely of taxa and predicted functions that are represented in its readily cultured members. When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, complete and cultured communities exhibit similar colonization dynamics, biogeographical distribution, and responses to dietary perturbations. Moreover, gnotobiotic mice can be used to shape these personalized culture collections to enrich for taxa suited to specific diets. We also demonstrate that thousands of isolates from a single donor can be clonally archived and taxonomically mapped in multiwell format to create personalized microbiota collections. Retrieving components of a microbiota that have coexisted in single donors who have physiologic or disease phenotypes of interest and reuniting them in various combinations in gnotobiotic mice should facilitate preclinical studies designed to determine the degree to which tractable bacterial taxa are able to transmit donor traits or influence host biology...|$|E

40|$|Obesity and its {{associated}} metabolic disorders are a worldwide epidemic. In humans, obesity causes changes in gut microbial composition. Analysis {{of the consequences of}} these changes for host energy metabolism, particularly in the context of obesity, requires good experimental models. The use of <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animal</b> models has indicated new mediators and molecular targets that suggest a metabolic dialogue between the gut bacteria and the host. The discovery of the impact of a high-fat diet on metabolic disorders linked to gut microbiota has revealed bacterial components (lipopolysaccharides and Toll-like receptors) as potential targets in the management of obesity and related disorders. In animal models, it has been possible to effect specific changes to the gut microbiota through food components with prebiotic properties, thereby decreasing obesity and {{its associated}} metabolic alterations, including inflammation. The relevance of this approach in the management of obesity in humans is supported by a number of intervention studies. A metagenomic and integrative metabolomic approach could help in the discovery of which bacteria, among the trillions in the human gut, are specifically involved in the control of host energy metabolism. This knowledge could be relevant for future therapeutic developments in the prevention of obesity and related metabolic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{an agent}} {{involved}} {{in the development of}} antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The purpose of this work was to investigate the role of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in resistance to colonization by C. difficile by using a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animal</b> model. Accordingly, germfree mice were associated with different hamster flora, and the VFAs in their cecal contents were measured by gas chromatography. The results showed that VFAs were produced mainly by the intestinal flora, especially by the strictly anaerobic bacteria. In these associated mice, the concentrations of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids were higher than those of other acids, but at pH 6. 8 the MICs of these three acids in vitro for C. difficile were more than 200 mu eq/ml. In gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with C. difficile and in the isolated ceca of these mice, VFAs did not inhibit the growth of C. difficile. In gnotobiotic mice which were diassociated with C. difficile and C. butyricum and given drinking water with a lactose concentration of 20 %, the cecal contents included about the same amount of butyric acid as did those of the monoassociated mice, although the population of C. difficile remained the same. Therefore, it is suggested that VFAs alone cannot inhibit intestinal colonization by C. difficile and that, consequently, other inhibitory mechanisms are also present...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GIT) of adult mammals is colonized by {{a complex and}} dynamic community of microorganisms. Most protection against potential pathogens occurs via a mucosal immune system involving mechanisms of innate immunity {{as well as a}} secondary lymphoid organ, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). However, the bacterial community also supports its host against invasion by potential pathogens, by a mechanism called 'colonization resistance'. Young animals need time to develop both a complex bacterial community and their immature GIT immune system, and until such developments have taken place, they are vulnerable to the presence of potential pathogens in their GIT. Initial protection against invading pathogens is provided by milk and colostrum, which contain antibodies and other bioactive components. At weaning, with the introduction of solid food and deprivation of the mother's milk, the young must also cope with a rapidly changing microbiota. The colonizing microbiota not only provides colonization resistance to potentially pathogenic bacteria. It also has {{a major role in the}} development of the intestinal immune system, both in terms of GALT development and mucosal immunity, and the induction of oral tolerance. Studies using <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animal</b> models have revealed that the presence of even limited numbers of the indigenous microbiota may influence the GIT immune system.

Such animals are normally reared in a sterile or microbially-controlled laboratory environment, and they are only exposed to those microorganisms that the researchers wish to have present in the animal. These gnotobiotes are used to study the symbiotic relationships between an animal and {{one or more of}} the microorganisms that may inhabit its body.

40|$|Microbiological {{standardization}} {{in laboratory}} animal breeding {{is based on}} the classification according to the microorganisms that the animals host and consequently their upbringing environment, as well as the certification of their microbiological status and the protection of their properties. Although there are many different classifications for microbiological standardization of laboratory animals, they can be basically classified as; <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals,</b> animals bred with a complete barrier system (Germ free, GF, with Colonization-Resistant Flora; CRF), animals bred with a partial barrier system (Specified Pathogen Free, SPF), and animals bred by conventional methods in units without barriers (Conventional; CV). Monitoring of microbiological standardization is carried out in two ways. One is controlling barrier systems (process control) and the other is controlling laboratory animals (product control). In controlling barrier systems samples are taken routinely from ambient air, surfaces, base plate materials of animals, foods and waters, and microbiological tests are carried out. FELASA guidelines are frequently used in monitoring laboratory animals. These guidelines where the monitoring frequency, sample size, micro-organisms to be tested, vary according to the microbiological quality of the animals, and test methods and are frequently updated by FELASA and shared in their web pages.

Conventional and gnotobiotic mice contaminated with a defined microbiota without Gram-negative bacteria were subjected to either a sham procedure or HS/R. Tissue samples were obtained 4 h later for assessing ileal mucosal permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and hepatic and ileal mucosal steady-state IL- 6, iNOS, COX- 2 and TNF mRNA levels. Whereas HS/R significantly increased ileal mucosal permeability in conventional mice, this effect was not apparent in <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals.</b> HS/R markedly increased hepatic mRNA levels for several pro-inflammatory genes in both conventional and gnotobiotic mice.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the microecology of Clostridium difficile provides for a better under-standing of the disease that this organism causes. C. difficile is not a significant component of the microflora in the colon of healthy adult humans or animals; however, it can establish large populations in antibiotic-treated or <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> and in infants before they acquire a complete flora. Major factors that {{determine whether or not}} disease develops are: (1) the size of the C. difficile population; (2) the toxigenicity of the colonizing strain; (3) the presence of other organisms that affect toxin expression or activity; (4) susceptibility of the host; and possibly (5) a strain's adhesion to colonic epithelium. The rest of the colonic flora determines the size of the C. difficile population, at least in part by limiting available nutrients.

40|$|Gut {{bacteria}} exert beneficial {{and harmful}} effects in metabolic diseases as deduced from {{the comparison of}} germfree and conventional mice and from fecal transplantation studies. Compositional microbial changes in diseased subjects {{have been linked to}} adiposity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Promotion of an increased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters or a modified lipid and bile acid metabolism by the intestinal microbiota could result in an increased nutrient absorption by the host. The degradation of dietary fiber and the subsequent fermentation of monosaccharides to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) {{is one of the most}} controversially discussed mechanisms of how gut bacteria impact host physiology. Fibers reduce the energy density of the diet, and the resulting SCFA promote intestinal gluconeogenesis, incretin formation and subsequently satiety.

Inflammatory lesions occurred in such microinfected quarters, however, and were similar to but less severe than lesions in quarters infected with coagulase-positive staphylococci 21. 22. Resistance to experimental infections was found in quarters producing milk high in leuco-cyteslv 17. A mild inflammatory reaction produced by organisms of low virulence might inhibit organisms of higher virulence*.

In spite of this, most members of the human microbiota are largely unknown and remain still uncultured. The final functionality of the microbiota is depending not only on nutrient availability and environmental conditions, but also on the interrelationships that the microorganisms inhabiting the same ecological niche are able to establish with their partners, or with their potential competitors. Therefore, in such a competitive environment microorganisms have had to develop strategies allowing them to cope, adapt, or cooperate with their neighbors, which may imply notable changes at metabolic, physiological and genetic level.

40|$|Background Inappropriate {{cross talk}} between mammals and their gut {{microbiota}} may trigger intestinal inflammation and drive extra-intestinal immune-mediated diseases. Epithelial cells constitute {{the interface between}} gut microbiota and host tissue, and may regulate host responses to commensal enteric bacteria. <b>Gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> represent a powerful approach to study bacterial-host interaction but are not readily accessible to the wide scientific community. We aimed at refining a protocol that in a robust manner would deplete the cultivable intestinal microbiota of conventionally raised mice and that would prove to have significant biologic validity. Methodology/Principal Findings Previously published protocols for depleting mice of their intestinal microbiota by administering broad-spectrum antibiotics in drinking water were difficult to reproduce. We show that twice daily delivery of antibiotics by gavage depleted mice of their cultivable fecal microbiota and reduced the fecal bacterial DNA load by 400 fold while ensuring the animals' health. Mice subjected to the protocol for 17 days displayed enlarged ceca, reduced Peyer's patches and small spleens. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the expression of antimicrobial factors to a level {{similar to that of}} germ-free mice and altered the expression of 517 genes in total in the colonic epithelium. Genes involved in cell cycle were significantly altered concomitant with reduced epithelial proliferative activity in situ assessed by Ki- 67 expression, suggesting that commensal microbiota drives cellular proliferation in colonic epithelium. Conclusion We present a robust protocol for depleting conventionally raised mice of their cultivatable intestinal microbiota with antibiotics by gavage and show that the biological effect of this depletion phenocopies physiological characteristics of germ-free mice...|$|R

Previously, we have demonstrated the immunoregulatory, anti-allergic, anti-asthmatic and anti-colitis abilities of L. kefiranofaciens M 1 {{in a number of}} in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. However, whether the effects of L. kefiranofaciens M 1 are elicited directly on the host or act by regulating the host’s microbiota remains unknown. A number of studies have used germ-free or <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> to investigate the relationship between probiotics and colitis; therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of L. kefiranofaciens M 1 on germ-free mice. Such an approach should help in determining the direct effects of L. kefiranofaciens M 1 on the host itself. Four-week-old female germ-free mice were inoculated intragastrically with 26108 CFU/ mouse L. kefiranofaciens M 1 once or at 2 -day intervals for 14 days. Bacterial colonization, the Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine profile of the mice’s splenocytes and the anti-colitis effect of L. kefiranofaciens M 1 were investigated. The strongest response in terms of splenic Th 1 cytokine IFN-c and IL- 12 production upon TLR activation was detected in the continuous treatment group when comparing to the single inoculation group and the germ-free control. In addition, continuous inoculation with L. kefiranofaciens M 1 was found to ameliorate the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in germ-free mice. However, L. kefiranofaciens M 1 failed to colonize the host. Thus it would seem that L. kefiranofaciens M 1 is likely to act directly on the host and not be involved in microbiota regulation...|$|R
40|$|The current {{regulation}} of residues of antimicrobial {{veterinary medicinal products}} resulting from the treatment of food-producing animals in the European Union (EU) is reviewed and results of {{the application of the}} regulation are presented. European legislation concerning the control of residues of veterinary medicinal products requires the evaluation of antimicrobial properties of residues of such products. Three evaluation approaches are accepted: (i) human data, (ii) data to demonstrate no-observed-effect-levels obtained in gnotobiotic human gut ora associated (HFA) animals or (iii) the calculation of a microbiological acceptable daily intake (ADI) from in vitro minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) data. By September 1999, a total of 55 antimicrobial substances of 16 different classes were evaluated in the EU with respect to the safety of their residues to the consumer and for 46 of these the microbiological effects of their residues was assessed. In most instances (41 substances) in vitro MIC data were used for the evaluation and an arbitrary microbiological ADI was calculated. Sufcient human data were present only for tetracyclines (tetra-, chlortetra-, oxytetra- and doxycycline) and adequate data from <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> (human gut ora-associated rats or mice) were available only for tilmicosin. However, only for 39 of the 55 compounds the antimicrobial effects of residues were considered the most relevant for the overall safety assessment, while for 16 compounds of 5 different classes the toxicological effects were most relevant and their overall evaluation was based on a toxicological ADI.

40|$|Hepatic {{sulfation}} {{is thought}} to promote fecal excretion of lithocholate in humans by impairing the enterohepatic recirculation of the compound. Sulfatases produced by the gut flora may, at least in part, counteract this process. To investigate this interaction, female germfree rats, which are known to excrete considerable amounts of sulfated bile salts, were selectively associated with a bile salt desulfating flora. In these rats nearly all cecal, colonic, and fecal bile salt sulfate esters were hydrolyzed, resulting in a decrease of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 25 % compared with gnotobiotic rats without a bile salt desulfating flora. Desulfation of allochenodeoxycholate, the major sulfated bile salt in germfree rats, led to an enhanced recirculation and 12 alpha-hydroxylation of the compound in the liver, resulting in an increased fecal output of allocholate. Microbial desulfation of intraperitoneally injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate- 3 -sulfate caused a fivefold decrease of the fecal plus urinary excretion rate of the isotope to approximately that found for unsulfated [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. Coassociation of the gnotobiotic rats with a microflora that normalized the small intestinal transit time and cecal size led to a rise of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 30 % and a twofold accelerated excretion of both sulfated and unsulfated injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. We conclude that in rats the gut flora rapidly desulfates intestinal bile salt sulfates, enhancing the enterohepatic recirculation and subsequent hydroxylation of the desulfated bile salts. In addition, these data illustrate {{the importance of having}} a well-defined microflora to normalize intestinal transit time and cecal size of <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> when performing kinetic studies of enterohepatic circulating compounds. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the rat submaxillary gland (RSMG) virus haemagglntinin and its serum antihaemagglutinin, a d their incidence and relative titres in gnotobiotic and conventional Sprague-Dawley rats of various ages were investigated. The haemagglutinin was stable at- 55 ° {{for as long as}} 21 years and retained its activity after z hr at 6 o °. Various carbohydrases and cobra venom had no effect upon its titre; however, 2 × crystallized trypsin and pronase reduced the titre substantially. The haemagglutinin was not re-covered from the submaxillary glands of rats less than 8 weeks of age, though 3 -, 5 -, and 6 -week-old animals had low serum antihaemagglutinin titres. A general correlation was observed between the haemagglutinin a d anti-haemagglutinin titres of the animals; higher serum antihaemagglutinin titres occurred in those rats with higher haemagglutination titres. No significant difference was usually seen between the haemagglutination titres of gnoto-biotic and conventional rats of the same age. The antihaemagglutinin titres of some conventional rats, however, tended to be two- to fourfold greater than those of <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>animals</b> of comparable age with identical haemagglutina-tion titres. Sera which were heated at 56 ° for 3 o min. absorbed with kaolin, incubated with trypsin, potassium or sodium periodate, or receptor-destroying enzyme showed no reduction in their antihaemagglutinin titres. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation studies indicated that the anti-haemagglutinin was associated with the 7 S fraction; however, some sera showed antihaemagglutinin activity in the 19 S fraction.
