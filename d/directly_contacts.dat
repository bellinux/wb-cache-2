5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, <b>directly</b> <b>contacts</b> the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the high}} electron-ion and electron-molecule {{collision}} energies, the plasma volume acts as an efficient chemical reactor enabling fast production of chemical compounds of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. Among those, the short-lived highly reactive species are the main agents of the plasma activation of surfaces. They include atomic H, N and O species, OH and ON radicals, ozone, nitrous and nitric acids, as well as various other molecules in metastable excited states. Moreover, when the discharge <b>directly</b> <b>contacts</b> the substrate, the ions of these species {{as well as the}} electrons, both having high energies, bombard the surface.|$|E

5000|$|TAL effectors {{are found}} in {{bacterial}} plant pathogens of the genus Xanthomonas and are involved in regulating the genes of the host plant {{in order to facilitate}} bacterial virulence, proliferation, and dissemination. [...] They contain a central region of tandem 33-35 residue repeats and each repeat region encodes a single DNA base in the TALE's binding site. Within the repeat it is residue 13 alone that <b>directly</b> <b>contacts</b> the DNA base, determining sequence specificity, while other positions make contacts with the DNA backbone, stabilising the DNA-binding interaction. Each repeat within the array takes the form of paired alpha-helices, while the whole repeat array forms a right-handed superhelix, wrapping around the DNA-double helix. TAL effector repeat arrays have been shown to contract upon DNA binding and a two-state search mechanism has been proposed whereby the elongated TALE begins to contract around the DNA beginning with a successful Thymine recognition from a unique repeat unit N-terminal of the core TAL-effector repeat array.Related proteins {{are found in}} bacterial plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, the fungal endosymbiont Burkholderia rhizoxinica [...] and two as-yet unidentified marine-microorganisms. The DNA binding code and the structure of the repeat array is conserved between these groups, referred to collectively as the TALE-likes.|$|E

5000|$|X is an {{artificial}} intelligence created by Rui to oversee GALAX and perform data mining on all information gathered from its users globally {{to assist with}} his plans to update the world. It is an interactive AI that can readily communicate with all its users. It often provides helpful information, resources or even <b>directly</b> <b>contacts</b> nearby GALAX users to resolve problems. Rui sees it as his friend {{and the only one}} he can actually trust. X seems to harbour similar feelings for Rui. When Berg Katze takes advantage of this by hijacking it by stealing Rui's form, X is shown to be surprised and upset at [...] "Rui"'s change and sudden misdeeds. It reunites with Rui again though, after Rui tells it he saw the same sunset as X did before and thought the sky looked beautiful in contrast to the dismissive reply the fake Rui gave it. After Rui becomes an official Gatchaman, X is shown to connect with his transformed form where it provides him with constant support through the display screen on his chest, and is represented by the large X-shaped disc attached to his back. In Insight it has become involved in politics by allowing users to vote on who they want as mayor and even prime minister through their smart phones on GALAX, as well as allow the public to express their approval or disapproval in the current prime minister's actions with a new voting system.|$|E

40|$|Realization {{of logic}} {{circuits}} in graphene with an energy gap (EG) {{remains one of}} the main challenges for graphene electronics. We found that large transport EGs (> 100 meV) can be fulfilled in dual-gated bilayer graphene underneath a simple alumina passivation top gate stack, which <b>directly</b> <b>contacts</b> the graphene channels without an inserted buffer layer. With the presence of EGs, the electrical properties of the graphene transistors are significantly enhanced, as manifested by enhanced on/off current ratio, subthreshold slope and current saturation. For the first time, complementary-like semiconducting logic graphene inverters are demonstrated that show a large improvement over their metallic counterparts. This result may open the way for logic applications of gap-engineered graphene. Comment: Accepted by ACS Nan...|$|E
