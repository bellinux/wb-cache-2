The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>started</b> to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} has been to evaluate the suitability of commercially available early-weaning microdiets (MDs) {{for the production of}} sea bream early juveniles and in comparison with late-weaning protocols already in use by Hellenic marine fish hatcheries. Four sea bream experimental groups were allocated in rearing tanks of a commercial Hellenic marine fish hatchery. Each group represented a different protocol (A, B, CA, and CB) based on the combination of two different early-weaning MDs (A and B) and a late-weaning diet (C). In addition, the late-weaning protocols have received Artemia instar II only and not Artemia instar I. In protocol A, Artemia instar <b>I</b> <b>first</b> feeding and the early-weaning diet A were administered at 17 days post-hatch (17 dph). In protocol B, Artemia instar <b>I</b> <b>first</b> feeding <b>started</b> at 15 dph and the early-weaning diet B was administered at 18 dph. In the C protocols, Artemia instar II <b>first</b> feeding <b>started</b> at 20 dph and the early-weaning diets (A or B) were administered at 25 dph. All protocols have received the late-weaning diet C only after the 50 th dph. The experiment lasted for 65 days. By the end of the experiment, early-weaning protocol A and late-weaning protocol CB had similar wet weights, but still lower to the wet weights recorded for the late-weaning protocol CA. These results cannot be explained solely by the nutritional profile of each weaning diet.
