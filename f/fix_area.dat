Mall opponent Bruce Broadley commented, [...] "Everything we said would happen happened. Go {{back and look at}} all the proposals and drawings. It's a vastly different mall that was built. It was sold as upscale. What they built is arguably one of the ugliest malls in America." [...] These complaints were detailed in the 2008 documentary Megamall. However, Clarkstown Town Board member Shirley Lasker, who opposed the mall, acknowledged in 2008 that their concerns over traffic did not materialize. Valenti explained that the $23 million spent to <b>fix</b> <b>area</b> roads and create the mall's own exit on the Thruway prevented the predicted traffic congestion. Columnist Greg Clary argues that aesthetics are subjective, that average homeowners' bills did not go down due to continued spending on the part of elected officials, and that while the downtowns were hurt by the mall, this is not unique to the area, and can be averted by town planners who represent some of the 20 million {{of the mall}}'s patrons.|$|E

(SET NET, teichi ami) {{is one of a}} fishing gear which operate based on schooling fish migration in coastal area, specially for pelagic fish. As a stationary fishing gear which catching principle are blocking of fish migration and the catching process that guidance schooling fish into trapped area causes set net technology implementation required a better {{understanding of}} fishing ground, behaviour of fishing target, and technology of fishing gear. Daily catch composition of set net consist of pelagic fish (8 - 15 species) as dominant catch, demersal fish (3 - 7 species), and others catch (2 - 6 species) with average of 385 kg in total/day. The variety of set net catch are indicated that existing and coming in of fish catch into the trapped net (chamber net) were affected by fish behavior response to the fishing gear performance, schooling fish migration pattern into coastal area, and oceanography factors during the fishing operation. Besides that, oceanography factors such as current direction (west and east), current speed (?? 5 - 20 cm/s), high of sea waves level (?? 100 - 1750 cm), and length of sea waves (?? 200 - 300 cm) significantly affect the geometry performance of fishing gear function on catch capacity in location of set net installation as a <b>fix</b> <b>area</b> of fishing ground.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of how {{throughput}} in a wireless network scales as the number of users grows. Following the model of Gupta and Kumar, we consider identical nodes placed in a <b>fixed</b> <b>area.</b> Pairs of transmitters and receivers wish to communicate but are subject to interference from other nodes. Throughput is measured in bit-meters per second. We provide a very elementary deterministic approach that gives achievability results in terms of three key properties of the node locations. As a special case, we obtain throughput for a general class of network configurations in a <b>fixed</b> <b>area.</b> Results for random node locations in a <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> can also be derived as special cases of the general result by verifying the growth rate of three parameters. For example, as a simple corollary of our result we obtain a stronger (almost sure) version of the log throughput for random node locations in a <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> obtained by Gupta and Kumar. Results for some other interesting non-independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) node distributions are also provided.

40|$|Summary: The {{properties}} of a variable area sampling technique, {{by which the}} observer varies the searchradius to obtain approximately a prescribed number of woody plants in each tier measured, were determined by (i) comparison of <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> and variable area sampling of a computer-mapped shrub population; (ii) comparison of results from <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> and variable area sampling of woody plants exceeding about 2 m height in a rata-kamahi forest; (iii) two variable area surveys of woody plants exceeding 30 cm height in a beech forest. Variable area sampling gave unbiased estimates of crown area and plant density in the computer-mapped population. These were as precise as estimates obtained by <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> sampling when sampling intensities were equal. For {{the same number of}} plots, 20 m x 20 m <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> sampling of density and basal area in rata-kamahi forest was more precise than variable area sampling in plots containing 30 stems per plot, but in terms of sampling intensity and time, variable area sampling was more efficient. Both sampling methods gave similar stem diameter frequency patterns. Two surveys of beech forest, conducted 11 years apart, showed that with about 70 - 80 single-tier plots, differences in basal area of about 15 % can be detected using the variable area plot method. Variable area sampling is robust and suitable for ecological surveys of New Zealand's indigenous forests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Methods for wetland bioassessment using macroinvertebrates are {{not well}} developed. Two of the most {{controversial}} issues in stream bioassessment, subsampling and taxonomic resolution, have yet to be quantitatively addressed for wetlands. Using a multivariate approach, we evaluated the efficacy of family-, genus-, and species-level assemblage data in reflecting the environment and distinguishing impaired sites from the reference condition. We used 5 basic levels of subsampling (100 -, 200 -, and 300 -organism fixed counts; 10 % and 25 % <b>fixed</b> <b>areas),</b> an integrated subsample requiring a minimum fixed count and <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> (100 & 10 %), and 100 -count and 10 %-area subsamples coupled with a supplementary large-rare (LR) search. Data were obtained from 1. 5 -m 2 composite samples collected from 126 plots along a 10 -km-long eutrophication gradient in the Florida Ever-glades. Our results suggest that effectiveness of subsampling depended more upon the minimum number of individuals retained than minimum area or proportion of the sample picked. Fixed-area subsamples were generally less efficient than fixed counts, with 200 - and 300 -individual fixed counts resulting in significantly greater assemblage–environment relationships and much higher accuracy in detecting impairment than 10 % <b>fixed</b> <b>area,</b> despite averaging similar numbers of individuals.

30|$|A {{qualitative}} {{description of}} the control and optimization of ohmic loss is worth reviewing here. On an electrode/electrolyte layer with a <b>fixed</b> <b>area,</b> using small current collectors can expose a larger membrane area to reactant gases, therefore extracting greater current from the electrochemical reaction. However, a smaller current collector has a small contact area to electrodes and also makes the pathway for current conducting along the in-plane direction of electrode layers longer. This increases the ohmic loss. To strike the best balance between the two competing effects, an optimal arrangement of the current collectors on a bipolar plate is needed. This raises issues about optimization {{of the size of}} a current collector and the area from which the current due to electrochemical reaction is collected [11, 12]. Obviously, the objective of this optimization is to obtain a maximum power density on an electrode/electrolyte membrane in a <b>fixed</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{increased}} {{volume of}} seepage interconnected pores in mercury-displaced rock {{can be seen}} as the increased tortuosity in a single capillary model. Whereas, the flowing radius and thickness of adhesive layer determine the porosity variation coefficient ξ_a in a constant-radius percolating tube. And the flowing radius is seriously influenced by the fluid viscosity and relative motion of solid–fluid phase (Wei 2010; Antara and Demiray 2000). Thereby, ξ_a can be expressed as a function of U - u and η. According to the Prandtl’s adhesion layer theory, it is assumed that the flow outside the narrow region adjacent to the <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> boundary is reckoned as an ideal fluid flow, whereas the viscous force dominates the flow inside the narrow area adjacent to the <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> boundary. Towards the fluid of high viscosity, the impact of slip effect between solid–fluid under vibration on porosity variation cannot be neglected, with the decrease of fluid shear force and adhesive layer thickness.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAgroforestry {{systems have}} been {{recognized}} as areas with high conservation potential, {{and there is a}} need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the <b>fixed</b> <b>area</b> square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12 % at low density, variable area transect 9 – 12 % at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (− 5 to − 7 % at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed...|$|R
