5000|$|I think a {{huge part}} of me must be from Japan and it plays into my work, with light and dark. Like light and shadows or seeing and not seeing. In fact most of my work what that’s all about - the idea that {{darkness}}, the revered beauty of shadows, is not really “just” <b>dark</b> <b>emptiness,</b> but that darkness is actually very much alive, dynamic. So it’s about that reciprocity where darkness only exists where there’s light and light only exists where there’s darkness—they exist in tandem with one another, they define one another much more than being distant opposites.|$|R

Behind the soft, grey ridge of the nearest range the further mountains stood golden and pale grey, the snow all radiant like pure, soft gold. So still, gleaming in the sky, fashioned pure out of the ore of the sky, they shone in their silence. He stood and looked at them, his face illuminated. And like the golden, lustrous gleaming of the snow he felt his own thirst bright in him. He stood and gazed, leaning against a tree. And then everything slid away into space.|$|R

The morphological characteristics {{are similar to those of}} the shear joints in the terrestrial rocks. Shear fissures are not generated by the force of impact but by the tectonism.
