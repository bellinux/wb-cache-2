30|$|In recent years, the {{increasing}} demand for efficient indoor coverage coupled {{with the need for}} high data rates and quality of service (QoS) has highlighted the inflexibilities of the so-called traditional macrocell layer of a cellular network, calling for new indoor coverage/capacity management solutions. In response to this problem, the use of femtocell access points or <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> [1] has been proposed. Femtocell networks are created by low-power, low-cost, user-deployed <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> that are able of providing high-quality cellular service in residential or enterprise environments while operating in licensed spectrum.|$|R
30|$|Another {{practical}} motivation {{comes from}} the recent interests in femtocell networks, in which consumers can install <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> (BSs) for better indoor wireless voice and data communications [3]. However, an EU in femtocell networks tends to suffer from low throughput due to the limited capacity of backhaul connection to legacy cellular networks. Therefore, allowing the EUs to simultaneously access different home BSs in femtocell networks becomes a natural solution to aggregate sum rates of different backhaul links and thus avoid traffic bottleneck [4]. For simplicity, we also refer to this multiple home BSs access scheme in femtocell networks as multi-AP based scheme.|$|R

Femtocell access points (FAPs), also popularly known as <b>Home</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Stations,</b> are small <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> for use within indoor environments to improve coverage and capacity. FAPs have a limited range (e. g. limited to a home or office area) but offer immense capacity improvements for the network due {{to the ability to}} reuse a frequency more often as a result of smaller coverage areas. Because there may be thousands of these devices and since the nature of deployment is adhoc, it may not be possible to carry out elaborate frequency planning like that in the traditional cellular network. This paper aims to outline the radio resource management considerations within the context of femto cells, the broader objective being to initiate a discussion and encourage research in the areas highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{surest way to}} {{increase}} the system capacity of a wireless link is by getting the transmitter and receiver closer to each other, which creates the dual benefits of higher-quality links and more spatial reuse. In a network with nomadic users, this inevitably involves deploying more infrastructure, typically {{in the form of}} microcells, hot spots, distributed antennas, or relays. A less expensive alternative is the recent concept of femtocells also called <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> which are data access points installed by home users to get better indoor voice and data coverage. Femtocells expand the coverage of cellular networks, provide high data rate for users, decrease the transmission power of user equipments, and increase the spectrum efficiency. In this article, we will explore different characteristics of femtocell networks such as power control schemes, interference avoidance, capacity-coverage analysis, energy-efficiency and access control strategies.

30|$|In a {{situation}} where a mobile device within an area marked as an intersection of two base stations, it is becomes necessary to identify the particular base station to which the mobile device needs to connect. To arrive at a solution, we have identified two network factors comprising utility factor and signal strength for a given base station in that particular area.

40|$|In {{ubiquitous}} home networks, sensors collect various {{home environment}} {{data in the}} home. Since the sensor nodes are equipped with small, often irreplaceable, batteries with limited power capacity, {{it is essential that}} the network be energy-efficient in order to maximize the lifetime and to minimize the hop count. However, since the use of sensors embedded in consumer electronics devices is increasing, we consider two types of sensor nodes, the Wireless Sensor Node type, where the distance between the sensor nodes is limited by their transmission range and the Wireless Embedded Sensor Node(WEN) type, where the distance between the sensor nodes can be much longer. In this paper, we present a new sensor routing scheme that provides power-centric data delivery from sensors to the <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> The proposed scheme divides the home into areas such as rooms and deploys relay nodes to each area. The WENs collect data from the sensors and deliver the data only to the <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> Sensors deliver their data to the relay nodes or the <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> through the sensor with the strongest power. The performance results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient in wireless home networks than existing schemes [...] 1. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the typical}} urban {{scenario}} without femtocells, indoor users will be anyway {{served by the}} macrocell suffering for low channel quality due to the strong influence of wall attenuation. Introducing femtocells inside the buildings, indoor users will experience significant increase in terms of throughput. Performance of outdoor users, on the other hand, should not take any advantage in terms of experienced SINR. In fact, when <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and eNBs share the same bandwidth, outdoor users located nearby the building will sense high level of interference with consequent performance losses. Nevertheless, Figure 8 demonstrates that performance of outdoor users improve as well. This apparently counter intuitive result is mainly due to the macrocell unloading effect contributed {{by the introduction of}} femtocells (see Section 2.). In other words, a certain number of users is served by HeNBs and the amount of resources available for remaining outdoor users consequently increases.|$|R
30|$|Following these macro-only topologies, {{research}} {{turned to}} heterogeneous networks (HetNets) {{as a way}} to meet the increasing capacity demands in LTE-A networks. HetNets comprise a mixture of macro cells and low-power nodes known as small cells. These topologies face a challenging interference problem in cases where the macro and the small cells utilize the same carrier due to the difference in transmission power. Therefore, this inter-layer interference {{has been the focus of}} many studies [7 - 9]. The current trend is pointing to dedicated deployments with higher frequency bands [10] and thus shifting the focus towards intra-layer interference between the same class of nodes. Most of the research on intra-layer interference between small cells in the literature has considered femto cells (<b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations),</b> which present a high risk for inter-cell interference as the nodes are commonly installed by the users, making up an unplanned network [11, 12].|$|R
30|$|In general, each {{apartment}} contains {{up to one}} active femtocell, i.e., {{an active}} HeNB is working in the femtocell. This means that, for instance, a 5 × 5 grid building can contain up to 25 femtocells. The presence of an active femtocell in a single apartment can be randomly decided through the definition of an activity ratio[34], that is the probability that an active <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is present in an apartment.|$|E

Femtocells Access Points (FAP) are low power, plug and play <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> which are designed to extend the cellular radio range in indoor environments where macrocell coverage is generally poor. They offer significant increases in data rates over a short range, enabling high speed wireless and mobile broadband services, with the femtocell network overlaid onto the macrocell in a dual-tier arrangement. In contrast to conventional cellular systems which are well planned, FAP are arbitrarily installed by the end users and this can create harmful interference to both collocated femtocell and macrocell users. The interference becomes particularly serious in high FAP density scenarios and compromises the ensuing data rate. Consequently, effective management of both cross and co-tier interference is a major design challenge in dual-tier networks...|$|R

Mobile@Home is a fixed-mobile convergence concept using the fixed network to carry present and future mobile services (e. g. voice, video, mail and Internet access) {{all the way to the}} home or office. By combining the high bandwidth of the fixed access network with the wireless technology of Bluetooth, Mobile@Home makes it possible to deliver high bandwidth to the mobile phone. Mobile@Home requires a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone and a Bluetooth enabled HBS (<b>Home</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Station),</b> placed at the home or office.

The purpose of this thesis is the generation of simulated traffic between the HBS and HBSC and to analyze its behavior. This primary involves generation of signaling through an internal protocol, provided by Ericsson, for management and call control, and generation of GSM EFR (Enhanced Full Rate) voice streams over the RTP (Real Time Protocol) protocol. The simulation will consist of both the HBS and MS (Mobile Station). A set of HBS: s with attached MS will call one another through the HBSC.

30|$|Recent {{surveys have}} shown that more than 2 / 3 of mobile traffic demand is {{originated}} at home or work, but {{nearly half of the}} houses and premises have poor indoor coverage[1, 2].

Femtocell access points (also known as home base stations) have been proposed as a solution for the provision of high coverage and capacity indoors. By definition, femtocells access points are low-power base stations using cellular technology in licensed frequency bands providing service indoors over internet-grade backhaul under operator management[3].

One of the major challenges for femtocell network is the access control. The hybrid access con-trol mechanism, as a tradeoff between open and closed scenario, is the most promising access mechanism from which both users and operators benefit. Femtocell user equipments (FUEs) select femtocell access points (FAPs) according to their reported channel information which FAPs confidently own, and selfish FAPs have incentive to report larger information to win greater opportunity to be selected. Considering the aforementioned truth-telling in access control issue, this paper proposes access control scheme for hybrid femtocell network based on Arrow-d’Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV) mechanism. Close form for the payment is given. Moreover, the access control scheme is nearly optimal performances with low computational complexity compared with the optimal access scheme.

40|$|Abstract—Femtocell {{access points}} are inexpensive, {{plug and play}} <b>home</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> {{designed}} to extend radio coverage and increase capacity within indoor environments. Their inherent uncoordinated and overlaid deployment however, means existing radio resource management (RRM) techniques are often inef-fectual. Recent advances in dynamic RRM have emphasised {{the need for more}} efficient resource management strategies. While centralised resource management offers improved coordination and operator control giving better interference management, it is not scalable for increasing nodes. Distributed management techniques in contrast, do afford scaled deployment, but at higher node densities incur performance degradation in both system throughput and link-quality because of poor coordination. The level of spectrum sharing mandated by macro-femto deployment also impacts on system throughput and is scenario dependant. This paper presents a new hybrid resource management algo-rithm(HRMA) for down-links in orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based systems, with the model analysed for a range of macro-femto deployment scenarios. HRMA employs a dynamic fractional frequency reuse scheme for macro-cell deploy-ment with frequency reuse defined for femto users depending on their location by making certain frequencies locally available based on macro-femto tier information sharing and efficient localised spectrum utilisation. Quantitative performance results confirm the efficacy of the HRMA strategy for various key system metrics including interference minimisation, outage probability and throughput...|$|R
