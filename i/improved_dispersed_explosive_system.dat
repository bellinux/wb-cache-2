30|$|In summary, CL- 20 -based {{composites}} with rGO and CNT {{did help}} {{to increase the}} thermal conductivity of the <b>explosive</b> <b>system.</b> The fitted formula and curve proved that the improvement of thermal conductivity has a great influence on {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>system,</b> and the impact sensitivity of the coated samples were effectively reduced due to the increase of thermal conductivity. In addition, the addition of carbon materials had little influence on the energy of the <b>explosive</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, there are still some shortcomings in this study, such as the effect of different ratios of rGO and CNT on the experimental results had not been considered, so this part will be further explored in the following work.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been considered}} regarding the feasibility of separable high <b>explosive</b> <b>systems</b> for possible application in the Super Safe Program (Ambassador). After a very brief and limited investigation we have categorized various systems and given examples. The two basic approaches in the Ambassador program appear to be: Movement of fissionable material, and movement of explosives. Since explosives are our business, we will comment only on the latter approach. Movement of the explosive could entail small amounts of HE, such as for a detonator, booster, or {{a portion of the}} main charge [...] These possibilities tend to beg the issue of true safety and dispersal. Movement of the entire main charge or of separate non HE components is certainly more desirable. Separable <b>explosive</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to enhance {{visualization}} of shock fronts associated with single explosive particle (diameter — 100 μm) detonation, a Fourier holographic recording technique has been developed which relies on film non-linearities to greatly increase phaseobject visibility. The driving force behind this work is the investigation of detonation dynamics in <b>dispersed</b> particle <b>explosives.</b> These explosives, used for mine neutralization, are comprised of a fine, solid particulate dust which is dispersed as a cloud in the atmosphere over a given area. When detonation is initiated in some portion of the cloud, the ensuing detonation wave propagates throughout the entire cloud and results in an explosion, generating a tremendous pressure which serves to destroy or render useless any land mines present. Understanding the mechanism by which individual particles interact to sustain detonation in these solid <b>dispersed</b> particle <b>explosives</b> has been the research goal, and has led directly {{to the development of}} several holographic techniques...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for performing parameter optimization of ignition and growth continuum models for high <b>explosive</b> <b>systems.</b> Continuum modeling of reactive flow in high <b>explosive</b> <b>systems</b> can yield highly accurate predictions of experimental observations. However, the numerical parameter optimization {{that is needed}} to establish these predictions generally requires many evaluations of a model, {{and in the case of}} continuum reactive flow models, each evaluation re-quires long run times. In terms of keeping the total number of function evalua-tions low, the variable metric sequential quadratic programming approach is at present the most efficient general nonlinear local optimization method available. In this investigation, the variable metric sequential quadratic programming code NLQPEB is coupled to the two-dimensional high rate continuum modeling pro-grams CALE and DYNA 2 D. An example parameter optimization of an ignition and growth model for the HMX-based high explosive PAX 2 A is presented. The optimization procedure adjusts the ignition and growth reaction rate model pa-rameters in order to locally minimize the difference between calculated and ex-perimental pressure histories from Manganin gauge experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fluctuations}} of either thermodynamic or environmental origin on ignition in <b>explosive</b> <b>systems</b> is analyzed, with {{special emphasis on}} thermal explosion. A simple model due to Semenov is first analyzed in the zero-dimensional approximation. It is shown that the ignition times exhibit a wide dispersion, which {{at the level of}} the probability distribution of temperature shows up as a transient bimodality. Next, an extension to a spatially distributed system is developed. It is shown that fluctuations induce unexpected symmetry-breaking phenomena, reflected by a considerable dispersion of the position of the first "hot spot" initiated in the system. © 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.
