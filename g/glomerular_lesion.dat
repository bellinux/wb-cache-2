40|$|Rejection of renal allografts in man {{and animals}} is most {{frequently}} induced by cell-mediated immunity, the morphologic hallmark {{of which is}} the infiltration of the graft by mononuclear cells. In some presensitized recipients rejection may be mediated by humoral transplantation antibodies, and this is characterized clinically by a rapid tempo of rejection and morphologically by accumulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and renal cortical necrosis. In recipients treated with immunosuppressive drugs, most renal allografts function well for over 1 yr. However, late deterioration is observed in many grafts. This may take the form of proliferative glomerulonephritis with accumulation of immunoglobulin and complement along glomerular basement membranes. This <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion</b> of the graft may be of immunologic nature without being rejection. In many instances the <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion</b> may be due to recurrence of the original disease of the recipient. In other instances it may represent a de novo immunologic process induced by the response to antigens shared by the graft and recipient as evidenced by animal experiments. The <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion</b> in the graft may also be caused by humoral transplantation antibodies. Therefore, the final outcome of the renal transplantation may to a great extent depend on the strength of transplantation antibody response, being more favorable for low than high responders...|$|E

We previously established a nephritogenic IgG 3 -producing hybridoma clone, B 1, from an MRL/lpr mouse, which induces only a ‘wire loop-like’ type of <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion</b> when injected into SCID mice. Injection of SCID mice with an anti-trinitrophenyl IgM antibody-producing hybridoma clone, Sp 6, following injection of the B 1 clone, however, resulted {{in the development of a}} ‘cell-proliferative’ type of <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion,</b> associated with an accumulation of both antibodies in glomeruli.

Recently, nephrin has been focused in a number of studies of proteinuria development including various types of acquired glomerular diseases including minimal change nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy. However, the precise role of nephrin in such acquired glomerular diseases is still unknown. To analyse the role of nephrin further, two kinds of anti-nephrin antibodies were raised in the rabbits and applied to an experimental mouse model of chronic graft-versus-host disease, in which (C 57 BL/ 10 × DBA/ 2) F 1 mice developed clinically apparent severe proteinuria with significant glomerular lesions 7 weeks after parental DBA/ 2 cell transfer. Antibody-sandwich ELISA detected anti-nephrin antibodies during week 2 to week 6, with the peak at week 2 or week 4.

It occurs almost immediately in direct toxic injury, but there is a latent period of weeks to months with immunologically mediated processes. Of the two mechanisms, the second is by far the more common in clinical settings. The best studied experimental agent causing direct toxic injury is the aminonucleoside ofpuromycin.

Electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} cellular proliferation is mesangial in origin and that there are qualitative and quantitative alterations in the filtration basement membrane. In addition there are numerous examples of direct contact between filtration basement membrane and neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This latter phenomenon is good direct evidence that interaction of glomerular-bound antigen-antibody complex and complement has taken place. The light and electron microscopic evidence is thus in favour of the histopathological entity, mixed membranous and proliferative glomerulonephritis, being fundamentally a proliferative <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesion</b> initiated by complement-induced basement membrane injury...|$|E
40|$|ACE {{inhibition}} reduces proteinuria, <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> and {{extracellular matrix}} production in a normotensive rat model of immune complex nephritis. We studied {{the effect of}} the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril, on the clinical and morphological lesions of a normotensive model of immune complex nephritis. Untreated rats developed massive nephrotic syndrome, intense cell proliferation and <b>glomerular</b> and tubulointerstitial <b>lesions.</b> In the renal cortex of nephritic rats there was a significant increase in gene expression of TGF-β 1, fibronectin and collagens, and ACE activity. Systolic blood pressure remained normal with progression of the disease. Administration of quinapril for three weeks to animals with <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> (proteinuria 20 to 50 mg/day) avoided the development of intense proteinuria (79 ± 28 vs. 589 ± 73 mg/day, P < 0. 001) and decreased cell proliferation, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial lesions, and inflammatory infiltrates. Cortical gene expression of TGF-β 1 and matrix proteins was also diminished. ACE activity was inhibited by 68 % in renal cortex. These results show that quinapril administration to normotensive rats with immune complex nephritis decreases proteinuria and <b>glomerular</b> and tubulointerstitial <b>lesions,</b> probably modulating the local angiotensin II generation and its effects on cell growth, TGF-β and matrix protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} tubulointerstitial lesions in diabetic nephropathy, we studied the renal histological findings and various functional parameters in 201 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The patients were divided into four groups according to {{the severity of the}} tubulointerstitial lesions on a scale of T 0 through TⅢ. Diffuse <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> were graded by Gellman's criteria (D 0 through DⅣ). There was a weak correlation between the severity of <b>glomerular</b> diffuse <b>lesions</b> and that of tubulointerstitial lesions; discordance between <b>glomerular</b> and tubulointerstitial <b>lesions</b> was presest in 37 patients (18 %). Urinary excretion of β₂ MG and NAG significantly increased with the severity of tubulointerstitial lesions, whereas the creatinine clearance decreased. Multiple regression analysis showed that <b>glomerular</b> and tubulbinterstitial <b>lesions</b> independently contribute to the decline of the glomerular filtration rate. These results suggest that tubulointerstitial lesions are involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr(MRL/lpr) lupus mice develop {{glomerulonephritis}} {{in which}} the histopathological manifestations of the disease are characterized by diffuse cell-proliferative, crescentic, and/or wire loop-like lesions, resembling those of human lupus nephritis. Although these lesions {{are thought to be}} mediated by antibodies, little data is available to explain these regular variations in <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> induced by antibodies at the monoclonal level. We studied <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> of normal or severe combined immunodeficient mice injected with nephritogenic immunoglobulin G 3 -producing hybridoma clones (2 B 11. 3 and 7 B 6. 8), which we previously established from an unmanipulated MRL/lpr mouse. Both clones caused increased serum levels of immunoglobulin G 3 with identical patterns over time and both induced glomerular deposits of immunoglobulin G 3 and C 3. However, 2 B 11. 3 and 7 B 6. 8 induced <b>glomerular</b> <b>lesions</b> that differed in their histopathological manifestations. The 2 B 11. 3 clone generated cell-proliferative lesions associated with marked Mac- 2 -positive macrophage infiltrates, but the 7 B 6. 8 clone induced lesions characterized by subendothelial hyaline deposits resembling wire loops. The latter was not associated with significant inflammatory cell infiltrates at any point throughout the progression of the lesion. Thus, our findings suggest that the histopathological variation in glomerulonephritis seen in MRL/lpr mice results from clonally expanded B cell clones that produce nephritogenic antibodies with different pathogenic potencies...|$|R
