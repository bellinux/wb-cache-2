50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>trevally,</b> Lactarius lactarius, is {{species of}} fish in the family Lactariidae, {{currently}} the sole member of the family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>trevally</b> is {{native to}} the Indian Ocean and from East Africa to Southeast Asia, and in the western Pacific Ocean from Japan to Queensland, Australia. It is a coastal species, {{occurring}} in marine and brackish waters at depths of from 15 to 100 m. It is an important species to local commercial fisheries.|$|E
40|$|The whitefish, Lactarius lactarius, {{which is}} the only species in the Family Lactariidae has {{distribution}} all along the Indian coast. Though small in size, attaining a maximum of 330 mm, it fetches good price due to its good taste and consumer preference. It is also called <b>false</b> <b>trevally</b> and bigjawed jumper and is called katali in Gujarat, saundala in Maharashtra, adameenu in Karnataka, parava or adavu in Kerala, kuthippu or suthumbu in Tamil Nadu and sating in West Bengal. In recent years, the whitefish has caught the special attention of fishery biologists and conservationists since its landings has greatly decreased...|$|E

50|$|The island trevally, island jack, thicklip <b>trevally,</b> or <b>false</b> bluefin <b>trevally,</b> Carangoides orthogrammus, is a {{widespread}} species of offshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The island trevally is common through the tropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from Mozambique and the Seychelles {{in the west to}} Hawaii and the Revillagigedo Islands in the central and eastern Pacific. The species is almost completely absent from the continental shelves, instead inhabiting offshore islands, where it is found in lagoons and on reef systems. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 75 cm and 6.6 kg in weight, and is distinguishable by its angular snout and yellow spots, as well as more detailed anatomical features. The island trevally often moves in small schools, preying on a variety of small fishes and crustaceans. It is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range, often taken by trawls, hook-and-line, and various inshore netting methods, and is sold fresh or salted at market.|$|R
40|$|Lactarius lactarius, {{commonly}} known as <b>false</b> <b>trevally</b> is exploited mainly by trawlers from the inshore waters (5 - 30 m depth) along the Karnataka coast. Bottom-set gillnets and purseseines also land minor quantities of whitefish, besides the indigenous gears operated during monsoon. The average annual production of false travelly from multiday trawls operated along Mangalore coast remained at 416 t {{during the period from}} 2000 to 2002. A declining trend in the fishery was noticed since the year 2000 consequent to reduction in catch rates and the production reached an all-time low of 117 t in 2004. Thereafter, the catch rates in multiday trawl improved significantly from 0. 09 kgh– 1 in 2004 to an annual average of 0. 33 kgh– 1 in 2008 (Fig. 1). During the year, 50...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of the <b>false</b> <b>trevally</b> (Lactarius lactarius), 127 to 221 mm {{in total}} length, were studied for {{the mode of}} {{anchorage}} of the air-bladder with the interspinous bone of the anal fin. The 1 st and 2 nd interspinous bones are fused together into a single piece (named here as the anchor bone) which pierces through the air-bladder, dividing it into two intercommunicating chambers at its upper end, and ultimately articulates with the 10 th vertebral bone. The {{lower end of the}} bone is broad, fan like with one side affording articulation with the 1 st and 2 nd anal spines. This is an unique feature of great taxonomical importance to L. lactarius, the only species in the family Lactariidae. The anal fin counts (23 - 27) and vertebral counts (23) are also given...|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the American ichthyologists Jordan and Gilbert in 1881 based on a specimen taken from the Revillagigedo Islands, which was designated to be the holotype. They named this new species Caranx orthogrammus, placing the species in a closely related genus of jacks, but this was later changed to Carangoides after further revision of the family had occurred. The species was independently redescribed a number of times, with the fish placed in subspecies status twice. John Treadwell Nichols considered his C. ferdau jordani to be separate from C. orthogrammus, or possibly a subspecies of the blue trevally, C. ferdau, and was later treansferred to C. jordani. It was also considered a subspecies or a synonym of the bludger, C. gymnostethoides, and was also renamed as C. nitidus. The fish is now considered a separate species, with the subspecies names and the later names rendered invalid under the ICZN naming rules. The species {{is commonly known as}} island trevally in reference to its preferred offshore habitat, with the names thicklip <b>trevally</b> and <b>false</b> bluefin <b>trevally</b> also used as descriptive names. The specific epithet means [...] "straight lined" [...] in Greek.|$|R
30|$|For n- 3 and n- 6 PUFAs, {{the highest}} content {{was found for}} Atlantic salmon and grey mullet {{at the level of}} 2, 900 and 1, 980  mg per 100  g, respectively. Regarding EPA, DHA, and DPA, fatty acids that need to be intake from food, the total amount varied from 31.3 to 2, 510  mg per 100  g. No matter whether the {{individual}} or sum of these n- 3 fatty acids is concerned, the highest amount was found in Atlantic salmon. While Japanese eel, laced moray, grunt, yellow croaker, silver pomfret, <b>false</b> halibut, white <b>trevally,</b> purple amberjack, and yellowtail kingfish from region B were also found to contain more than 1, 000  mg per 100  g of these n- 3 fatty acids. Hence, the choice for fishes rich in these n- 3 fatty acids is not limited.|$|R
