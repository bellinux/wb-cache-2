Second, national and international legislations and regulations in relation to <b>isolation</b> <b>wards</b> as well as case studies on developed nations were investigated in order to identify the problems in <b>isolation</b> <b>wards</b> in Korea and improvement plans.

500|$|Conteh {{now found}} himself {{in the middle of a}} war zone, {{starving}} and homeless. He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because [...] "they had no one to help them". Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever <b>isolation</b> <b>ward</b> in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post. It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching Lassa fever. When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.|$|E

2500|$|Matters {{reached a}} {{breaking}} point in late November. [...] While the national epidemic had already peaked, St. Mary's endured a terrible day. [...] In the 24-hour period ending {{at the dawn}} of 24 November, seven patients died, three of which were health workers. [...] Two of these were nurses who did not work in the <b>isolation</b> <b>ward.</b> [...] The thought of infections being passed to health workers who did not directly care for Ebola patients panicked many and the nurses mutinied. [...] The day-shift did not go to work; instead 400 health workers, nearly the entire staff of St. Mary's, gathered in the assembly hall of the nursing school. [...] When Lukwiya rushed down to ask what they wanted, at least one nurse yelled that the hospital should be closed. [...] Lukwiya silenced the nurses, most of whom he had trained himself, by stating that if the hospital closed he would leave Gulu and never return. [...] He then spoke on how he had let himself be abducted by the rebels rather than risk St. Mary's and that they would be responsible for the deaths that would result if the hospital closed. [...] After hours of contentious discussion that extended into the afternoon, Lukwiya switched back to a conciliatory approach, stating that he would remain no matter if everyone left. [...] The meeting ended with him and the nurses singing a song together; he had prevailed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the <b>isolation</b> <b>ward,</b> Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the evidence for}} the effectiveness of isolation measures in reducing the incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation and infection in hospital inpatients. DESIGN: Systematic review of published articles. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), and citation lists (1966 - 2000). REVIEW METHODS: Articles reporting MRSA related outcomes and describing an isolation policy were selected. No quality restrictions were imposed on studies using <b>isolation</b> <b>wards</b> or nurse cohorting. Other studies were included if they were prospective or employed planned comparisons of retrospective data. RESULTS: 46 studies were accepted; 18 used <b>isolation</b> <b>wards,</b> nine used nurse cohorting, and 19 used other isolation policies. Most were interrupted time series, with few planned formal prospective studies. All but one reported multiple interventions. Consideration of potential confounders, measures to prevent bias, and appropriate statistical analysis were mostly lacking. No conclusions could be drawn in a third of studies. Most others provided evidence consistent with a reduction of MRSA acquisition. Six long interrupted time series provided the strongest evidence. Four of these provided evidence that intensive control measures including patient isolation were effective in controlling MRSA. In two others, <b>isolation</b> <b>wards</b> failed to prevent endemic MRSA. CONCLUSION: Major methodological weaknesses and inadequate reporting in published research mean that many plausible alternative explanations for reductions in MRSA acquisition associated with interventions cannot be excluded. No well designed studies exist that allow the role of isolation measures alone to be assessed. None the less, {{there is evidence that}} concerted efforts that include isolation can reduce MRSA even in endemic settings. Current isolation measures recommended in national guidelines should continue to be applied until further research establishes otherwise...|$|R
