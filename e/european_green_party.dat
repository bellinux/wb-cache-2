However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

By {{the end of the year}} Wootton had employed graphic designer Jim Killock to unify the words <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> and Real Progress in a single [...] "badge" [...] and the [...] "lozenge" [...] was born, inspired as a homage to the <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party's</b> [...] "rhomb" [...] which Wootton and Killock considered clunky (see Wootton's homepage).|$|R

25|$|Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, {{there have}} emerged {{allegations}} {{that after the}} outbreak of the Somali Civil War in late 1991, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste that was illegally dumped in Somali waters by several European firms – front companies created by the Italian mafia. The <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the European Parliament in Strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two European companies—the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian waste broker, Progresso—and representatives of the warlords then in power, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million). According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment mission, there are far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of Hobbio and Benadir on the Indian Ocean coast—diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP continues that the current situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} Dutch environmentalists led by Marten Bierman founded The Greens on December 17, 1983.

5000|$|Vihreät is {{no longer}} a protest party, nor an {{alternative}} movement. Some Green candidates in the elections reject classification as [...] "left" [...] or [...] "right".

5000|$|While on {{many issues}} <b>European</b> <b>Greens</b> {{practice}} the same policies, one issue divides <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> parties: the <b>European</b> Union. Some <b>Green</b> <b>parties,</b> like the Dutch GreenLeft, [...] the <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> of England and Wales, the Swiss <b>Green</b> <b>Party,</b> the Irish <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> and the German Alliance '90/The Greens, are pro-European while some, like the <b>Green</b> <b>party</b> in Sweden, are moderately eurosceptic.|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties fielded [...] "candidates" [...] for president of the Commission, the so-called Spitzenkandidaten (German, [...] "leading candidate). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful [...] "candidate". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called Spitzenkandidaten were [...] Jean-Claude Juncker for the European People's Party, Martin Schulz for the Party of European Socialists, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and José Bové jointly for the <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2004, in {{the context}} of the {{preparation}} of his electoral campaign and in the wider context of the final governmental drafting of the text, he led the foundation of the <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> in Rome. Fischer had directly participated to the drafting as German minister of foreign affairs, he was considered one of the candidates for the new role of [...] "European minister of Foreign Affairs" [...] evoked in the text, and his speech was the keynote of the event. Cohn-Bendit described the <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Party</b> as the first stone of European citizenship, but other commentators described this new structure as a mere adaptation of the former Federation of European Green Parties. Just as in the former structure, only delegates from national parties were allowed to vote, individual supporters were only entitled to receive information, and all other federations of European parties had to adapt their statuses later in 2004 to the new regulations from the European Commission about European political parties, in order to continue receive public funding. However, Cohn-Bendit as usual was early and energetic in presenting this innovation to the media.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} possible {{links between the}} organisational ‘transformation’ of Western <b>European</b> <b>Green</b> <b>parties,</b> on the one hand, and the recent access to national coalition government {{of some of these}} parties in five countries, on the other hand. First of all, some comparative lessons are drawn from an examination of the “lifespan” of <b>Green</b> <b>parties</b> since their creation. Secondly, a series of hypotheses with regards to the possible causal link between organisational change and access to power are examined. Thirdly, the reverse question is addressed, that of the potential impact of governmental participation on further organisational change. Finally, although some provisional conclusions have been reached with regards to some of the potential (causal) links, complementary paths for more focused and qualitative studies are put forward...|$|R
