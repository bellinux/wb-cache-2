50|$|The Group's {{founder and}} former Honorary President Luigi Lucchini {{expanded}} and developed his father's business of crafting iron at Casto, Italy {{by building a}} small rolling mill to produce rebar during the period after World War II. Over the years, the craftsmanship was replaced by industry, investing {{in more and more}} productive rolling mills and building the first electric arc furnaces to melt scrap and transform it into steel <b>ingots,</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>rolling.</b> During this period Lucchini played a role within the Italian steel industry making a name for itself through unyielding determination. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lucchini Group forecasted market evolution and progressively widened its product range to include added value products through investment and acquisition. Through privatization, the group entered the integral cycle technology, widened its product range, invested its resources in R&D sector, set an increasing attention onto customer service and developed the internationalization process. In 2005, following a financial restructuring due to important investments in the plants, the majority of Lucchini Group was acquired by the Russian group Severstal, through a capital increase.|$|R
40|$|During {{the heating}} <b>for</b> <b>rolling,</b> <b>ingots</b> and billets are {{affected}} by the chemical action of the heating atmosphere. Between the heating environment elements and steel components there are taking place chemical reactions initiated at the separation surface that may affect a layer in metal of about a few microns to a few millimeters. The thickness of the affected layer {{is a function of the}} environment nature, heated material composition, chemical reaction’s type and kinetics, heating rate and temperature. The aim of this paper is to correlate the oxidation and the decarburization processes during the heating of <b>ingots</b> and billets <b>for</b> <b>rolling.</b> The study was made on ingots and billets rolled at the breakdown mill of the Special Steel Complex, Physics Laboratories from MECHEL Targoviste, Romania. The scope of the study is the analysis of the scale obtained from the rolling mill train in order to obtain specific information that will be used in adjusting the <b>rolling</b> parameters <b>for</b> diminishing the oxidation and decarburization and for recycling the scale in electric furnaces...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} research results concerning designation {{of the scope}} of segregation of elements by analysing the <b>ingot,</b> designated <b>for</b> hot <b>rolling</b> of long products. The research tests were performed under industrial conditions, during continuous casting production cycle of high carbon steels. From cc ingots with square cross-section of 160 mm samples having the length of 400 mm were collected, out of which two samples were cut up, the so-called templates with the thickness of 20 mm. Segregation of elements was determined based on the quantitative analysis of results performed by using spark spectrometry pursuant to PN-H- 04045. Changes in concentrations of elements were analysed along the line, which join the opposite sides of the sample in their half length and pass through the geometric centre of the square cross-section. In the further course of the research study, there was also determined the segregation along perpendicular line up to the surface connecting the core of the cross-section with lateral plane. Designations of element contents were performed at points distanced from each other by approx. 10 mm and situated on the lines. There was found segregation of carbon, sulphur and phosphorus...|$|R

40|$|Rolling bearing faults {{often lead}} to {{electromechanical}} system failure due to its high speed and complex working conditions. Recently, {{a large amount of}} fault diagnosis studies <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> bearing based on vibration data has been reported. However, few studies have focused on fault diagnosis <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> bearings under variable conditions. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on image recognition <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> bearings to realize fault classification under variable working conditions. The proposed method includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal data are transformed into a two-dimensional image based on recurrence plot (RP) technique. Next, a popular feature extraction method which has been widely used in the image field, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), is employed to extract fault features from the two-dimensional RP and subsequently generate a 128 -dimensional feature vector. Third, due to the redundancy of the high-dimensional feature, kernel principal component analysis is utilized to reduce the feature dimensionality. Finally, a neural network classifier trained by probabilistic neural network is used to perform fault diagnosis. Verification experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> bearings under variable conditions, thereby providing a promising approach to fault diagnosis <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> bearings...|$|R
