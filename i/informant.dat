5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an <b>informant,</b> {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the <b>informant</b> by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the <b>informant</b> by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the <b>informant.</b>|$|E

In such cases, it is necessary to interview multiple <b>informants</b> and combine the data.

40|$|Courts treat self-incriminating {{statements}} by criminal <b>informants</b> {{as a significant}} factor favoring {{the reliability of the}} <b>informant’s</b> information when making probable cause determinations for the issuance of search warrants. Courts do so even though admissions of criminal activity usually undercut, rather than support, credibility. In using self-incriminating statements to support the <b>informant’s</b> reliability, courts tend to rely on a theory with significant theoretical flaws. Furthermore, recent United States Supreme Court jurisprudence in other contexts undercuts the reliability of using self-incriminating statements to support the veracity of other information. If courts adequately scrutinize the <b>informant’s</b> self-incriminating statements and the circumstances surrounding the making of those statements, however, these statements can be used to support the <b>informant’s</b> veracity in limited circumstances. This article therefore proposes an analytical framework courts can use to assess more accurately when an <b>informant’s</b> self-incriminating statements should support the <b>informant’s</b> veracity. The test proposed here is sufficiently flexible to allow the courts and police to consider the facts and circumstances of each case, but it will provide some guidance to courts and officers that will help protect the public from some of the abuses that can come with over-reliance on criminal <b>informants...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to knowledge about how flute teachers construct gender in relation to their choices of teaching content for students between 15 to 18 years old. The theoretical framework consists of gender theories which are derived from social constructionism. These gender theories accentuates that gender and sex are socially constructed. Four flute teachers were interviewed at two different times each. The focus of the interviews were on a stimulant material consisting of examples from the <b>informants</b> teaching content. The interviews’ were transcribed and analysed by means of a division between how the <b>informants</b> spoke (the language) and what the <b>informants</b> spoke about (the content). The result of how the <b>informants</b> speak shows that the <b>informants</b> are reproducing traditional gender patterns through the language by addressing women and men with different characteristics. The result of what the <b>informants</b> speak about shows that most of the <b>informants</b> are of the opinion that the most important thing with teaching is non musical values. The <b>informants</b> are reproducing a teaching canon consisting mostly of classical music written by male composers. There are different ideas among the <b>informants</b> about how the teaching content shall be presented to the students. An overall conclusion is that this study confirms earlier research in this field regarding the division between feminine and masculine characteristics and the reproduction of a teaching canon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} knowledge about what the lives of the unemployed youth of immigrant background looks like, and what the views of the unemployed young people are about work and employment. The study is a qualitative study where the empirical material is based on interviews with seven unemployed immigrant youth between the ages of 19 and 25 years. A study where the central questions was to explore how the informants' living conditions and identity are affected by being unemployed. The other issues aimed at how <b>informants</b> background affected their ability to enter the labour market, and the job expectations the <b>informants</b> had about the future and the Swedish labour market. Empirin have been analyzed with regard to methodology tool based theory, as well as theoretical starting points, such as social capital, formal and informal channels, ethnicity and stigma theory. The result is shown in five different disciplines on the basis of <b>informants</b> experiences of the situation they are in. These topics are The unemployment and welfare, The social network's importance, The foreign name the obstacles, The road to the labour market and finally, The social environment. The results show that <b>informants</b> welfare was affected in a destructive way when <b>informants</b> experienced a lack of employment. <b>Informants</b> perceived that the social network's importance was very prominent in the labour market, which proved, however, that <b>informants</b> social networks were very limited and without a resource for them. The result also shows that the majority of <b>informants</b> had been discriminated against by employers. A crucial factor for this form of discrimination were <b>informants</b> background and the foreign name. Road to the labour market was perceived stressful when the economic situation in the country was unstable and in decline. The results suggest that the <b>informants</b> had to lower their job expectations when they could not change the situation. Moreover, it appeared to indicate that ambient performances that immigrant segregated areas are perceived as socially vulnerable, both as a social problem for society. <b>Informants</b> self-image was negatively affected by the social environment perceptions of immigrants segregated neighbourhoods, which were seen by <b>informants</b> as a contributing factor that made their job opportunities more difficult...|$|R

An important function of criminal justice systems is the evaluation of evidence presented in the court of law. Evidence from jailhouse <b>informants</b> who testify that they have been privy to confessions of crimes is a contentious issue. Much of the scholarly literature available to date on wrongful conviction cases focuses on causes of insufficient and unreliable evidence obtained through different techniques and from different sources. Despite the high number of investigations into wrongful conviction cases, the subject of jailhouse <b>informants</b> has not yet been thoroughly explored as a leading cause of wrongful convictions in Canada. The current study employed a qualitative methodology in analyzing reported criminal cases that have used jailhouse <b>informant’s</b> testimony in order to find parallels with respect to cases, <b>informants,</b> and testimonies. The findings center on the credibility of evidence, the trustworthiness of <b>informants,</b> judicial cautions and the consequences that followed the use of such evidence. While jailhouse <b>informants</b> have been identified as a cause of wrongful convictions, there have been few studies that provide insight into these cases in Canada.
