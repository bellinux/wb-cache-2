500|$|... "Cherish" [...] is a doo-wop style pop shuffle {{song and}} opened the second side of Like a Prayer. It begins {{with the sound of}} synths and {{keyboard}} and Madonna repeatedly singing the words [...] "cherish, cherish". This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always <b>having</b> <b>you</b> here by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet, So don't underestimate my point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Buzz {{magazine}} became bored of the repetitive {{nature of the}} storyline surrounding Mark trying to ask Kate out again. They said [...] "honestly, {{how many times have}} we been through this with these two?" [...] They later branded him [...] "one angry man" [...] during the police corruption storyline. They said he slept with Jade because [...] "too much stewing over work and not enough play makes Brennan a dull boy". TV Week described Mark's departure episode as [...] "edge-of-your-seat." [...] While a reporter for the Daily Record said [...] "Goodbye Brennan - we enjoyed <b>having</b> <b>you</b> and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." [...] Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Mark in her list of the [...] "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" [...] and she stated [...] "As Ramsay Street's resident hottie back in 2010, Scott McGregor graced Neighbours as the coolest kind of police investigator (he rode a motorbike). Unfortunately for us, Scott fled his neighbourly friends to flaunt his devilishly handsome face to the world as a model." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never <b>having</b> <b>you</b> do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for PopSugar Australia said [...] "We {{love it when}} our favourite, long-running TV soapies surprise us with something new and a little different." [...] Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun included the episode in his feature on the best television programs being broadcast on 22 June, saying [...] "Brooding cop Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) has 30 minutes to leave Erinsborough before the poop goes down with the dodgy police investigation that's been dragging on for months. Girlfriend Kate plans to leave with him, but her sister Sophie's not so keen on a life change." [...] Channel 5 included the episode in their [...] "Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011" [...] program, where it came second overall. A writer for the channel's website {{believed that it was}} clear from the start that Mark would be worthy of a memorable send-off, during a feature on the character's [...] "best bits". A writer for the Inside Soap Yearbook, which was published at the end of 2011, proclaimed the episode was one of [...] "The Best Bits of July". A {{reporter for}} the Daily Record stated [...] "Goodbye Brennan – we enjoyed <b>having</b> <b>you</b> and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the surrender, Sherman issued ten days' rations to {{the hungry}} Confederate soldiers, {{as well as}} horses and mules for them to [...] "insure a crop." [...] He also ordered {{distribution}} of corn, meal, and flour to civilians throughout the South. This {{was an act of}} generosity that Johnston would never forget; he wrote to Sherman that his attitude [...] "reconciles me to what I have previously regarded as the misfortune of my life, that of <b>having</b> <b>you</b> to encounter in the field." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been {{employing}} {{yourself in}} the meanwhile?' quoth Sir John, lazily crossing his legs. 'Where <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been? what harm <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been doing?' ...|$|R

2500|$|The club {{endured a}} poor first half {{to the season}} and languished in ninth {{position}} after a home defeat by West Ham in December 2001. On the night of Christmas Day, Ferguson shelved his retirement plan. His family convinced him to remain in charge of United; Cathy bluntly listed her reasoning: [...] "One, your health is good. Two, I'm not <b>having</b> <b>you</b> in the house. And three, you're too young anyway." [...] Ferguson informed Watkins of his u-turn the following day and resumed work at once.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that Zhu was an {{excellent}} speaker, but was not talented otherwise. [...] In 896, though, the imperial official He Ying (何迎) submitted a recommendation to Emperor Zhaozong, claiming that Zhu was as talented as the great Jin Dynasty prime minister Xie An. [...] The Taoist monk Xu Yanshi (許巖士), a close associate of Emperor Zhaozong's due to his medical abilities, also recommended Zhu, claiming that he had economic talent. [...] Emperor Zhaozong met with Zhu for several days straight and was impressed by Zhu's speaking ability.

2500|$|The speaker first reminds the Normans of the {{military}} prowess of their race (especially {{when compared to the}} Scots): [...] "Most illustrious nobles of England, Normans by birth, ... consider who you are, and against whom, and where it is, you are waging war; for then no one shall with impunity resist your prowess. Bold France, taught by experience, has quailed beneath your valour, fierce England, led captive, has submitted to you; rich Apulia, on <b>having</b> <b>you</b> for her masters, has flourished once again; Jerusalem so famed, and illustrious Antioch, have bowed themselves before you; and now Scotland, which of right is subject to you, attempts to show resistance, displaying a temerity not warranted by her arms, more fitted indeed for rioting than for battle. These are people, in fact, who have no knowledge of military matters, no skill in fighting, no moderation in ruling. There is no room then left for fear, but rather for shame, that those whom we have always sought on their own soil and overcome [...].have ...come flocking into our country." ...|$|E
