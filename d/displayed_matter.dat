50|$|Steavenson {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the NEIMME Council in 1867 aged thirty-one and in 1877 he was elected Vice-President of the NEIMME. During his time as Vice-President he visited parts of Spain which {{inspired}} his paper 'On the Value of Photography to Mining Engineers'. During his talk he exhibited the photographs he had taken in Bilbao. The exhibition consisted of images of ore being shipped in steamers and wire-rope tramways which also transported ore. He thought these were the most notable photographs as he believed the members had not witnessed the tramways in action before. He additionally exhibited photographs of the local history and culture as he displayed images of Burgos Cathedral as well as pictures of the homes which the local population lived in. The purpose of Steavenson's talk was to display to the engineers that photography was essential in not only gaining personal knowledge, but <b>displaying</b> <b>matters</b> of interest to others who could not see for themselves what was being photographed. He believed that photography was also useful to provide evidence for the future as mining techniques advanced and progressed. Steavenson was congratulated for his paper as the Institute's members complimented not only his mining intellect, but his evident ability as an excellent photographer. Steavenson recollected that his passion for photography had begun ten years prior as he recalls taking his first underground photographs of fungus growing at the Cleveland Mines. This later developed into taking photographs of tubs and mining machinery underground.|$|R

40|$|Is sexual {{orientation}} associated with structural {{differences in the}} brain? To address this question, 80 homosexual and heterosexual men and women (16 homosexual men and 15 homosexual women) underwent structural MRI. We used voxelbased morphometry to test for differences in grey matter concentration associated with gender and {{sexual orientation}}. Compared with heterosexual women, homosexual women <b>displayed</b> less grey <b>matter</b> bilaterally in the temporo-basal cortex, ventral cerebellum, and left ventral premotor cortex. The relative decrease in grey matter was most prominent in the left perirhinal cortex. The left perirhinal area also showed less grey matter in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women. Thus, in homosexual women, the perirhinal cortex grey <b>matter</b> <b>displayed</b> a more male-like structural pattern. This is in accordance with previous research that revealed signs of sex-atypical prenatal androgenization in homosexual women, but not in homosexual men.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to one month post-chemotherapy, fewer regions displayed reduced GM at one year post-treatment relative to baseline. Regions <b>displaying</b> persistent grey <b>matter</b> loss remained bilaterally distributed in frontotemporal regions. Enduring frontal grey matter suppression {{was found in}} the left anterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior frontal operculum, and right middle frontal gyrus, congruent with a previous report of chronic frontal insult in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients (McDonald et al. 2010). The region of the left superior temporal gyrus and left insula that had pronounced reduction at T 2 relative to T 1 (see Figure  1) did not fully resolve. The superior temporal gyrus and insula share efferent and afferent connections (Flynn 1999) and this may help explain the concomitant insults to these regions observed in the present study.
