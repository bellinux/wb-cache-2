40|$|Swine influenza, {{also called}} pig influenza, swine flu, <b>hog</b> <b>flu</b> and pig flu, is an {{infection}} by {{any one of}} several types of swine influenza virus. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or S-OIV (swine-origin influenza virus) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. In H 1 N 1, the ‘H’ refers to the hemagglutinin protein, and the ‘N’ refers to the neuraminidase protein. While at present the virus is causing a mild disease, the next wave may be more severe. Influenza is a simple virus, with just eight genes, but it makes poor copies of itself, leading to constant mutation. Influenza viruses are by nature unstable and unpredictable and have the unique capability of changing their antigenic characteristics by mutation. Occasionally, novel strains also emerge, often through re-assortment or exchange of genetic material among influenza viruses from different animal, human or bird sources. Such genetic restructuring occurs regularly in nature and, at times, provides the virus with the capability of causing widespread disease in immunologically naïve populations...|$|E
40|$|Swine flu, {{also known}} as swine influenza, pig influenza, <b>hog</b> <b>flu</b> and pig flu, is a {{respiratory}} disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs, resulting in nasal secretions, a barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behaviour. Swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. Mostly people who are closely associated with pigs (for example, pork processors and farmers) acquire the infection and similarly pigs get infected occasionally human flu infection. The cross-species infections (swine virus to man; human flu virus to pigs) have always been confined to local areas and have not spread across borders in either pigs or humans. Unfortunately, this cross-species situation with influenza viruses has {{had the potential to}} change and cause epidemics and pandemics. Most recent pandemic has been reported in 2009,  where "swine flu" strain, first seen in Mexico, was termed as H 1 N 1 as it was mainly infecting people and exhibited two main surface antigens, H 1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and N 1 (neuraminidase type 1). This unique eight RNA strands from novel H 1 N 1 flu have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Since then it has been infecting people here and there.  </p...|$|E
