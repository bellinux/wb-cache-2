40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in obese patients {{is higher than}} in the general population. Classical predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation {{have been shown to be}} unreliable. We prospectively evaluated <b>indirect</b> mirror <b>laryngoscopy</b> as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients. Materials and Methods: 60 patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia, were enrolled. <b>Indirect</b> mirror <b>laryngoscopy</b> was performed and was graded 1 - 4 according to Cormack and Lehane. A view of grade 3 - 4 was classified as predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Additional assessments for comparison were the Samsoon and Young modification of the Mallampati airway classification, Wilson Risk Sum Score, neck circumference, and BMI. The view obtained upon direct laryngoscopy after induction of general anesthesia was classified according to Cormack and Lehane as grade 1 - 4. Results: Sixty patients met the inclusion criteria; however, 8 (13. 3 %) patients had an excessive gag reflex, and examination of the larynx was not possible. 15. 4 % of patients who underwent direct laryngoscopy had a Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 view and were classified as difficult. Mirror laryngoscopy had a tendency toward statistical significance in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in these patients. Conclusions: This study is consistent with previous studies, which have demonstrated that no one individual traditional test has proven to be adequate in predicting difficult airways in the obese population. However, the new application of an old test - <b>indirect</b> mirror <b>laryngoscopy</b> - could be a useful additional test to predict difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients...|$|R

40|$|Lipoma is {{a benign}} tumour of mesenchymal origin {{with a very}} rare {{occurrence}} in the upper aero-digestive tract. To date, approximately 100 cases have been described in the literature. This lesion has a slow growth and, therefore, can present with various symptoms due to the mass effect with obstruction and compression on neighbouring structures, including dysphagia for liquid and solid food, dyspnoea and hoarseness. For a precise pre-operative diagnosis, <b>indirect</b> or direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> (flexible fibre-optic laryngoscopy) can be employed or, if necessary, also imaging techniques such as computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging scan.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Direct {{laryngoscopy}} is {{the method}} currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. <b>Indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, {{with the potential}} to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta-analysis to compare direct versus <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www. clinicaltrials. gov and www. controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta-analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5. 49 seconds, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 37 to 9. 60; I(2) = 90 %; very low-quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 02; I(2) = 67 %; low-quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4. 93, 95 % CI 1. 33 to 18. 31; I(2) = 0 %; low-quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low-quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, group. Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low-quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> group (P = 0. 007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0. 001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low-quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, group. Use of <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 21; I(2) = 59 %). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low-quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy,</b> or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo {{surgery to}} the {{esophagus}} and lungs are in jeopardy of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) damage during the procedure. This {{study was designed}} to investigate the feasibility of intraoperative monitoring of the RLN for single-lung ventilation esophagus and lung surgery. METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients booked for esophagus or lung surgery were included in this prospective, observational study. Six patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy for carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction or lower esophagus, five had a lobectomy, and one underwent a pneumonectomy for lung carcinoma. Intraoperative, noninvasive RLN identification and monitoring was performed unilaterally (n = 8) or bilaterally (n = 4) using a handheld stimulator and a laryngeal surface electrode. The correct functioning of the nerve monitoring system was tested directly at the vagus nerve. Diagnosis of postoperative RLN paralysis was performed using <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy.</b> RESULTS: During the surgical procedures, we monitored a nerve signal in all 12 patients. In one patient with lower esophagus carcinoma, a nerve signal could be detected only on one side. Postoperative <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> showed normal vocal cord movement in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative RLN identification and monitoring during single-lung ventilation surgery is technically feasible, easy, and reliable.

Our goal was to develop a new diagnostic method wherein direct laryngoscopy can be performed by videogastroscope which unlike fiberoptic- or video- laryngoscopy, is readily available at most of the centres. Methods: Between May 2009 and December 2009, 1462 consecutive patients underwent <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> for evaluation of laryngeal disorders at ENT outpatient department. Fifty-two (93. 6 %) consecutive patients who had unsuccessful, inconclusive or incomplete examination underwent direct laryngoscopy with videogastroscope.

Objective: To estimate the validity of neuromonitoring with regard to postoperative laryngeal motility verified with <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy.</b> Methods: A prospective study in 185 patients (342 RLN included) undergoing first intervention of partial or total thyroidectomy. We collected qualitative variables of neuromonitoring (presence or absence of final signal after stimulation of the vagus nerve) and postoperative <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> (normal motility or paralysis) performed on the 1 st to 3 rd day (laryngoscopy 1) and from 3 rd to 4 th week (laryngoscopy 2). Results: The accuracy of the test was 99. 7 % in laryngoscopy 1 and 98. 8 % in laryngoscopy 2. The positive predictive value (100 %) shows the high ability of neuromonitoring to predict paralysis in case of loss of signal and the negative predictive value (99. 7 % in laryngoscopy 1 and 98. 12 % in laryngoscopy 2) indicates its predictive capacity for normal motility when there is a normal signal. Conclusions: Neuromonitoring is useful for planning and deciding different strategies in case of signal loss or if there was prior laryngeal paralysis.

40|$|Objective*/Whilst {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in enhancing the quality of <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> and image processing, the evaluation of clinical findings is still based on the clinician’s judgement. The aim of this paper was to examine the feasibility of an objective computer-based method for evaluating laryngeal disease. Material and Methods*/Digitally recorded images obtained by 908 - and 708 -angled indirect rod laryngoscopy using standardized white balance values were made of 16 patients and 19 healthy subjects. The digital images were evaluated manually by the clinician based on a standardized questionnaire, and suspect lesions were marked and classified on the image. Following colour separation, normal vocal cord areas as well as suspect lesions were analyzed automatically using cooccurrence matrices, which compare colour differences between neighbouring pixels over a predefined distance. Results*/Whilst colour histograms did not provide sufficient information for distinguishing between healthy and diseased tissues, consideration of the blue content of neighbouring pixels enabled a correct classification in 81. 4 % of cases.

40|$|Background: The {{experiences}} of seasoned practitioners {{with the new}} C-MAC indirect videolaryngoscope system have shown promising results {{in the management of}} difficult airways. However, a comparison of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> utilizing the C-MAC system as its own control has not been performed in a cohort of anesthesiologists-in-training. The primary aim was to compare direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> in terms of intubation time with secondary outcomes including laryngoscopy time and airway view with the same size 3 blade. Methods: The study was registered with www. clinicaltrials. gov (NCT 01104090).

40|$|SUMMARY – The {{purpose of}} this review is to compare old {{conventional}} techniques and de-vices for difficult airway management and new sophisticated techniques and devices. Recent tech-niques and devices are defined as the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) practice guidelines {{for the management of}} difficult airway, published in 1992, reviewed in 1993 and updated in 2003. According to ASA, the techniques for difficult airway management are divided into techniques for difficult intubation and techniques for difficult ventilation. Awake fiberoptic intubation is the technique of choice for difficult airway management prescribed by the World Health Organization document for patient safety in the operating theater. Conventional techniques for intubation used direct visualization. The new generation of devices does not require direct visualization of the vocal cords for endotracheal tube placement. They allow better glottis view and successful endotracheal placement of the tube with <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy.</b> New intubation devices such as video laryn-goscopes facilitate endotracheal intubation by indirect visualization of glottis structures without aligning the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes in patients with cervical spine abnormality. Video laryngoscopes such as V-Mac and C-Mac, Glide scope, McGrath, Airway Scope, Airtraq, Bonfils and Bullard laryngoscope are widely available at the market. Airway gadgets are lighted stylets and endotracheal tube guides. The principal conclusion of this review is that utilization of these devices can be easily learned. The technique of <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> is currently used for managing difficult airway in the operating room as well as for securing the airway in daily anesthesia routine...|$|E
40|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> allows {{practitioners}} to “see around the corner” of a patient’s airway during intubation. Inadequate airway management {{is a major}} contributor to patient injury, morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the video quality of commercially available video laryngoscopy systems. A team of four investigators at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and the Peter Kiewit Institute performed intubation simulations using a number of video laryngoscopy systems. Testing was done with a Laerdal Difficult Airway Manikin (Laerdal Medical Corp., Wappingers Falls, NY) in a setting that simulated difficult airways, adverse lighting conditions and various system configurations (e. g., maximizing screen contrast, minimizing screen brightness, maximizing screen color hue, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Laryngectomy {{is always}} a {{challenging}} surgery both from surgical and anaesthesiologist′s perspective. The situation can get worse when such patients present with advanced laryngeal cancerrequire a definite surgical intervention along with thyroid gland removal. Apart from anesthetic difficulties in managing the deranged anatomy and pathophysiology, management of difficult airway during peri-operative period can be a huge challenging task. We are reporting a case of laryngeal carcinoma that was posted for laryngectomy and thyroidectomy as the thyroid gland was also invaded to a small extent. A difficult airway situation was anticipated as during <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> {{it was observed that}} the glottic covering was occluded to a large extent by a soft tissue growth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Isolated {{laryngeal}} leishmaniasis {{is a rare}} {{condition and}} we report a 46 years old patient who presented with progressive, non fluctuating hoarseness of voice for 8 months along with foreign body sensation of throat and difficulty in swallowing. <b>Indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> followed by flexible nasoendoscopy revealed grossly edematous epiglottis, right arytenoid, right aryepiglottic fold and medial wall of the right pyriform sinus. Direct laryngoscope was performed under general anesthesia and biopsy was taken. The histopathology report section revealed numerous extracellular L. D. bodies in an inflammatory milieu comprising of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages set in an edematous subepithelial stroma. He has no other systemic manifestation. He had no HIV infection or immunocompromised condition nor took immunosuppressive drugs. He responded well with liposoma...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{laryngoscopy}} {{with the}} Macintosh Laryngoscope {{has been the}} gold standard for tracheal intubation since 1940 s. 1 Failed attempts to intubate the trachea and secure airway, both in the operating room and outside, still remains a cause of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. 2 - 5 Investigation is, therefore, in progress to find the best methods and/or equipment to augment the success rate and lessen the potential complications of tracheal intubation. 6, 7 The Airtraq Laryngoscope (Prodol, Meditec, Viscaza, Spain) (Figure 1) was first reported as a useful device for <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> and tracheal intubation in 2006. 8 Applications of the Airtraq are not limited to difficult intubation. 9 Some studies have shown its advantages over the Macintosh Laryngoscope with regard to “first attemp...|$|E
40|$|A 48 {{year old}} man {{presented}} to our outpatient department {{with the history}} of absolute dysphagia, and fever for two days. On examination patient was febrile with drooling of saliva. Oropharynx was minimally congested. <b>Indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> revealed odematous epiglottis with pus pointing over the lingual surface. Radiography of soft tissue, neck lateral view, showed the thumb sign which suggested epiglottitis.   Incision and drainage was performed under general anaesthesia after haematological investigations. Patient was extubated the next day, and was discharged after two days, also oral antibiotics, and analgesics were prescribed. Patient was reviewed after 2 weeks, and <b>indirect</b> <b>laryngoscopy</b> revealed a normal epiglottis. Although pharyngitis is {{the most common cause of}} sore throat in adults, acute epiglottitis must be considered in differential diagnosis when there is unrelenting throat pain, and minimal objective signs of pharyngitis. Epiglottic abscess formation is more common in adults than children. They most commonly occur as a complication of acute pharyngitis or with abscess of lingual tonsil. The abscess most frequently comes to a point on or near the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Streptococcus was isolated more frequently. Other organisms reported were Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Micro- coccus catarrhalis, Pneumococci. In our case, there were no preceding symptoms of acute pharyngitis. Risk factors include adult age at onset, diabetes mellitus, trauma, presence of a foreign body, and immune- compromised state. This case is unusual because of the absence of above risk factors. Incision and drainage under general anaesthesia is the treatment of choice. To the author’s knowledge, very few cases of acute epiglottic abscesses have been reported in the literature. This case is unusual because there are no preceding symptoms of pharyngitis or tonsillitis, and no association of risk factors like diabetes mellitus, trauma, foreign body or immunocompromised state...|$|E
