Results—In the 5 experimental teams that used KEB productivity is almost double compared to previous data without the KEB. Conclusions—We can assume that the theory is extendible to the development process according to which using KEB in maintenance processes improves developer productivity as it mitigates the errors made due to the amount of decisions taken during project execution. Experience collected in PROMETHEUS becomes part of the organizational culture, being it formalized...|$|E
