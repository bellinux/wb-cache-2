40|$|After {{economic}} crises happening in many emerging countries, {{flexible exchange rates}} became a required theoretical condition helping to target inflation. Many countries stopped using exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy and started using inflation targeting framework. In emerging countries, monetary authorities work to stabilize the exchange rate because of their “fear of floating”. They are against high volatility of interest rate allowing speculative attacks and causing free fluctuations of their national currency. To avoid uncontrolled market movements, they {{have to choose between}} active and public exchange rate management and tight inflation targeting. In the same vein, Central bank of Tunisia follows financial measures linked closely to inflation without focusing especially on monetary aggregates in order to study a possible transition to targeting inflation strategy. It uses a simple Taylor rule where interest rates adjustment are guided by the anticipated inflation deviation from its original target and also by the gap between observed and potential GDP. As an emerging economy {{with a high degree of}} financial vulnerability, and facing different shocks, Tunisia should adopt a <b>hybrid</b> <b>rule</b> of inflation targeting in an open economy.

40|$|A general {{framework}} is proposed for integration {{of rules and}} external first order theories. It {{is based on the}} well-founded semantics of normal logic programs and inspired by ideas of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and constructive negation for logic programs. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>rules</b> are normal clauses extended with constraints in the bodies; constraints are certain formulae {{in the language of the}} external theory. A hybrid program is a pair of a set of <b>hybrid</b> <b>rules</b> and an external theory. Instances of the framework are obtained by specifying the class of external theories, and the class of constraints. An example instance is integration of (non-disjunctive) Datalog with ontologies formalized as description logics. The paper defines a declarative semantics of hybrid programs and a goal-driven formal operational semantics. The latter can be seen as a generalization of SLS-resolution. It provides a basis for hybrid implementations combining Prolog with constraint solvers. Soundness of the operational semantics is proven. Sufficient conditions for decidability of the declarative semantics, and for completeness of the operational semantics are given...|$|R

The first is that the created neurule bases usually contain multiple representations of the same piece of knowledge.

To remedy these deficiencies, we introduce an extension to neurules, called multineurules, and an alternative inference process, which is rather symbolism oriented.

40|$|Neurules are a kind {{of hybrid}} rules that combine a {{symbolic}} (production rules) and a connectionist (adaline unit) representation. Each neurule is represented as an adaline unit. One way that the neurules can be produced is from training examples (empirical source knowledge). However, in certain application fields not all of the training examples are available a priori. A number of them become available over time. In these cases, updating the corresponding neurules is necessary. In this paper, methods for updating a <b>hybrid</b> <b>rule</b> base, consisting of neurules, to reflect the availability of new training examples are presented. The methods are efficient, since they require the least possible retraining effort and the number of the produced neurules is kept as small as possible...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an approach for target tracking, which incorporates the advanced concept of generalized data (kinematics and attribute) association to improve track maintenance performance in complicated situations (closely spaced targets), when kinematics data are insufficient for correct decision making.

The main peculiarity consists in applying the principles of Dezert-Smarandache theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning to model and process the utilized attribute data.

40|$|Until recently, {{the costs}} of litigating federal tax cases were borne {{exclusively}} by the parties who incurred them, {{regardless of whether the}} government or the taxpayer prevailed in the litigation. This practice reflects the application to tax disputes of the ‘American rule’ against fee shifting. Although the American rule continues to be predominant in the tax area, it has been modified in important respects. An explicit fee-reimbursement rule, benefiting prevailing taxpayers in cases in which the government is found to have acted unreasonably, was added to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). TEFRA also increased substantially the penalties that could be imposed on taxpayers who are found to have instituted tax litigation on frivolous grounds, or primarily for delay. The provisions are not precise counterparts of each other: one is a true fee-reimbursement rule, while the other is a penalty provision that is not directly tied to litigation costs. Nevertheless, the rules are similar in their effects on incentives to litigate tax cases. This article begins with a brief description and history of these provisions, followed by an analysis of their impact on litigation decisionmaking in the tax area. We argue that the present mix of fee-shifting rules in tax cases represents an attractive hybrid of the American rule and the ‘English rule,’ which normally allows recovery of costs by the prevailing party. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>rule</b> seems likely to deter parties from bringing poorly grounded cases to court without discouraging litigants with sounder positions. It thus combines the best features of each of the more traditional rules. After analyzing the <b>hybrid</b> <b>rule,</b> we discuss the recent changes to the rule made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and argue that those changes, on balance, do not represent improvements over the original TEFRA rules, and may indeed prove troublesome in the coming years...|$|E
