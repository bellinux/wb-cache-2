5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E

In British usage, the word station is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified.|$|E
25|$|South of Catstye Cam, {{nestling}} {{between the}} encircling arms of Helvellyn's two edges, is Red Tarn. This pool {{is named for}} the colour of the surrounding screes rather than its water, and contains brown trout and schelly, a fresh-water herring. The depth of Red Tarn <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> 80ft, although in the mid-19th century it was dammed with boulders to increase capacity. This was carried out to provide additional water to the Greenside Mine in Glenridding, the water race still visible as it crosses the slope of Birkhouse Moor.|$|E

25|$|There {{was high}} {{agreement}} and much evidence that stabilization {{could be achieved}} by 2050 using currently available technologies, provided appropriate and effective incentives {{were put in place}} for their development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion, and that barriers were removed. For stabilization at lower levels the IPCC agreed that improvements of carbon intensity need to be made much faster than has been the case in the past, and {{that there would be a}} greater need for efficient public and private research, development and demonstration efforts and investment in new technologies during the next few decades. The IPCC points out that government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nearly 20 years, and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> half the 1980 level. Delays in cutting emissions would lead to higher stabilization levels and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts, as more of the current high-emission technologies would have been deployed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that the present site of Cromer, around the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul, is what was in 1337 called Shipden-juxta-Felbrigg, {{and by the end of}} the 14th century known as Cromer. A reference to a place called Crowemere Shipden can be seen in a legal record, dated 1422, (1 Henry VI), the home of John Gees. The other Shipden <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> a quarter of a mile to the north east of the end of Cromer Pier, under the sea. Its site is marked by Church Rock, now no longer visible, even at a low spring tide. In 1888 a small pleasure steamer called Victoria struck the remains of the church tower, and the rock was subsequently blown up for safety. In the present day, members of Great Yarmouth sub-aqua club dived at the site, and salvaged artefacts from both the medieval church and the wreck of Victoria.|$|E

Dunster has a range of heritage sites and cultural attractions which combine with the castle to make it a popular tourist destination with many visitors arriving on the West Somerset Railway, a heritage railway running from Minehad to Bishops Lydeard.|$|E

A writer from French music blog The Drone described Far Side Virtual as a concept album inspired by the ideas of hyperreality and simulacra from the post-modern cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard. Harper wrote, [...] "Up until Far Side Virtual, many of James Ferraro's albums were impressionistic lo-fi portraits of bygone eras – perhaps on Far Side Virtual he decided to represent the present as is and then let nature take its course, over time, and do the aging for him. Returning to it in ten or twenty years time, we might discover that it was ironically a victim of its own futurist acceleration, and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> as up-to-date as a ten-year-old carton of milk." ...|$|E
500|$|After Chloe asks Lois {{to steal}} the {{components}} and plans of Lionel Luthor's memory device, Project Intercept, with Oliver, Chloe had Emil Hamilton build it with upgrades so she can find information from the remnants of her deceased counterpart's memories. Inside {{what is left of}} her counterpart's mind, Chloe finds a universe coming to an end, caused by an attack led by a powerful gargantuan being; she also witnesses Lois Queen's death. She finds she now has some of the memories of her counterpart, and discovers her killer is one of the Multiverse's guardians, the Monitors. After taking a leave of absence with Oliver, Chloe later return as Clark begins to gather everyone to make a stand against The Monitors. At this point, Chloe <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> nine months pregnant. After the Monitors' defeat, Chloe gives birth to a baby boy, whom she and Oliver named [...] "Jonathan," [...] after Clark's late-adoptive father Jonathan Kent.|$|E

2500|$|The castle was {{originally}} {{built on the}} south bank of the Thames, although the shoreline has since receded {{as a result of}} land reclamation; the river <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> [...] north of the castle, separated from it by marshes. It was constructed by John Cobham, whose family had acquired the manor of Cooling in the mid-13th century. In 1379, during {{the second phase of the}} Hundred Years' War, a French raid devastated towns and villages along the Thames Estuary. Cobham appealed to the Crown for licence to fortify his manor and received permission in February 1380. The building work was completed by 1385.|$|E
2500|$|Southwold Pier {{was built}} in 1900. [...] At [...] it was long enough to {{accommodate}} the Belle steamers which carried trippers along the coast at that time. In World War II, it was weakened by two breaches, and in 1955 a large section was destroyed by a gale. The pier was entirely rebuilt and restored in 2001 and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> [...] long. Whilst many English seaside piers are in decline, Southwold Pier is enjoying renewed popularity, helped by a collection of modern coin-operated novelty machines made by Tim Hunkin and the occasional berth of paddle steamers such as PS Waverley and the MV Balmoral.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1953, {{most of the}} faculties {{have been}} {{situated}} on Sparrow Hills, in the southwest of Moscow, 5km from the city center. The main building was designed by architect Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev. In the post-war era, Joseph Stalin ordered seven huge tiered neoclassic towers to be built around the city. It was built using Gulag labour, as were many of Stalin's Great Construction Projects in Russia. Located on Moscow's outskirts {{at the time of}} its construction, the location of the main building <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>about</b> half-way between the center of Moscow at the Kremlin and the city's current limits. The Journalism Department now occupies the university's original location in downtown Moscow across from the Manezh, steps from the Kremlin and other government buildings. [...] Indeed, frequent student unrest, including street protests, well pre-dating 1917 may be one reason why Stalin's planners sited the university across the Moscow River, so far away.|$|E
