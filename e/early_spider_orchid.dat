Sand bees use pheromones {{in order to identify}} a mate; in the case of A. nigroaenea, the females emit a mixture of tricosane (C23H48), pentacosane (C25H52) and heptacosane (C27H56) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen, ...|$|E

50|$|Firle Escarpment is a Site of Special Scientific Interest at Firle in the South Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in {{the county}} of East Sussex, England.

50|$|The main chalk {{grassland}} communities are CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum and CG5 Bromus erectus - Brachypodium pinnatum. The reserve supports a rich flora and is notable for its orchids {{which include the}} nationally scarce Burnt Orchid (Neotinea ustulata) and <b>Early</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Ophrys sphegodes). The {{chalk grassland}} is an important site for insects. It is the only site in Kent for the Wart-biter (Decticus verrucivorus) and also supports the Silver-spotted Skipper (Hesperia comma), Adonis Blue (Polyommatus bellargus) and Chalkhill Blue (Polyommatus coridon).|$|E

Variety of living environments, provides the evolution of plant species that have different ecological inclination. The most interesting section of the nature reserve in terms of plants are the sand dunes between the lake and the sea. Oleander and acantholimon dominates the section, from the lagoons climbing up to the dune hills. At the inner section, broomrape, kidney weed, common vetch and alfalfa is plenty. The shrub species of the reserve are myrtle, blackberry and common smilax. The dune valleys are covered with <b>early</b> <b>spider</b> <b>orchid,</b> serapias and orchis spitzelii.|$|E

50|$|The isle has {{the highest}} number of species of native and anciently {{introduced}} wild flowers of any area of comparable size in Britain. This is largely due to the varied geology. The species most frequently sought is <b>Early</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Ophrys sphegodes), which in Britain, is most common on Purbeck. Nearly 50,000 flowering spikes were counted in 2009. Late April is the best time, and the largest population is usually in the field to the west of Dancing Ledge. Smaller numbers can be seen on a shorter walk in Durlston Country Park.

40|$|Many {{valuable}} and threatened taxons {{of the family}} Orchidaceae, including the representatives of genus Ophrys, are disappearing from semi-natural grasslands because of the advancing secondary succession. Conservation and restoration of calcareous grasslands rich in species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt. requires appropriate interventions after the traditional forms of management will be finished. Bromus erectus is the dominant species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt., hence {{it is necessary to}} choose adequate intervention aim of which would be the reduced dominance of this species. Restoration of extensive sheep grazing in this calcareous grassland is not realistic. This is the reason why it is proposed to mow every year or at least every two years (and remove the mown mass) the growths where the taxons of genus Ophrys occur. The best moment for mowing is after maturation of the Orchid Genus Ophrys seeds. With regard to the phenologic cycles of the species concerned, the following mowing terms are proposed: end of June for the locality with occurrence of <b>Early</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Ophrys sphegodes), July for localities with occurrence of Late Spider Orchid (O. holosericea) and Fly Orchid (O. insectifera). The locality with Bee Orchid (Ophrys apifera) does not require mowing due to shallow soil (Lithosol) and vegetation that is close to Poo badensis-Festucetum pallentis association. If mowing cannot be used on the particular dates, it is proposed to mow the growths with the dominating species Bromus erectus in October. The study presents the example how the number of flowering <b>Early</b> <b>Spider</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Ophrys sphegodes) individuals increased after the locality was mown by the employees of the State Nature Conservation in autumn 2004. Their number more than quadrupled in 2005...|$|E
40|$|Orchid Observers is a {{collaboration}} between the Natural History Museum and the University of Oxford. The project {{is located on the}} Zooniverse platform and has been developed as part of the Constructing Scientific Communities Project. Fifty-six native species of orchid grow wild in the UK, flowering from April to September. Recent research indicates that climate change is affecting the flowering time of the <b>early</b> <b>spider</b> <b>orchid,</b> Ophrys sphegodes. The Natural History Museum (NHM) wants to find out if this is true for other wild orchids and whether all species are responding in the same way. The Orchid Observers project will investigate effect of climate change on the flowering times of 29 of the UK orchid species. The project asks volunteers to carry out field photography and biological recording, with online transcriptions of the 15, 000 historic herbarium specimens in the NHM. The herbarium specimens were collected over 300 years, which tell researchers about the flowering times in the past...|$|E
