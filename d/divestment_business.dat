50|$|With the {{instability}} in the film industry due to theater <b>divestment,</b> the <b>business</b> was considered risky. In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25% share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1 million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3 million.|$|R

50|$|In July 2004, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) (PCUSA) {{voted to}} {{initiate}} a process of selective <b>divestment</b> in <b>businesses</b> that it believes bear particular responsibility for the suffering of Palestinians, such as Caterpillar Inc. In 2012 the church decided to reject divestment. In 2014 the Presbyterians decided, {{by a vote of}} 310 to 303, to divest from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions, which the church said supply Israel with equipment used in the occupation of Palestinian territory.|$|R
2500|$|Paul was {{the only}} [...] "no" [...] vote on , the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 (passed House 418–1–13, not {{reported}} out of committee in the Senate), which would [...] "require the identification of companies that conduct business operations in Sudan [...] prohibit United States Government contracts with such companies". Among the bill's findings were Colin Powell's Senate testimony that the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias it supported were responsible for genocide, and the observation that many Americans inadvertently invest in foreign companies which disproportionately benefit the Sudanese regime in Khartoum. Paul cited the past ineffectiveness of sanctions against Cuba and Iraq as evidence against <b>divestment</b> from <b>businesses</b> connected to the Sudanese government.|$|R
50|$|On 9 March 2010, Santander {{sold the}} {{investment}} and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million. Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase {{the branches of}} The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland {{as part of a}} <b>divestment</b> of the <b>business</b> by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the impact}} of {{divestment}} {{is likely to have}} limited quantitative success in reducing carbon emissions, the movement can gain momentum as a symbolic gesture that has the potential to shift social expectations of investment practices within <b>businesses.</b> <b>Divestment</b> {{has the potential to be}} effective if the divested funds are re-invested into the infrastructure of a low-carbon economyThe impact of divestment is believed to be minimal as the continual purchase of oil and gas (and oil and gas derived products such as plastics) will still sustain the oil and gas companies.|$|R
30|$|While {{research}} has studied how internal disruption {{can be managed}} through integration programs, it could be interesting {{to assess the impact}} of external factors such as the institutional environment or sudden external shifts in technology or regulation on the PMI process. Capron and Guillén (2009) found that strong shareholder rights enabled, while labor rights impeded, the acquirer to make post-merger changes, with a firm’s M&A experience moderating this relationship. One could speculate, for instance, that very disruptive environments may be conducive to more modular approaches that would favor preservation—to remain more flexible and to be able to divest when necessary. Researchers could be interested in the process of dis-integration after divestiture. 2 Scholars could thoroughly assess the reconfiguration of resources between a divested unit and its parent firm, which may have shared resources prior to divestment. Units that are more integrated through processes of PMI would require different processes of <b>divestment</b> than <b>businesses</b> that were not integrated in the first place.|$|R
50|$|A new {{management}} team determined that Inchcape had {{to focus on}} its core international distribution businesses in order {{to turn things around}} and began making significant <b>business</b> <b>divestments,</b> including selling the Bain Hogg insurance brokerage subsidiary (formed by the merger of Inchcape's brokerage operation with Bain Clarkson, and the Hogg Group in 1994 and ranked the eleventh largest broker in the world in 1995) to the Aon Corporation in the United States for £160 million in 1996. In the same year the testing service division was part of a management buy-out by Charterhouse Development Capital and renamed Intertek Testing Services.|$|R
2500|$|A {{published}} EU {{report in}} early 2012 made an urgent {{call for the}} EU to adopt a more [...] "active and visible" [...] implementation of its policy towards Israel and the peace process. A potentially radical proposal for [...] "appropriate EU legislation to prevent/discourage financial transactions in support of settlement activity" [...] was the first indication that some member states were seeking European <b>divestment</b> from <b>businesses</b> {{actively involved in the}} settlement enterprise. Under one interpretation of the proposal, the Commission would use legislation to force companies in Europe to break their links with businesses involved in settlement construction and commercial activities. The report also recommended the EU prepare a blacklist of settlers involved in violence, in order to possibly ban them from entering EU member states, encourage PLO activity and representation in east Jerusalem, and for senior EU officials to avoid being escorted by Israeli representatives or security personnel in east Jerusalem. The issue of the PLO/Fatah and East Jerusalem has been a flashpoint between Israel and many EU countries because EU diplomats have often met their Palestinian counterparts in the city but have rarely met with Israeli government officials there (even in West Jerusalem, which the EU sees as a current and future part of Israel), which also ties into how the EU has tried to present Tel Aviv as the Israeli capital even though the central seat of government and most government facilities are located in Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Micro {{companies}} {{constitute the}} largest group of companies in Finland and they have an important role in employment and growth. The percentual number of micro companies in Finland in 2013 was 93. 4 % of all the company sizes. The economist Samuli Rikama (2014), from the Ministry of Employment and the economy in Finland, stated in the annual Business Review that micro companies have indisputable significance in Finnish society promoting economic growth and employment and yet the field lacks attention in research and the importance of the sector is often seen trivial. This qualitative case study is investigating a customer-led development process in a micro company. The goal is to find out, how the selected service is appearing to the main customer segment and what are the developmental issues arise from the customers. The research is conducted an action research which goals for developing the existing operations model (Huovinen & Rovio: 94 − 95). The framework for development is attribute map by Gunther McGrath and MacMillan (2000 : 25). The research is also investigating the meaning of the development process for the case company in micro company context. The development process is conducted as an action research and it commits to the hermeneutic tradition is science. The hermeneutic perspective emphasizes interpretation and prospect of significance in a process which produces information of the reality as overlapping cycle. The data collected in triangulation consist of an owner theme interview, electric inquiry with the customers and a theme group conversation among different professionals. The data is thematized with an attribute map in collecting and analyzing the data. The results of the research propose that the developmental needs of the case company are related to marketing, communications, networking and web-sales. The research provided new opportunities to improve supporting operations and the product under investigation received positive feedback from the customers. The product was evaluated as a differentiator in the customer inquiry. The results concerning the meaning of the process raised the need to sustain an active role in development and networking both in the case company and in the micro company context. Understanding the developmental possibilities in the micro company context and issues considering continuity and growth, the research results can provide aspects for change of generation or <b>divestment</b> processes, <b>business</b> model generation and in general, conception of the practical level. Further research of micro company entrepreneurship provides information for economic and societal perspectives and decision-making in general...|$|R
