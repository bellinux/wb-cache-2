40|$|In this thesis, {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} the transport properties of three nanoscale systems: one-dimensional (1 D) quantum wires (QWRs), zero-dimensional (0 D), laterally confined, double-barrier resonant tunnelling structures (DBRTSs) and three-terminal ballistic junctions (TBJs), have been performed. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, an overview of the realization and properties of such systems is given along with a description of modelling tools used in the calculations. The second and main part of the thesis contains the original research results, summarized into seven papers. The conductance of QWRs with corrugated boundaries is investigated in Paper I with respect to the nature of the boundary roughness, geometrical parameters of the QWR and temperature. It is shown that, due to the structural imperfections, the conductance exhibits rapid fluctuations, strong, broad dips between adjacent conductance plateaus at very low temperatures and, in general, a suppression of the conductance below the values expected for an ideal QWR. The results agree with existing experimental results. Experimental {{studies of the}} transport properties of 0 D quantum dots obtained by laterally confining vertical DBRTSs by means of metallic gates have shown complex, gate-dependent fine structure in the measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. The origin of this fine structure is theoretically studied and explained (Papers II-V) in terms of quasi- 1 D- 0 D- 1 D systems with a tunable lateral confinement. It is shown that, due to the low dimensionality of the <b>emitter,</b> <b>dot</b> and collector regions, complex fine structure, which is strongly dependent on Fermi energy, source-drain voltage, and gate voltage, is formed in the I-V characteristics, which may explain the experimentally observed results. A tentative comparison between experiments and theory is made in Paper IV. Three-terminal junction systems have very recently emerged as excellent candidates for use as building blocks in the formation of nanoscale electronic devices. A general formalism for the calculation of electron transport through three- terminal quantum structures is presented in Paper VI. Using this method, the transport through Y-shaped TBJ structures is studied in Paper VII. Quantum effects are shown to influence the transport properties of TBJs at low temperatures, possibly enabling new device functionality...|$|E

The periodic variation of the gate potentials allows for a net dc current through the device even with no dc voltage applied: if the system is driven at a frequency (or subharmonic) corresponding to the energy difference between two time-independent eigenstates, the electrons become completely delocalized between {{the left and right}} dot.

The individual studies are concerned with passive 1 D silicon photonic crystal nanobeam cavities and deterministic, site-selectively grown arrays of InAs quantum dots. For the combined system, strong light matter coupling in a quantum dot photonic crystal slab nanocavity is discussed. Vacuum Rabi splitting is seen when the interaction strength exceeds the dissipative processes of the coupled system. In order to increase the probability of a spectral matching between cavity modes and quantum dot transitions, a technique for condensing an inert gas onto a sample is used. This can lead to a spectral tuning of up to 4 nm of the cavity mode with minimal change in the cavity quality factor while maintaining cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K. The effect of a large density of quantum dots within a quantum dot photonic crystal slab nanocavity is also addressed. Gain and absorption effects are found to occur, changing the cavity emission linewidth from that of its intrinsic value, as well as lasing with a low number of quantum dots and with high spontaneous emission coupling factors. Additionally, methods for improving the quality factor of GaAs photonic crystal cavities and better understanding different loss mechanisms are discussed. In the individual studies, the site-selective growth of InAs quantum dots on pre-structured GaAs wafers is shown as a promising method for the eventual deterministic fabrication of photonic crystal cavities to single quantum dots. An in-situ annealing step is used to reduce quantum dot density, helping ensure that dots are not grown in unwanted locations.

Photons are a promising candidate for encoding qubits but assembling a photonic entangled cluster with linear optical elements relies on probabilistic operations.

In this paper, we prove {{that there is a}} fundamental tradeoff between n and the minimum success probability λ_c^(n) that each two-photon linear-optical fusion operation must have, in order to guarantee that the resulting state can be renormalized: λ_c^(n) > 1 /(n- 1).

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from IoP Publishing via the DOI in this record. Understanding {{unwanted}} mutual interactions between devices at the nanoscale is crucial for the study of the electromagnetic compatibility in nanoelectronic and nanophotonic systems. Anomalous electromagnetic coupling (crosstalk) between nanodevices may arise from the combination of electromagnetic interaction and quantum entanglement. In this paper we study in detail the crosstalk between two identical nanodevices, each consisting of a quantum <b>emitter</b> (atom, quantum <b>dot,</b> etc), capacitively coupled to a pair of nanoelectrodes. Using the generalized susceptibility concept, the overall system is modeled as a two-port within the framework of the electrical circuit theory and it is characterized by the admittance matrix. We show that the entanglement changes dramatically the physical picture of the electromagnetic crosstalk. In particular, the excitation produced in one of the ports may be redistributed in equal parts between both the ports, in spite of the rather small electromagnetic interactions. Such an anomalous crosstalk is expected to appear at optical frequencies in lateral GaAs double quantum dots. A possible experimental set up is also discussed. The classical concepts of interference in the operation of electronic devices, which have been known since the early days of radio-communications and are associated with electromagnetic compatibility, should then be reconsidered at the nanoscale.

Mn was found to diffuse into the stem of wires. HRTEM images show 			the presence of defects (stacking faults) in nanowires. Raman 			spectroscopy was used for optical characterization of nanowires and 			thus to determine the quality of these wires. Defects (stacking 			faults) were analyzed as the violation of Raman selection rules, 			which resulted in the asymmetrical broadening and the downshift of 			the LO and TO modes. We also observed some peaks at the low energy 			side of the TO peak of the GaAs and InAs NWs, irrespective of the 			catalyst used for the growth of NWs due to the oxide layer that 			surrounds the NWs. Surface optical phonons (SO) were found to be 			activated in both GaAs and InAs NWs. Phonon confinement model (PCM) 			was used to fit the LO phonon peaks, which also takes into account 			the contribution for asymmetry in the line shape caused by the 			presence of SO phonons and structural defects. This allowed to 			determine the correlation lengths in these wires, the average 			distance between defects and the defect density in these nanowires. 			Influence of these defects on SO phonon was also investigated. A 			good agreement between the experimental results and calculated for 			SO phonon mode by using the model presented by Ruppin and Englman 			was obtained. Statistical analysis of the data showed a distribution 			pattern of correlation length related to the growth conditions. Both 			Au and Mn catalyzed nanowires were found to exhibit similar quality, 			which indicates that Mn can replace Au catalyst resulting in 			magnetic impurity in the nanowires and giving us the opportunity to 			avoid the Au activated deep acceptor levels. 			To obtain the optical communication wavelength of 1. 31 and 1. 55 µm 			on GaAs substrates, InGaAs(N) /GaAs quantum wells and InAs(N) /GaAs(N) 			quantum dot structures were studied using photoluminescence 			spectroscopy. The samples were grown by MBE with a proper design of 			the samples by using stepped barriers to improve carrier trapping 			efficiency. Comparison of the luminescence from InAsN/GaAs and InAsN/GaAsN 			quantum dots was made with InGaNAs/GaAs quantum wells, grown under 			the same experimental conditions. Quantum <b>dot</b> <b>emitters</b> were found to 			exhibit higher thermal stability. The use of GaAsN barriers as 			opposed to GaAs barriers provided for narrower and more intense 			quantum-dot luminescence. Efficient room temperature emission of 			 1. 41 µm (0. 88 eV) has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is related}} to Quantum Electrodynamics in {{semiconductor}} systems, which is a currently a very active field. I present {{one of the first}} experimental demonstrations of the strong coupling regime (SCR) for a single quantum dot inserted in a microcavity. The manuscript shows the progression toward the SCR observation with in-depth studies of the electronic and optical properties of natural GaAs quantum dots. It is organized in 6 chapters. The first chapter recalls the necessary conditions for SCR observation, highlighting the most promising systems for the realisation of the SCR at the beginning of 2003. The candidate system was determined to be a combination of : (i) a GaAs/AlGaAs interface quantum dot exciton, because of its great oscillator strength and; (ii) a microdisk for the microcavity, because of the high quality factor of the whispering gallery modes. As well as the above criteria, there are some requirements on the linewidth of the exciton emission and of the cavity mode. Indeed, the transition between weak coupling and strong coupling occurs when the Rabi splitting becomes greater than the mean linewidth of the emitter and the cavity mode. These severe constraints led to the detailed studies on the electronic and optical properties of the quantum <b>dot</b> <b>emitter,</b> described in chapters II, III and IV. Chapter II presents the GaAs quantum dot samples. Structural analysis and optical characterisations in photoluminescence (PL) allow to distinguish two types of samples : a « small » quantum dot sample and a « large » quantum dot sample, as compared to the 2 D exciton Bohr radius. Chapter III concerns the coupling strength between the GaAs quantum dot excitons and the electromagnetic field. This work was essential as although considerable work has been previously published on InAs/AlGaAs quantum dot exciton characteristics, little is known regarding GaAs natural quantum dots. The main result of this chapter is the possibility of “engineering” the excitonic oscillator strength using the lateral quantum dot size. As the characteristic lifetimes of capture and recombination in these quantum dots are similar, the interpretation of the PL kinetics required modelling of the emission dynamics. Simple models, coupled to complementary experiments such as measurements of the photon emission statistics, lead to a good description of the light/matter coupling. I show that « large » quantum dots present a greater oscillator strength compared to smaller ones, and are for this reason a better candidate for the observation of the SCR if inserted in a microdisk. In addition to large oscillator strengths, GaAs quantum dots must exhibit an excitonic linewidth narrow enough to observe the SCR. I show theoretically and experimentally in chapter IV the dependence of the exciton-phonon coupling with the confinement of the exciton, which governs the spectral linewidths and their evolution with temperature. It is shown that large quantum dots present a reduced spectral broadening with temperature as compared to small quantum dots, further enforcing their advantages as a candidate for SCR observation. In chapter V, I present the fabrication process of GaAs/AlGaAs microdisks. I also present a new technique for the realisation of AlOx microdisks, which show some advantages over traditional microdisks. At the end of this chapter, I show that in both types of microdisks, whispering gallery modes exhibit high quality factors (Q> 10000) and small effective volumes, which satisfy the criteria for SCR observation. Chapter VI is the outcome of the extensive studies presented in the previous chapters. The exciton-photon SCR in a GaAs quantum dot within a microdisk is demonstrated for the first time. Spectral tuning of the exciton and the cavity mode with temperature showed the characteristic SCR anticrossing. A Rabi splitting twice as large as each individual linewidth is demonstrating, corresponding to a clear achievement of the SCR. In conclusion, this work has lead to the observation of strong quantum optical coupling effects in 0 D semiconductor nanostructures. It opens up a rich research path in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, with implications for Quantum Information Science as well as for fundamental optics. Lorsqu'un émetteur est placé dans une cavité, il existe deux régimes de couplage lumière-matière : dans le régime dit de couplage faible, la cavité a pour effet de modifier le taux d'émission spontanée de l'émetteur. Cet effet perturbateur de la cavité est connu sous le nom d'effet Purcell. Dans le régime dit de couplage fort, l'interaction dipolaire électrique n'est plus perturbative; les états-propres du système couplé sont des états mixtes lumière-matière. Dans le domaine temporel, ce couplage se traduit par le fait que l'émission spontanée devient réversible : le photon émis spontanément par l'émetteur dans le mode de cavité peut à nouveau être ré-absorbé par l'émetteur, puis ré-émis, [...] . donnant ainsi lieu à un cycle d'oscillations de Rabi. Dans le domaine spectral, le couplage se manifeste par une levée de dégénerescence (ou doublet de Rabi) lorsqu'émetteur et mode de cavité sont mis en résonance. L'objet de cette thèse est la démonstration expérimentale du couplage fort entre un exciton confiné par une boîte quantique naturelle de GaAs et un mode de galerie d'un microdisque semi-conducteur. Les paramètres-clefs pour atteindre ce régime sont, pour ce qui est de l'émetteur, sa force d'oscillateur ainsi que sa largeur spectrale, gouvernée par l'interaction avec l'environnement. Un chapitre est consacré à chacune de ces 2 notions-clefs. Concernant la cavité, les 2 figures de mérite pertinentes pour le renforcement de l'interaction lumière-matière sont le facteur de qualité et le volume modal. Nous présentons la réalisation technologique et la caractérisation des microdisques de GaAs (sur air et sur AlOx) les plus prometteurs en terme de facteur de qualité et volume modal. Enfin, nous présentons la première démonstration expérimentale du régime de couplage fort pour une boîte quantique naturelle de GaAs en microdisque...|$|R
