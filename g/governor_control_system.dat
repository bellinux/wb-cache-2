40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine valves and stop valves which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and governor valves, operating conditions of the turbine <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the governor and stop valves. The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|E

The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Power system {{stability}} simulations are {{of growing}} importance {{for studying the}} operational integrity of modern power systems, especially in developing economies where generating and transmission capacity lead the demand by relatively small margins. The relevant model topologies, i. e. for synchronous generators, automatic voltage regulators (AVR) and <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and the simulation software tools are well established. The MATLAB® Power System Blockset provides engineers with a versatile power system stability simulation environment, particularly where {{the focus is on}} individual units or small systems. In comparison with dedicated power system simulation tools such as DIgSILENT®, the MATLAB® environment features a superior set of advanced data processing and data analysis features. This includes features such as optimisation and parameter estimation functions. The main aim of this project is {{to make use of the}} MATLAB® package in a bid to test an alternative platform with which to estimate the synchronous machine parameters. Conditioning of field data can delay the process considerably, thus the secondary task of this thesis is to solve this issue by ensuring that only one platform is needed for the entire process starting in the field and ending in the modelling and parameter estimation environment within MATLAB®. In closing, the following points summarise the essential aims of this project: • An application using MATLAB® Script must be created that is responsible for importing and processing the data, so it is suitable for analysis purposes. The processing could include cropping, scaling and filtering of data. • Once the data has been imported it must be used with appropriate models to estimate for machine parameters. This will require the use of the Power Systems Blockset. The actual estimation process also requires the creation of an effective cost function, thus a number of different scenarios will have to be investigated before a solution can be found...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{different}} approaches to stabilize a grid-connected wind farm. Due to the environmental and economical concerns, {{it is expected that}} a huge number of wind farms are going to be connected with the existing networks in the near future. Therefore, it is essential to analyze both steady state and transient characteristics of the grid connected wind farms. In this study, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) system is considered to stabilize a grid-connected wind farm composed of fixed-speed wind turbine generator system (WTGS). The SMES has both active and reactive power compensation abilities with high response speed. Therefore, the steady state and transient performance of the wind farm can be enhanced extensively. Wind power fluctuation due to randomly varying wind speed is still a serious problem for power grid companies or transmission system operators (TSO), {{especially in the case of}} fixed-speed wind generators. The wind power fluctuation usually occurs in the time scale of few sec to several hours, depending on the wind condition, wind turbine size, topology, etc. Considering the future energy systems with high wind power penetration, it is essential to emphasize the research on wind power smoothing. However, reference power generation is still an unsolved problem for wind generator output power smoothing, because more energy storage capacity is needed in the case of constant reference line power. In this study, wind power fluctuation in the time scale of minute range is focused, where SMES system with variable reference line power is proposed to smooth the output power and to maintain the terminal voltage of the wind farm to the rated value. As a result, the energy storage capacity of SMES can be made comparatively small. Another salient feature of this thesis is the minimization of frequency fluctuation of power system with high wind power penetration. As the output power from wind farm fluctuating due to wind speed variations becomes large, fluctuations of the network frequency and voltage also become large. As the wind turbine dynamics and governor control systems have the significant influence on the system frequency, effects of different <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> models have been investigated. However, adopting only wind turbine pitch controller and <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is not sufficient to maintain network frequency of the power system with high wind power penetration to the desired level. Though the pitch control system can maintain the system frequency if the wind power generation is in a few percentage of the total power capacity, but it would be difficult when the wind power penetration becomes 10 % or larger. Fluctuation of power system frequency due to large incorporation of wind farm output power to the grid has some adverse effect on power system operation. Therefore, in this study, SMES is proposed to mitigate the power system frequency oscillation caused by wind farm. It is expected that large SMES capacity give better smoothing performance. However, large capacity will definitely increase the system overall cost. Therefore, the optimum size determination of SMES is one of the key points from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness. So in this study, an evaluation method of SMES power rating has also been analyzed. Moreover, the minimum energy storage capacity of SMES unit to mitigate the frequency fluctuation is determined. The simulation results show that, using the proposed SMES system, the wind farm output fluctuations can be decreased, and hence the frequency of the grid system can be maintained within an acceptable range. Wind farm grid voltage can also be maintained to the rated value by the proposed system. Between the two types oftrends, the fixed-speed WTGS has inferior fault ride through capability compared to that of variable speed WTGS. Therefore, fixed-speed wind generator that uses the squirrel-cage induction generator needs additional tool to enhance the fault ride through capability. This is because it requires large reactive power to recover the air gap flux when a short circuit fault occurs in the power system. If sufficient reactive power is not supplied, then the electromagnetic torque of wind generator decreases significantly. Then wind generator and turbine speeds increase rapidly due to large difference between mechanical and electromagnetic torques. As a result, the induction generator becomes unstable and it requires to be disconnected from the power system. However, the recent trend is to decrease the shut down operation because a shut down of large wind farm can have a serious effect on power system operation. In this study, a pulse width modulation (PWM) based voltage source converter (VSC) and two-quadrant DC-DC chopper using insulated gate bipolar transistor are proposed for controlling SMES to enhance the fault ride through capability of fixed-speed WTGS. Comprehensive study is carried out to enhance the transient stability of multimachine power system including wind farm by using the proposed SMES. Two-mass drive train model ofWTGS is used in the analysis as the drive train modeling has great influence on the dynamic characteristics of WTGS. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults are considered for transient stability analysis of WTGS as the type of fault that occurs in a power system is quite uncertain. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed SMES can enhance the transient stability of wind generators. It is also observed that SMES helps not only in regulating the voltage, but also in mitigating the rotor speed instability, thus it can improve the stability of entire power system. It is also presented that the value of compensating capacitor in wind farm can be reduced by a certain percentage from the original rated value because the rest of the reactive power drawn by the wind farm at steady state can be supplied by the SMES. Transient stability has also been evaluated considering stability index. From these results, it can be understood that the proposed controlled SMES can improve the transient stability of entire power system. Considering all aspects of proposed SMES system, it is found that the SMES is a good tool to be integrated with fixed-speed wind farm. Therefore, the integration of the proposed SMES system into a wind farm can be an effective means of mitigating the frequency fluctuations of the grid system which consequently improve the stability and reliability of entire power system. 北見工業大学,博士(工学),甲第 107 号, 0000545124...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuating {{wind power}} {{is due to}} wind {{turbulence}} and is the part which should be filtered out leaving behind the more predictable mean wind power which can be traded in the hourly energy market. The power fluctuations cause the frequency of electric utility to deviate from the 60 Hz standard. This thesis is concerned with estimating the maximum fluctuating wind power before the 1 % deviation from the 60 Hz standard (required by some utilities) is exceeded. To keep the thesis manageable, the scope is narrowed to thermal power plants with <b>governor</b> speed <b>control</b> but no Automatic <b>Governor</b> <b>Control</b> (AGC). This thesis shows that each <b>governor</b> speed <b>control</b> <b>system</b> provides energy storage buffer to attenuate the wind power fluctuations and arrives at the estimate that the fluctuating wind power penetration is conservatively around 5 % of the generation capacity of the utility grid.

Through the research, an innovative method of predicting the frequency deviation in an electric grid with multiple power plants has been developed and validated by simulation. The thesis also shows that fluctuating wind power penetration can be higher when there are filtering also in the wind farms.
