5000|$|In 1539 Dormer married Katherine (née Dallam), {{and he and}} {{his wife}} resided for a time at The Key, a {{property}} which her former husband, Richard Collier (d.1533), had purchased in 1520. It was said to have been [...] "an <b>extensive</b> <b>holding</b> {{on the south side of}} Cheapside, almost opposite Mercers' Hall, in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane". Collier had directed in his will that if his two children died without issue, his property called The Sun was to be sold to establish a free school in Horsham, Sussex, where he had been born, and The Key was to be granted to the Mercers' Company to enable them to pay a schoolmaster and maintain the school. Collier's children had both died by 1540, and the Mercers [...] "had to persuade the widow and sole surviving executor, Katherine, now married to Sir Michael Dormer, to establish the school". In August 1540 Dormer paid £8 6s 8d for [...] "a house and garden near Horsham church", which remained the home of The College of Richard Collyer until 1893. Almost 300 years after Dormer's purchase, as a result of a lawsuit in 1810, it was found that, as the school property had been conveyed to Dormer by a deed dated 10 August 1540, the school was therefore now the property of Dormer's heir at law, but that [...] "it was impracticable at such a distance of time to ascertain who was such heir at law".|$|E
40|$|Medieval and Historical Bindings in a Modern Design 2 (USA) ' {{consists}} of 11 exhibits of varying sizes including eight made {{especially for the}} exhibition at this venue, in 2006. This commissioned exhibition at the Thomas Dodd Research Centre enabled {{the making of a}} number of new book bindings and to assess their utility when seen together. As part of the researcher's long standing interest in codicology, four considerations informed the practice based research which applied and adapted historical binding techniques. These were high levels of strength, complete protection for the text block, easy of display and opening, durability and the use of decorative design rooted in traditional precedents but copies or pastiches. The public was encouraged to handle the exhibits throughout which all stood up well to this incurring no damage. Subsequent inspection under magnification reveals only the very slightest surface damage. The exhibits displayed a wide variety of techniques pertaining to leather dyeing, staining and tooling, gathering and stitching, pleating and onlays, and a wide choice of core and basic materials in order to demonstrate effectives across the four categories given above. The exhibits including three exhibited in Poland and the Czech Republic, then recently acquired by the Dodd Research Centre together with eight entirely new pieces. This collection has an <b>extensive</b> <b>holding</b> of rare books including Scottish decorative bindings and material relating to Robert Hauser, author of 'American Decorative Papermakers', 1984. It was also important for this exhibition for the researcher to only use materials and processes that lent themselves to ease of conservation at some future point.
