These industrious little creatures abound in India: they are so small that it takes eight or ten of them to carry a single grain of wheat or barley; and yet they will patiently drag along their big burden for five hundred or a thousand yards to the door of their <b>formicary.</b> To prevent the grain from germinating, they bite off the embryo root--a piece of animal intelligence outdone by another species of ant, which actually allows the process of budding to begin, so as to produce sugar, as in malting. After the last thunderstorms of the monsoon the little proprietors bring up all the grain from their granaries to dry in the tropical sunshine. The quantity of grain stored up by the harvesting ants is often so large that the hair-splitting Jewish casuists of the Mishna have seriously discussed the question whether it belongs to the landowner or may lawfully be appropriated by the gleaners. 'They do not appear,' says Sir John Lubbock, 'to have considered the rights of the ants.' Indeed our duty towards insects is a question which seems hitherto to have escaped the notice of all moral philosophers. Even Mr. Herbert Spencer, the prophet of individualism, has never taken exception to our gross disregard of the proprietary rights of bees in their honey, or of silkworms in their cocoons. There are signs, however, that the obtuse human conscience is awakening in this respect; for when Dr. Loew suggested to bee-keepers the desirability of testing the commercial value of honey-ants, as rivals to the bee, Dr. McCook replied that 'the sentiment against the use of honey thus taken from living insects, which is worthy of all respect, would not be easily overcome.' ...|$|E
50|$|An ant colony, {{also called}} a <b>formicary,</b> {{is the basic}} unit around which ants {{organize}} their lifecycle. Ant colonies are eusocial, and are very much like those found in other social Hymenoptera, though the various groups of these developed sociality independently through convergent evolution. The typical colony consists {{of one or more}} egg-laying queens, a large number of sterile females (workers, soldiers) and, seasonally, a large number of winged sexual males and females. Periodically, swarms of the winged sexuals (known as alates) depart the nest in great nuptial flights. The males die shortly thereafter, along with most of the females. A small percentage of the females survive to initiate new nests.|$|E

Notoya (1997 b) wrote, ?In Japan, {{this type of}} corrosion is found in approximately 10 % of cases of premature failure of copper tubes. ? Attack characteristically features very small surface pits which are not visible to the un-aided eye, and random directional changes in the underlying copper metal. Attack is rapid.

Extensive laboratory testing has verified {{the development of a}} reproducible screening method to assess suspected contaminants of producing premature failures of copper tube resulting from a very localized form of corrosion known as “formicary corrosion ” [a/k/a “ant nest corrosion”]. This paper provides a historical perspective on <b>formicary</b> corrosion and various mechanisms. BACKGROUND Indoor corrosion failures of aluminum-finned copper-tube evaporator coils, sometimes without aluminum fins, is a menacing issue in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. Of note, significantly from Japanese research, is the conclusion that approximately 10 % of all premature failures of copper tube result from a very localized form of corrosion known as <b>formicary</b> or “ant nest” corrosion. Based on this fact alone, the HVAC industry worldwide has recognized that <b>formicary</b> corrosion, albeit not identified as such in most instances, accounts for many premature failures in copper products. Some geographic areas within the United States have experienced higher incidences o...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ant nest (<b>formicary)</b> corrosion is reviewed. Current theories indicate that attack requires the simultaneous presence of moisture, oxygen and a corrodent, usually an organic acid, such as formic acid. Morphological features are presented using several recent case studies as examples. This paper seeks {{to create more}} answers to this less appreciated phenomenon that causes premature corrosion failure in copper tubes used typically for refrigeration or air conditioning applications...|$|E
40|$|A swarm can be {{described}} as a group of individuals using direct and indirect communication to act without central command with high efficiency in problem solving. For example, the insect society as a whole is extremely efficient due to a sophisticated form of self-organization is based on an indirect communication between its members. This communication is both between the members and their environment. For example the ant behaviour leads to repeatedly finding near optimum strategies in food supply, logistics and <b>formicary</b> construction. Studies of this behaviour have led to the first usable algorithms in the solution of logistical problems, in evolutionary programming and in manufacturing planning and control. A few examples will be presented. This paper will further study the differences between construction intelligence and swarm intelligence and discuss the possibilities to adapt this evolution to systems and problems of construction processes. First considerations have shown that the principles of the existing ant algorithms and simulation tools of manufacturing can be used in construction as well. In case of disturbances fast reorganization of processes can be developed using the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|In {{air-conditioning}} applications {{premature failure}} of copper tubing frequently occurs due to pitting corrosion {{after a short}} period in service and even during post-installation leakage tests and during degreasing and stamping processes. This unusual type of localised corrosion in thin-walled tubes has been described in the bibliography as ‘ant-nest’ (<b>formicary)</b> corrosion. Copper tubes that suffer this type of corrosion are mainly used in heat-transfer units such as evaporators, air-conditioners, refrigerators, condensers, radiators and solar-systems. The morphology of this corrosion is characterised {{by the development of}} longitudinal pits that form interconnecting microcavern channels of random direction that contain porous copper oxide in directional pits. Usually, microscopic tunnels start {{on the surface of the}} copper tubing and progress into the tube wall. Copper tubes used in a commercial air-conditioning system were analysed to assess the reasons for their premature corrosion failure during leakage tests after installation and during their first two months in service. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were the techniques utilised. Volatile organic acids, chlorine and sulphur, originated by the manufacturing processes, were identified as possible sources of the premature copper corrosion failure. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature search}} and a confidential survey were critically analyzed {{to determine the}} effects of water on the stability of hydrofluorocarbon/synthetic lubricant systems and to identify key areas requiring further investigation. Following are highlights from the analysis: Clathrate hydrates are solid solutions formed when water molecules are linked through hydrogen bonding creating cavities that can enclose various guest molecules from hydrate formers, such as hydrofluorocarbons R- 32, R- 125, R- 134 a, R- 407 C and R- 410 A. The four methods for preventing clathrate formation were drying the gas, heating it, reducing its pressure, or using inhibitors. The hydrolysis of polyolester lubricants was mostly acid-catalyzed and its reaction rate constant typically followed the Arrhenius equation of an activated process. Hydrolytic stability improved with hindered molecular structures, and with the presence of acid catcher additives and desiccants. Water vapor can effect the adsorption of long-chain fatty acids and the chemistry of formation of protective oxide film. However, these effects on lubrication can be either positive or negative. Fifty to sixty percent of the moisture injected into an air-conditioning system remained in the refrigerant and the rest mixed with the compressor oil. In an automotive air-conditioning system using R- 134 a, ice would form at 0 C evaporating temperature when the water content in the vapor refrigerant on the low-pressure side was more than 350 ppm. Moisture would cause the embrittlement of polyethylene terephthalate and the hydrolysis of polyesters, but would reduce the effect of amine additives on fluoroelastomer rubbers. The reactions of water with refrigerants and lubricants would cause <b>formicary</b> and large-pit corrosion in copper tubes, as well as copper plating and sludge formation. Moreover, blockage of capillary tubes increased rapidly in the presence of water. Twenty-four companies responded to the survey. From the responses, the water concentrations specified and expected for different refrigerant/lubricant systems varied depending on the products, their capacities and applications, and also on the companies. Among the problems associated with high moisture level, lubricant breakdown was of greatest concern, followed by acid formation, compressor failure and expansion valve sticking. The following research topics are suggested: 1. The air-conditioning and refrigeration industry needs to measure and record the water content and total acid number of the lubricant of newly installed systems as well as operating systems that are shutdown for service or repair. The reason for the shutdown needs to be documented. A database can then be established to correlate water content with type and cause of breakdown. 2. Detailed studies on the distribution of water in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems should be conducted to pinpoint problem areas associated with free water. 3. Research is needed to validate the current theories and mechanisms of <b>formicary</b> corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors need to be developed. 4. The conditions for clathrate formation and decomposition of other alternative refrigerants, such as R- 23, R- 41, R- 116, R- 125, R- 143 a, R- 404 A and R- 507 C, and water should be determined to avoid possible problems associated with tube plugging. The mechanism by which water facilitates or hinders lubrication needs to be studied...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{is widely}} used in many {{applications}} such as heat exchangers, condensers, {{heating and air conditioning}} systems, electricity, electronic circuitry and ornamental parts. This paper reviews the issue of copper corrosion in different environments and applications. Special attention is paid to the influence of relative humidity and low molecular weight carboxylic acids. These acids are present in rain, snow, clouds and particulate matter and contribute about 15 - 35 % of rain acidity. Attention is also paid to copper corrosion originated by formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid vapours. Corrosion product layers (patina) are analysed, showing the relationship between potential and current density cathodic peaks, and models are proposed that show a proportionality factor of the dimensions of a resistor. These results are of practical importance in copper roofing applications. Before 1985, copper was almost universally considered to be a corrosion resistant conduit of potable water, and few instances of copper tube failure were reported. Where unacceptable performance was identified, the problem was usually attributed to reticulation and plumbing systems. In air conditioning applications, premature failure of copper tubing frequently occurs due to pitting corrosion after a short time in service or even during post-installation leakage tests. This type of corrosion is described in the literature as <b>formicary</b> corrosion, and its morphology is characterised by microscopic caverns connected by tunnels. Specimens are analysed to assess the reasons for such premature corrosion failure. Finally, procedures to mitigate copper corrosion are addressed. Pickling in dilute mineral acids (H 2 SO 4 and HCl) is discussed as the most common method for removing oxides formed on the surface of copper based materials during mill processing and manufacturing operations. The use of corrosion inhibitors, such as immersion corrosion inhibitors and volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCI), is a widespread practice to reduce copper corrosion, achieving significant delays in the corrosion process. Reference is made to the search for new environmentally friendly inhibitors for copper and bronze using organic compounds in acid, neutral and alkaline media, and a number of ecological alternatives are reviewed. © 2010 Institute of Materials.
