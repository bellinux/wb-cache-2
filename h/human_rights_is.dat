40|$|This paper defends several highly revisionary theses about <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> Section 1 {{shows that}} the phrase 'human rights' refers to two {{distinct}} types of moral claims. Sections 2 and 3 argue that several longstanding problems in <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> theory and practice can be solved if, and only if, {{the concept of a}} <b>human</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> replaced by two more exact concepts: (A) International <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> which <b>are</b> moral claims sufficient to warrant coercive domestic and international social protection; and (B) Domestic <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> which moral claims sufficient to warrant coercive domestic social protection but only non-coercive international action. Section 3 then argues that because coercion is central to both types of <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> and coercion <b>is</b> a matter of justice, the traditional view of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> [...] that they are normative entitlements prior to and independent of substantive theories of justice [...] <b>is</b> incorrect. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> must instead <b>be</b> seen as emerging from substantive theories of domestic and international justice. Finally, Section 4 uses this reconceptualization to show that only a few very minimal claims about international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> presently warranted. Because international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> <b>rights</b> of international justice, but theorists of international justice disagree widely about the demands of international justice, much more research on international justice is needed [...] and much greater agreement about international justice should be reached [...] before anything more than a very minimal list of international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> can <b>be</b> justified...|$|R
