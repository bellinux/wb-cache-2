40|$|New version : a {{few small}} modification. This article tries to generalize former works of Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky about skew-symmetric cluster algebras to the skew-symmetrizable case. We {{introduce}} the notion of <b>group</b> <b>species</b> with potentials and their decorated representations. In good cases, we can define mutations of these objects {{in such a way}} that these mutations mimic the mutations of seeds defined by Fomin and Zelevinsky for a skew-symmetrizable exchange matrix defined from the <b>group</b> <b>species.</b> These good cases are called non-degenerate. Thus, when an exchange matrix can be associated to a non-degenerate <b>group</b> <b>species</b> with potential, we give an interpretation of the F-polynomials and the -vectors of Fomin and Zelevinsky in terms of the mutation of <b>group</b> <b>species</b> with potentials and their decorated representations. Hence, we can deduce a proof of a serie of combinatorial conjectures of Fomin and Zelevinsky in these cases. Moreover, we give, for certain skew-symmetrizable matrices a proof of the existance of a non-degenerate <b>group</b> <b>species</b> with potential realizing this matrix. On the other hand, we prove that certain skew-symmetrizable matrices can not be realized in this way...|$|R

This method provides the quantitation and determination of the number of gene copies. In our study, we established an RT-PCR assay using the LightCycler system to detect and quantify the Bacillus cereus <b>group</b> <b>species,</b> which includes B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, and B. pseudomycoides. A TaqMan assay was designed to detect a 285 -bp fragment of the motB gene encoding the flagellar motor protein, which was specific {{for the detection of}} the B. cereus <b>group</b> <b>species,</b> excluding B. pseudomycoides, and the detection of a 217 -bp gene fragment of a hypothetical protein specific only for B. pseudomycoides strains. Based on three hydrolysis probes (MotB-FAM- 1, MotB-FAM- 2, and Bpm-FAM- 1), it was possible to differentiate B. weihenstephanensis from the B. cereus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> with nonrhizoid growth and B. pseudomycoides from the whole B. cereus group. The specificity of the assay was confirmed with 119 strains belonging to the Bacillus cereus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> and was performed against 27 other Bacillus and non-Bacillus bacteria.

40|$|The {{study of}} the Portuguese marine ichthyofauna has a long {{historical}} tradition, rooted back in the 18 th Century. Here we present an annotated checklist of the marine fishes from Portuguese waters, including the area encompassed by the proposed extension of the Portuguese continental shelf and the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ). The list is based on historical literature records and taxon occurrence data obtained from natural history collections, together with new revisions and occurrences. It comprises a total of 1191 species, distributed among 3 superclasses, 4 classes, 42 orders, 212 families and 617 genera. If considering only the EEZ and present territorial waters, this list represents an increase of 230 species (27. 8 %) and of 238 species (29. 0 %), {{when compared to the}} information available in FishBase (2012) and in the last checklist of marine and estuarine fishes of Portugal (1993), respectively. The order Perciformes shows the highest diversity, with 54 families, 162 genera and 299 species. Stomiidae (80 species), Myctophidae (71 species) and Macrouridae (37 species) are the richest families. From the listed species, 734 are present off mainland Portugal, 857 off the Azores and 766 off Madeira. Within the limits of the examined area, three species are reported {{for the first time in}} mainland Portugal and twenty-nine records are identified as doubtful. A total of 133 species have been recorded from the extended Portuguese continental shelf (2 off mainland Portugal, 117 off the Azores and 14 off Madeira), two of which are common to the Azores and Madeira extensions. Biogeographically, the Atlantic group is the most important (548 species – 46. 01 %), followed by the Lusitanian <b>group</b> (256 <b>species</b> – 21. 49 %), the African <b>group</b> (71 <b>species</b> – 5. 96 %), the Boreal <b>group</b> (34 <b>species</b> – 2. 85 %), the Mediterranean <b>group</b> (31 <b>species</b> – 2. 60 %), the Macaronesian <b>group</b> (21 <b>species</b> – 1. 76 %), the Atlantic/African <b>group</b> (19 <b>species</b> – 1. 60 %) and the Mediterranean/African and the Arctic groups, each with only 1 species (0. 08 %). Regarding the preferences for vertical habitat, the demersal fishes are the most important <b>group</b> (305 <b>species</b> – 25. 61 %), followed by the mesopelagic <b>group</b> (228 <b>species</b> – 19. 14 %), the bathypelagic <b>group</b> (164 <b>species</b> – 13. 77 %), the benthopelagic <b>group</b> (147 <b>species</b> – 12. 34 %), the bathydemersal <b>group</b> (115 <b>species</b> – 9. 66 %), the reef-associated <b>group</b> (88 <b>species</b> – 7. 39 %), the pelagic <b>group</b> (74 <b>species</b> – 6. 21 %), the epipelagic <b>group</b> (58 <b>species</b> – 4. 87 %) and 1 species (0. 08 %) of the benthic group.

The seven species that belong to the Coelotes pseudoterrestris <b>species</b> <b>group</b> were revised by Wang et al. (2009). Three species of the genus Pireneitega, one species of the genus Platocoelotes will be studied in a future revision of the genera. The rest of the 60 Draconarius species are described in this study, including 26 new species. All the new species were collected during a 10 year inventory of the Gaoligongshan Mountains in western Yunnan by the California Academy of Sciences and the Hunan Normal University: Draconarius adnatus sp. nov. (♂♀), D. anceps sp. nov. (♀), D. catillus sp. nov. (♂), D. curvus sp. nov. (♀), D. duplus sp. nov. (♀), D. euryembolus sp. nov. (♂), D. gigas sp. nov. (♂), D. guoi sp. nov. (♀), D. improprius sp. nov. (♀), D. kavanaughi sp. nov. (♂), D. laticavus sp. nov. (♀), D. latusincertus sp. nov. (♂♀), D. levyi sp. nov. (♀♂), D. longlingensis sp. nov. (♂), D. mikrommatos sp. nov.

(♂♀), D. tangi sp. nov. (♂), D. tridens sp. nov. (♂), D. xuae sp. nov. (♀), and D. yani sp. nov. (♀). Five species are transferred from Coelotes to Draconarius: Draconarius degeneratus (Liu & Li 2009) comb. nov., D. introhamatus (Xu & Li 2006) comb. nov., D. laohuanglongensis (Liu & Li 2009) comb. nov., D. noctulus (Wang, Yin, Peng & Xie 1990) comb. nov. and D. uncatus (Liu & Li 2009) comb. nov. The males are described {{for the first time}} for D. capitulatus Wang 2003, D. pseudobrunneus Wang 2003 and D. pseudocapitulatus Wang 2003. Significant morphological variation in the epigynum and vulva was found in some relatively widespread species, particularly the D. incertus <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> although the males show relatively consistant palpal morphology. Some Draconarius species placement remains uncertain, we prefer to leave them in this genus for now. Gaoligongshan Coelotinae is found to have high levels of species diversity and endemism, and is similar to the species from central and southern China, Himalayas and Thailand. In addition to many species with their own unique characteristics, members belonging to seven <b>species</b> <b>groups</b> are recognized from Gaoligongshan, including Coelotes pseudoterrestris <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from Yunnan and Thailand; Draconarius spiralis <b>group</b> <b>species</b> endemic to Gaoligongshan; Draconarius incertus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from southwestern China; Draconarius lutulentus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from the Himalayas to central and southern China; Draconarius laticavus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from Himalayas and Yunnan; Draconarius gurkha <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from Himalayas and Yunnan; and Draconarius terebratus <b>group</b> <b>species</b> from Yunnan.

40|$|The high species {{diversity}} of some ecosystems like tropical rainforests goes in pair with {{the scarcity of}} data for most species. This hinders the development of models that require enough data for fitting. The solution commonly adopted by modellers consists in <b>grouping</b> <b>species</b> to form more sizeable data sets. Classical methods for <b>grouping</b> <b>species</b> such as hierarchical cluster analysis do not {{take account of the}} variability of the species characteristics used for clustering. In this study a clustering method based on aggregation theory is presented. It takes account of the variability of species characteristics by searching for the grouping that minimizes the quadratic error (square bias plus variance) of some model's prediction. This method allows one to check whether the gain in variance brought by data pooling compensate for the bias that it introduces. This method was applied to a data set on 94 tree species in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana, using a Usher matrix model to predict species dynamics. An optimal trade-off between bias and variance was found when <b>grouping</b> <b>species.</b> <b>Grouping</b> <b>species</b> appeared to decrease the quadratic error, except when the number of groups was very small.

40|$|The {{molecular}} phylogeny of the subfamily Dolichopodinae (Diptera : Dolichopodidae) is reconstructed based on 79 species of 7 dolichopodine genera as ingroup, and 10 non-dolichopodine species from different genera as outgroup. A Bayesian analysis {{based on a}} mitochondrial DNA dataset consisting of 1702 characters (COI : 810; 12 S : 366; 16 S : 526) was carried out. Genital and non-genital morphological characters from a hitherto unpublished data matrix (based on 57 Dolichopodidae species) were used to explain and support the lineages hypothesised by our molecular phylogenetic analysis. The monophyly of the subfamily Dolichopodinae, and of the genera Dolichopus and Gymnopternus, was confirmed. The molecular analysis yielded nine <b>species</b> <b>groups</b> in Dolichopus that were proposed in previous studies using COI and Cyt-b. No evidence was found to support a clade including Dolichopus, Ethiromyia, and Gymnopternus. The genus Hercostomus proved polyphyletic with respect to Poecilobothrus, Sybistroma, and Gymnopternus. The following lineages were represented by strongly supported clades: Hercostomus germanus <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> H. vivax <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> H. nigrilamellatus <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> H. plagiatus <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> H. longiventris <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> H. fulvicaudis <b>species</b> <b>group,</b> and Poecilobothrus, Gymnopternus, Tachytrechus and Sybistroma (including Hercostomus nanus and H. parvilamellatus).

40|$|Oak {{decline is}} a chronic problem inMissouri Ozark forests. Red oak <b>group</b> <b>species</b> are most {{susceptible}} and decline is reportedly more severe on droughty, nutrient-poor sites. However, {{it was not}} clear whether greater decline severity was caused by poor site conditions or is simply due to the greater abundance of red oak <b>group</b> <b>species</b> found on poorer sites. We conducted this study to determine whether oak decline severity in oak-dominated Missouri Ozark forests is related to factors strongly influencing site quality including soil, landform position, and slope-aspect. We monitored the survival of 6606 dominant or co-dominant oak trees for 10 years and surveyed crown dieback on more than 1995 oak trees during a single year to determine if mortality and the presence of decline symptoms were related to site factors. Analysis confirmed that red oak <b>group</b> <b>species</b> had more crown dieback and greater mortality than did white oak <b>group</b> <b>species.</b> We also found greater red oak mortality on upper slope positions and where soils were gravelly and low in base cations. However, the abundance of red oaks was also greater in these same locations. Further analysis showed that if the initial abundance of red oaks was included as a covariate in the model, the site factors no longer were significant effects related to oak mortality. Moreover, we found that frequency of oaks exhibiting crown dieback was the same or sometimes greater on high quality sites. These findings show that red oak mortality is more prevalent on droughty and nutrient-deficient sites because red oak <b>group</b> <b>species</b> are more abundant there. Rather than simply predisposing oaks to decline, droughty and nutrient-deficient site conditions most likely favored the establishment and growth of red oaks following the extensive logging during the early 1900 s.
