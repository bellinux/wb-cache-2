5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we <b>know</b> <b>these</b> entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E

25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its brittleness, and on the handling, crushing and milling it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and coking ovens at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|E
25|$|Pressure varies {{smoothly}} {{from the}} Earth's surface {{to the top}} of the mesosphere. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> to compute an accurate figure.

25|$|As direct-contact {{membrane}} keyboards became popular, {{the available}} rollover of keys was optimized {{by analyzing the}} most common key sequences and placing these keys {{so that they do}} not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not <b>know</b> <b>these</b> tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for the woman to witness {{the flow of blood}} itself; it is sufficient for her to notice a stain that has indications of having originated in her womb; bloodstains alone are inadequate without such evidence, for example, if she finds a stain just after cutting her finger, she does not become a niddah, as the blood is not obviously uterine. If she notices a bloodstain of uncertain origin, for example on her underclothing, there are a series of complicated criteria used by rabbinical law to determine whether she is niddah or not; the woman herself is not expected to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> criteria, and must seek the assistance of a rabbi.|$|E

25|$|In part, secrecy {{was also}} {{maintained}} by the way scripts were written. Performers were given the first two scripts {{at the start of}} principal photography, but additional scripts were written only after Chibnall had observed the actors bringing their characters to life. Once the scripts for episodes six, seven, and eight were finished, they were released all at once—but only to those crew and cast who had a need to <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> three episodes were then shot together. The secrecy campaign did not, however, prevent the cast and crew from trying to guess the murderer's identity. During production, photographs of all the cast members were pasted up in a production trailer, and cast and crew placed bets on who they thought the killer was.|$|E

The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "I love this record—love it—even though I <b>know</b> <b>these</b> boys flirt with images of {{brutality}} (Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio". In Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson described it as [...] "constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days." [...] Characterizing the band as [...] "authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood", he declared, [...] "It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives."

We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous, we just don't <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> {{chemicals}} have never been put into animals, let alone humans." [...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have some better scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>these</b> songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, in {{a seminal}} paper, Minsky noted {{that many of}} his fellow [...] "scruffy" [...] {{researchers}} were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We <b>know</b> <b>these</b> facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be [...] "logical", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures [...] "frames". Schank used a version of frames he called [...] "scripts" [...] to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.

500|$|The Cuban iguana is {{well-established}} {{in public}} and private collections.

Cuban iguanas are listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the IUCN Red List, as is the predominant Cuban subspecies, while the Cayman Island subspecies is [...] "critically endangered". The total population in Cuba is estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the feral population on Isla Magueyes is estimated at over 1,000. According to Allison Alberts, Chief Conservation Officer of the San Diego Zoo and lead researcher in Cuba, among the many wildlife species at GTMO, [...] "The Cuban Iguana is one of the largest, undoubtedly the most visible, and certainly the most charismatic.

500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly <b>know</b> <b>these</b> people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents.
