Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couple.</b> The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

In 2012, this approach was challenged by a same-sex couple who got married in Texas in 2010 where they are considered a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couple</b> under the ruling in Littleton v. Prange. Their petition was originally rejected by immigration, but in January 2013, in a non precedential decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the case back to USCIS with instructions to apply the rules set forth in In re Lovo-Lara, and determine whether the couple had a valid marriage under the laws of the State of Texas. The case was held up by USCIS until the US supreme court struck down Section 3 of DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project was The Story of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couple</b> engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E

Six major themes emerged from the clustered responses of the participants. Couples recognized that they may be susceptible to HIV infection because HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual contact. Some couples perceived HIV as a severe, life-threatening condition in their lives; others perceived HIV as chronic disease that could be managed through treatment and good health care. The fear of negative consequences was cited as a barrier to couples 2 ̆ 7 willingness to receive HIV counselling and testing. Couples perceived HIV testing as having multiple benefits, including freedom from worries and as a motivation to plan their lives.

40|$|Background: More {{and more}} lesbian couples are {{planning}} parenthood through donor insemination and IVF {{and the number}} of planned lesbian families is growing in Sweden and other western countries. Research has shown that lesbian couples report as much overall satisfaction in their relationships as do <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples.</b> However, although parenthood is highly desired, many parents are unaware of the demands of parenthood and the strain on their relationship that the arrival of the baby might bring. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare lesbian and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples?</b> perceptions of relationship satisfaction at a three-year follow up after assisted reproduction. Methods: The present study is a part of the Swedish study on gamete donation, a prospective longitudinal cohort study. The present study constitutes a three-year follow up assessment of lesbian and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples</b> after assisted reproduction. Participants requesting assisted reproduction at all fertility clinics performing gamete donation in Sweden, were recruited consecutively during 2005 ? 2008. A total of 114 lesbian women (57 treated women and 57 partners) and 126 heterosexual women and men (63 women and 63 men) participated. Participants responded to the ENRICH inventory at two time points during 2005 ? 2011; at the commencement of treatment (time point 1) and about three years after treatment termination (time point 3). To evaluate the bivariate relationships between the groups (heterosexual and lesbian) and socio-demographic factors Pearsons Chi- square test was used. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for testing of normality, Mann? Whitney U-test to examine differences in ENRICH between the groups and paired samples t-test to examine scores over time. Results: Lesbian couples reported higher relationship satisfaction than <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples,</b> however the <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples</b> satisfaction with relationship quality was not low. Both lesbian and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>couples</b> would be classified accordingly to ENRICH-typology as vitalized or harmonious couples. Conclusions: At a follow-up after assisted reproduction with donated sperm, lesbian couples reported stable relationships and a high satisfaction with their relationships, even when treatment was unsuccessful.
