5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 14thcentury, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to {{frequent}} Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done. He won a major victory over the united Mongol troops on the Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|The study {{proposed}} a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further {{exploration of the}} Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer Solar System, using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tunnel}} now {{designated}} exclusively for subway service, Mayor Hylan, a former Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee {{who was a}} known opponent of both the BMT and the IRT, supposedly stopped the project {{as part of an}} overall effort to cripple the two private subway companies and promote the plans for the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). It was also reported that Governor Smith, who had a financial stake in the Pennsylvania Railroad company, tried to stall the project in order to prevent the expansion of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad operations <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city. The stoppage was also attributed to the political rivalry between Hylan and Smith, who were both members of Tammany Hall's Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E

25|$|As pioneers, {{they were}} the advance guard blazing the trail through the {{wilderness}} far out on the frontier. They were {{the first line of}} defense against the savages, bearing the brunt of the Indian wars, and courageously enduring the hardships of pioneer life as the typical frontiersmen of provincial Pennsylvania.

They were finally found on May 4 under four metres of snow in a ravine 75 metres <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods from the cedar tree. These four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that those who had died first had apparently relinquished their clothes to the others. Zolotaryov was wearing Dubinina's faux fur coat and hat, while Dubinina's foot was wrapped {{in a piece of}} Krivonishenko's wool trousers.|$|E

The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over , is rural.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} is on Hidalgo Street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden {{is considered to}} be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early Baroque main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later Churrigueresque main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores is <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atrium and near the Open Chapel of San José.|$|E
25|$|Wright {{made her}} last {{trip in the}} spring of 1865, in command of Capt. Thomas Stump, with Capt.

25|$|In April 2012, the {{university}} submitted a revised {{plan for the}} arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station's freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> central business district at Nassau Street. According to {{the university}}, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the extended transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the expanded freight house into a pair of restaurants, preserving two original ticket windows for kitchen views, and using the wooden arrival/departure boards as overhead menus.|$|E
25|$|As a tropospheric cloud matures, {{the dense}} water {{droplets}} may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy {{to be kept}} aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as rain. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, {{a percentage of the}} light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.|$|E
25|$|The Acuera, one of {{the peoples}} noted by the French as part of Chief Utina's alliance, {{encountered}} the conquistador Hernando de Soto's expedition in 1539. De Soto stole corn from the Acuera while camped out {{in the nearby town}} of Ocale. However, extensive contact with Europeans did not occur until 1564, when the French Huguenots from the recently established Fort Caroline in present-day Jacksonville first visited the area. The French noted that at this time all the villages along the middle St. Johns, as well as some <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior such as those of the Acuera, were part of a chiefdom ruled by a young leader named Utina. Though only 25 years old, Utina had sovereignty over forty other chiefs and their villages, and was {{one of the}} most powerful figures in northern Florida. The exact nature of Utina's chiefdom is unclear. He may have been the paramount head of an integrated chiefdom, or he may have been simply the leading chief in a confederacy of smaller chiefdoms. In any case he was treated as a powerful figure by the French and Spanish.|$|E

25|$|Phong Nha Cave, {{like most}} of the caves in this area, has been {{continuously}} shaped by the Chay River. As one gets <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cave, the more illusory the stalactites and stalagmites look as they glitter when bright light is shone on them. The Son River flows into the mouth of the cave and keeps flowing underground, where it {{is referred to as the}} Nam Aki River, then this river emerges at a site 20km to the south near Pu Pha Dam Mountain. The main Phong Nha cave includes 14 chambers, connected by an underwater river that runs for 1.5km. Secondary corridors branch off in all directions. The Outer Cave and some of the Inner Caves have roofs that tower between 25 and 40 meters above the water level. From the 14th chamber there may be other corridors leading to similarly large chambers, but this area proves more dangerous for explorers because of the ongoing erosion of the limestone of the cavern. The Shallow Cave is located 800 meters from the cave mouth, where there is a spectacular landscape of sand and rock. Stalactites and stalagmites jut out like strange trees, exciting visitor's imaginations.|$|E
25|$|The 467th Rifle Division started {{forming in}} the Stalingrad Military Distirct on 14 December 1941. On 22 December the {{division}} was redesignated as the 266th Rifle Division at Kuybyshev in the Volga Military District. It included the 1006th, 1008th, and 1010th Rifle Regiments, {{as well as}} the 832nd Artillery Regiment, 360th Anti-Tank Battalion, 575th Sapper Battalion, 369th Reconnaissance Company, the 81st Anti-Aircraft Battery, 215th Communications Company, 295th Medical Battalion, and 451st Truck Company. After it was redesignated, the division was moved a short distance west to the Volga River area near Stalingrad. It remained there, forming and training under the Stalingrad Military District, until April 1942, when it was assigned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK). In late April, the 266th joined the Southwestern Front's 6th Army. On 12 May, when the Kharkov offensive in the Second Battle of Kharkov began, the 266th was an assault unit and had the most success in its initial attacks. As a result, it was <b>farther</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pocket when the German counterattack surrounded the army in the Izyum Pocket in late May. The division never made it out and the pocket was mopped up between 26 and 28 May. The 266th was officially disbanded on 30 May. Its former commander, Alexander Tavantsev, was captured and became an officer in the Russian Liberation Army.|$|E
