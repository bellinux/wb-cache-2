This list, divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> of three, became known in art and literature as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, was assigned a gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E

The final was contested between the best team from each country, and Swindon played Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 28 May 1970. Swindon were 3–0 up after 63 minutes, when violence started to break out. The match had to be abandoned after 79 minutes, with Swindon being declared as the first winners of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was split}} <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> for the attack. Three battalions acted as spearheads for the 5th Division on land while two more battalions conducted the landings in Imwonjin. This 2,500 man force reassembled and then led the North Korean units south. In the meantime, the 3rd Battalion, 766th Regiment was detached and sent {{on a mission}} to infiltrate Pusan. Paired with additional support, it formed the 600-man 588th Unit. 588th Unit was tasked with raiding Pusan harbor, destroying vital facilities to make it impossible for UN forces to land troops there. However, the troop transport carrying the 588th Unit was discovered and sunk by United Nations ships outside Pusan harbor the morning of June 25, destroying the 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Thirty minutes later, the {{remainder}} of the transports carrying the division began to take off. This wave was divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups.</b> The first consisted of 239 Douglas Dakota and Short Stirling transports as well as seventeen Horsa gliders, carrying the bulk of the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and their heavy equipment. These forces were due to land in their respective drop-zones at 00:50. The second group was destined to land at 03:20, and consisted of sixty-five Horsa and four Hamilcar gliders transporting the divisional headquarters and an anti-tank battery. The final group was formed of three Horsa gliders carrying sappers and men from the 9th Parachute Battalion, who were to land atop Merville Battery at 04:30.|$|E

5|$|At around 1:30a.m. on Monday, 10 February 1930, {{approximately}} 50 troops {{belonging to}} the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles (Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois), stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDĐ, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The plan was for the rebels to split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups.</b> One group was to infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which was to include the external VNQDD members, was to fight {{its way into the}} post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The longer term goal was to capture the barracks, secure the city, set up anti-aircraft guns in the hills and create a strong point around the railway station. They were to dig trenches around it to defend it from incoming colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups.</b> Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{more than}} 5,000 militia {{commanded}} by Major-General Frederick Middleton hurried west along the Canadian Pacific Railway. Middleton split his forces <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> {{and led the}} main column, intending to retake Batoche. The second column advanced to Battleford and then marched south to Cut Knife Creek, with 74 mounted police forming the advance guard. There the column surprised Poundmakers's camp, but the attack by the advance troops failed and the government forces were forced to retreat. After many delays, Middleton finally attacked the rebel capital, winning the Battle of Batoche and forcing Riel to surrender, before relieving Prince Albert on May 20. The third column marched to Edmonton, supported by 20 mounted police and their 9-pounder (4kg) gun, where the government captured Big Bear and {{the remnants of the}} rebel Cree. Riel was imprisoned by the mounted police at Regina, given a short trial, and hanged.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July, Persano {{took the}} Italian fleet out of Ancona and steamed {{to the island}} of Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With the main fleet of twelve ironclads, they brought troop {{transports}} carrying 3,000 soldiers. Persano then {{spent the next two}} days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing. Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and Venice. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack. As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups,</b> with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians. Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with Drache on his right flank; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 June, Skanderbeg {{arranged}} his army for battle. Apart from the 3,000 warriors hidden behind the Ottoman army, Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3,000 {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards. They were divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups,</b> each composed of 3,000 men. They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into a downhill charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and an equal number of infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge. An equal number of archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen. The main body of infantry, commanded by Ajdin Muzaka, was placed behind the archers.|$|E

5|$|The 19th Reconnaissance Group met the German attack divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups,</b> each {{composed}} of a Carrier troop, a troop of the Group's Light Company, and three motorcycles with sidecars. Unable to resist the German attack, after a brief struggle, in which they reported two enemy tanks destroyed, the Greek forces defending Akritas retreated to the heights south of the village. The Germans left a few tanks {{in the village and}} moved in two columns to capture the village of Megali Sterna {{on the one hand and}} the Kalindria railway station and the village of Cherso on the other. Through their capture of Akritas and the heights to its north, the Germans scored a significant success, opening the path to attacking the Krousia position form the rear. As a result, the surviving forces of the 193rd Regiment and the 19th Reconnaissance Group became de facto encircled and cut off by the two fast-moving German columns, as were the companies of the 9th Border Sector on the division's extreme left. Lacking any heavy weapons, these units had no choice but remain in place and await the arrival of the 192nd Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympics {{were held}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{the first time since}} NHL players were allowed to compete that the Olympics {{were held in}} a city with an NHL team. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a {{narrower}} NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 61metres×26metres (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft). This change saved an expected $10million (CAD) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games. Games were played at the UBC Winter Sports Centre and Rogers Arena (then GM Place at the time), which was renamed Canada Hockey Place during the event because corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue. Twelve teams qualified for the men's event and were split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> of four teams. At the NHL's request, the number of preliminary games was lowered to three. Following the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1 through 12 based on points. The top four ranked teams received byes to the quarter-finals, and the other eight teams played for the remaining four positions. Following that, the final eight teams competed in a playoff.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>groups</b> to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
