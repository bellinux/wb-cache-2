Other diseases, such as those caused by arboviruses, are presenting new challenges.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} animals <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to acquire forms of {{communication}} through social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols, none {{have been able to}} learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{endured a}} poor {{start to the}} 1971–72 season, {{and as a result}} Mee {{purchased}} Alan Ball, Jr. from Everton for £220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes. Kennedy scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club's top goalscorer for the second successive season.|$|E

25|$|Since 1298 Norwich has {{returned}} {{two members of}} parliament to the House of Commons. Until 1950 the city was an undivided constituency, returning two MPs. Since that date the area has been divided between two single-member constituencies: Norwich North and Norwich South. Both constituencies <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> marginal seats in recent elections; until 2010 switching between the Labour and Conservative parties.|$|E

In a 1997 review of effectiveness data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found clear evidence showing that toothpaste containing triclosan was effective in preventing gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|Other common host {{materials}} for neodymium are: YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride, 1047 and 1053nm), YVO4 (yttrium orthovanadate, 1064nm), and glass. A particular host material is chosen {{in order to}} obtain a desired combination of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Nd:YAG lasers and variants are pumped either by flashtubes, continuous gas discharge lamps, or near-infrared laser diodes (DPSS lasers). Prestabilized laser (PSL) types of Nd:YAG lasers <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particularly useful in providing the main beams for gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO600 and TAMA.|$|E
25|$|Calvin also {{produced}} many volumes of commentary {{on most of}} the books of the Bible. For the Old Testament, he published commentaries for all books except the histories after Joshua (though he did publish his sermons on First Samuel) and the Wisdom literature other than the Book of Psalms. For the New Testament, he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation. These commentaries, too, <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.|$|E

25|$|Many {{acid rock}} {{discharges}} also contain {{elevated levels of}} potentially toxic metals, especially nickel and copper {{with lower levels of}} a range of trace and semi-metal ions such as lead, arsenic, aluminium, and manganese. The elevated levels of heavy metals can only be dissolved in waters that have a low pH, as is found in the acidic waters produced by pyrite oxidation. In the coal belt around the south Wales valleys in the UK highly acidic nickel-rich discharges from coal stocking sites <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particularly troublesome.|$|E
25|$|Although {{material}} has been recovered {{from across the}} region dating to this period, there have been very few large scale excavations, particularly in recent years. The majority of material identified from East Anglia consists of stray artefacts {{with only a few}} known stratified sites. Norfolk also lacks the cave sites which <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so important for the preservation of sites in other areas e.g. Kent's Cavern, Torbay, Devon; Creswell Crags, Derbyshire; Gough's Cave, Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. The Earlier Upper Palaeolithic is very poorly represented across the whole region although there is somewhat more known from the Later Upper Palaeolithic.|$|E
25|$|Texas has not {{elected a}} Democrat in a statewide {{election}} since 1994, {{and according to}} Rasmussen polling, in October 2008 Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. Texas House of Representatives member/Afghanistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn's Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega 47% to 43%, suggesting that this race might <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unexpectedly competitive. However, most polls showed a much wider margin. Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican Primary.|$|E
