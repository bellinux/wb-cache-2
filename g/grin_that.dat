500|$|In 2007, Paige made {{a return}} to the West End stage {{for the first time in}} six years, as the Chaperone/Beatrice Stockwell in The Drowsy Chaperone at the Novello Theatre. The {{production}} ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Elaine Paige is a good sport... enduring jokes about her reputation for being 'difficult' with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> doesn't seem all that forced.... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening". Paul Taylor from The Independent was less impressed and wrote [...] "a miscast Elaine Paige manages to be unfunny to an almost ingenious degree as the heroine's bibulous minder". For her performance, Paige was nominated for a What's On Stage Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Musical. She next collaborated with the duo Secret Garden in recording the song [...] "The Things You Are to Me" [...] for their 2007 album, Inside I'm Singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You were right, after all," [...] he confessed, with a sheepish <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> sat incongruously on his stern, Indian-like features.|$|E
60|$|The tear-drop trickled to his chin: There was {{a meaning}} in her <b>grin</b> <b>That</b> {{made him feel}} on fire within.|$|E
6000|$|... 'From Thibet.' He pointed {{across the}} hills and <b>grinned.</b> <b>That</b> <b>grin</b> went {{straight}} to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola shook it. No pure Thibetan would have understood {{the meaning of the}} gesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed back to his village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar. It was the whooping of Namgay Doola.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon and Revel's satirical song [...] "Underneath The Harlem Moon", {{recorded}} by Don Redman in 1932 and by Randy Newman in 1970, explains: [...] "They just live for dancing, They're never blue or forlorn, Ain't no sin to laugh or <b>grin,</b> <b>That's</b> why darkies were born." ...|$|R
60|$|With this, Old Man Coyote {{once more}} <b>grinned</b> <b>that</b> wicked <b>grin</b> {{of his and}} trotted away towards the Green Forest. Reddy watched him {{disappear}} and would have given {{anything in the world}} to have been outside the fence in his place instead of inside, where he then was.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} {{afterward}} Stillwell came to Madeline, rubbing his big hands in satisfaction {{and wearing a}} <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> was enormous.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked down}} {{and there was the}} ugly face of Hans wearing a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> might have frightened the man in the moon.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was that}} the good-natured black cook looked behind her young mistress, with a benevolent <b>grin,</b> <b>that</b> only the admirable Leslie could paint.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Was it any {{business}} of ours?' asked another. And another told, <b>grinning,</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the}} famous Captain Freny, who, having bribed the jury to acquit him two days back at Kilkenny assizes, had mounted his horse at the gaol door, and {{the very next day}} had robbed two barristers who were going the circuit.|$|R
6000|$|Old Man Coyote, {{trotting}} {{along on}} his way home, heard that howl and understood it. Again he <b>grinned</b> <b>that</b> wicked <b>grin</b> of his, and stopped to listen. [...] "I don't think he'll hunt me again in a hurry," [...] he muttered, then trotted on. Poor Bowser! Hunting for anything but his home was farthest from his thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The magazine's {{front cover}} on 9 July 1848, with the <b>grinning</b> boy <b>that</b> became its trademark.|$|R
6000|$|... "An' you {{can depend}} upon Aleck, ebery time, sah," [...] {{put in the}} colored man, with a broad <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> showed all of his ivories.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' nebber gwine {{to fight}} no more?" [...] asked Ebony, with a <b>grin,</b> <b>that</b> {{might be more}} {{correctly}} described as a split, from ear to ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drowning comes much to {{the same}} thing; let's do it decently--according to rule," [...] {{retorted}} Edgar, with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> displayed a brilliant set of teeth.|$|E
60|$|The fight, too, raised {{rather than}} lowered Condor in their opinion. The {{men who had}} seen it all agreed that, {{although}} he had not a shadow of chance from the first, he had fought with unflinching pluck, and struggled on most gamely until knocked out of time. Consequently, {{when he returned to}} duty he was treated with the same respect as before, and with none of the covert <b>grins</b> <b>that</b> he had expected to notice among them.|$|R
6000|$|YANK--[With {{a knowing}} <b>grin,</b> {{convinced}} <b>that</b> {{this is all}} camouflage, {{a part of the}} secrecy.] Dis burg is full of bulls, ain't it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What? Oh, I see. Non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae caelestis patiens latus[2].' King's mouth twitched {{to hide a}} <b>grin.</b> 'Was <b>that</b> {{done with}} intention?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Green {{endeavored}} to dissemble his startled expression in a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> revealed his white teeth. [...] "Ye can't forgive me that blunder, Mr. Caryll," [...] said he.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that either coming or {{going on that}} occasion, Ruck, the butcher, stood in his doorway and regarded us with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> showed his long teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kin you do cookin'?" [...] asked Zulu with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> {{revealed}} {{an unusually large}} cavern full of glistening teeth, mingled with more than an average allowance of tongue and gums.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you mean Gillie?" [...] asked Lewis, {{with a quiet}} <b>grin,</b> as <b>that</b> {{reckless}} youth suddenly {{presented his}} blue coat and yellow buttons in the very opening referred to.|$|R
5000|$|As Neumann succumbs to his loss, {{the scene}} cuts to his {{security}} vid-log from Issue One. He says that Marla died 12 {{hours before he}} made the vid-log, {{and he has not}} seen another sign of life for the last six hours. He then states (maniacally <b>grinning)</b> <b>that</b> [...] "They say there are no Atheists in foxholes? Well after this, it's more like the other way around." [...] He then leaves the vid-log recording and walks away, saying to whoever may find it [...] "Don't come looking for me. You may not like what you find," [...] ending the comic series.|$|R
60|$|He <b>grinned,</b> {{and said}} <b>that</b> {{it was an}} {{establishment}} without dogs.|$|R
60|$|Haberton slowly came to himself. He {{looked about}} the room less blankly; then by degrees {{fashioned}} his visage into the sickliest <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> ever libeled all smiling. He {{shook his head and}} looked knowing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear no, Sir! My master is {{a married}} man, and has one daughter--Miss Margaret--who is {{reckoned}} {{a very fine}} young lady, Sir!" [...] And the man grinned as he spoke--a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> sickened and shocked me.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh! massa Richard, maybe a ten rod,” {{cried the}} black, bending {{under one of}} the horses, with the pretence of {{fastening}} a buckle, but in reality to conceal the <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> opened a mouth from ear to ear.|$|E
5000|$|In one {{strip of}} Peanuts, Linus {{challenges}} Snoopy: [...] "Prove {{to me that}} you're a real hockey player." [...] Snoopy <b>grins,</b> revealing <b>that</b> several of his front teeth have been knocked out. Linus walks away, convinced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thief! Sneak! Coward!" [...] snarled Reddy. Once more Old Man Coyote <b>grinned.</b> When <b>that</b> dinner had {{disappeared}} {{down his throat}} to the last and smallest crumb, he licked his chops and turned to Granny and Reddy.|$|R
60|$|At last he saw jolly, round, red Mr. Sun {{drop down}} to his bed behind the Purple Hills. Old Mother West Wind came hurrying back from her day's work and {{gathered}} her children, the Merry Little Breezes, into her big bag, and then she, too, started for her home behind the Purple Hills. A little star came out and winked at Peter, and then way over {{on the edge of}} the Green Forest he heard Old Man Coyote laugh. Peter <b>grinned.</b> <b>That</b> was what he had been waiting for, since it meant that Old Man Coyote was so far away that there was nothing to fear from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dry up {{the army}} touch," [...] said Jim contemptuously, to Robert. [...] "We're all civvies here. We're all right, aren't we?" [...] he said loudly, {{turning to the}} {{stranger}} with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> showed his pointed teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore {{am glad to}} see you, Flo," [...] he said, with {{rather a}} heavy {{expulsion}} of breath. He wore a cheerful <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> in no wise deceived Flo, or Carley either. The young man had a furtive expression of eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mind. Nurse {{says you}} have no {{business}} to punish me! She did not put me to bed; and I had such fun! Oh, such fun!" [...] and the boy looked up with a <b>grin</b> <b>that</b> set all the others laughing.|$|E
60|$|Behind it, two horrible goggle eyes shone {{forth with}} lurid gleams into the blank room. I knew those too, {{they were the}} eyes of the mask--that <b>grinning</b> mask <b>that</b> Kalaua wore as the sign of his priestship.|$|R
50|$|The report {{argues that}} {{adoption}} of Esperanto would save the UE 25 billion euros a year. <b>Grin</b> suggests <b>that</b> adoption of Esperanto {{as a working}} language is unlikely given prejudices against the language, but that such a move may be achieved in the long term.|$|R
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. [Angrily.] Decline {{a seat in}} the Cabinet, and {{retire from}} public life? Never heard such damned {{nonsense}} in the whole course of my existence. I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern. Chiltern, I beg your pardon. [To LORD GORING.] Don’t <b>grin</b> like <b>that,</b> sir.|$|R
