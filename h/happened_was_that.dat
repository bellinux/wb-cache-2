25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in {{his rear}} at Mohrungen. He {{immediately}} called off the battle and retraced his {{steps toward the}} town. What had <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwały), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Count Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under General Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake Marąg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town.|$|E
25|$|Zeno, {{as member}} of the protectores domestici, did not {{take part in the}} {{disastrous}} expedition against the Vandals, led in 468 by Leo's brother-in-law Basiliscus. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed magister militum per Thracias and led an expedition in Thrace. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of Anagastes. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for Daniel the Stylite's opinion about the campaign, and Daniel answered that Zeno would have been the target of a conspiracy but would have escaped unharmed. What <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by Aspar to actually capture him. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to Serdica, and because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.|$|E

25|$|Another {{report was}} that Sam Sneed was beaten {{in one of}} the label's {{meetings}} by a group of Death Row affiliates, led by Suge Knight and 2Pac. According to Daz Dillinger, the reason this <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sam Sneed had too many East Coast rappers in his Lady Heroin music video. Disillusioned with the direction of Death Row, artists RBX and The D.O.C. chose to leave, after which Suge Knight exercised tighter control over the rest of the roster. Dogg Food was not produced by Dr. Dre but was mixed by Dr. Dre, a further testament to Dre's dwindling involvement with his own record label. Dr. Dre also grew tired of Knight's violence within the label, although he contributed toward two tracks on 2Pac's All Eyez on Me. The rest of the tracks on the album, however, were mostly produced by Daz Dillinger and Johnny J, despite Dr. Dre being nominally titled as Executive Producer. Shakur's behavior reportedly became erratic as he continued his verbal wars with The Notorious B.I.G., Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep, and Prodigy, including many violent confrontations with many of those rappers at some points. In 1996, due to the infighting, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to found Aftermath; which provoked 2Pac to turn against Dr. Dre.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis’ spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E

In a TV Guide interview in early 2007, Draper explained, [...] "What originally <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Nat and Alex had a band, and the idea evolved based on that.

500|$|Western {{scholars}} usually consider Hanpu's story legendary.

Frederick W. Mote, who calls this account {{of the founding of}} the Wanyan clan a [...] "tribal legend", claims that Hanpu's two brothers (one who stayed in Goryeo and one in Balhae) might have represented [...] "the tribe's memory of their ancestral links to these two peoples." [...] One Western historian of Jurchens has even proposed that Hanpu was not even from the Korean peninsula, instead what really <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a power on the peninsula ruled the Jurchen tribe he came from, or that he was from the Eastern Jurchens (Changbai Mountain Jurchens) who did not live in the Korean peninsula.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes that}} {{featured}} Rachel's party were acclaimed by most reviewers. Fallon called them [...] "a parade {{of the funniest}} sight gags, most uninhibited acting, and—interestingly enough—most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while", and described Michele as [...] "an acting stand out" [...] who [...] "handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne". His colleague Meghan Brown said it [...] "showed Glee at its best", and added: [...] "The dialogue was snappy, the group dynamic was clean and specific, and the kids seemed like actual kids." [...] VanDerWerff {{also pointed out that}} the club members [...] "really felt like kids, not like miniature 30-somethings", and said the party was the [...] "best part" [...] of the episode. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn's breakdown of [...] "the five drunk girl archetypes, as demonstrated by the glee girls". Harper wrote that the party scenes [...] "left a lot to be desired", and Patrick Burns, the third reviewer from The Atlantic, [...] "waited for the Glee party to get out of control, or for someone to get hurt so that America's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking", but [...] "the worst thing that <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Rachel tried to flip a gay guy".|$|E
500|$|Benfica's first {{match in}} September {{was on the}} 14th against Belenenses. Despite leading the game with 90 minutes played, Benfica allowed the {{visitors}} to score two goals in extra time to draw the match 3–3. Camacho took responsibility for the goals in extra-time, admitting the team needed to be smarter and waste time. The next match was the Clássico away on the 21st; Porto had a five-point lead in the league table, although Benfica had played one less game. Porto won 2–0. Camacho complained of bad luck: [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> one team entered the game to dominate, achieved some control, {{but it was the}} other team who scored. What matters in football is goals, and Porto scored, while we did not." [...] Three days later, Benfica started their UEFA Cup campaign against La Louvière, a Belgian team that António Simões described as [...] "easy". The game ended in a 1–1 draw, with Camacho dismissing the idea that it was a bad result, saying that an away draw in a European competition was still a satisfying outcome. On the 28th, Benfica closed the month with a home win against Nacional, with Tiago scoring the only goal. Despite the fans whistling the team, Camacho was pleased with the performance, noting the opportunities the team had to double the lead.|$|E
