40|$|As {{the number}} of {{same-sex}} parents creating families and raising children rises, the stigma surrounding parent-child sex communication (PCSC) remains constant. Parents serve {{as one of the}} primary sources of information regarding sex and sexuality to their children; however, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent-child sex communication remains largely unstudied. Framed within grounded theory, the primary goal {{of this study is to}} investigate how <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents navigate <b>and</b> enact parent-child sex communication with their children. Through 22 in-depth interviews with <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents who have directly communicated about sex and sexuality with their children, the following four research questions were addressed: 1) How do same-sex parents understand and enact PCSC? 2) What topics and discourses are inherent within <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent PCSC? 3) How, if at all, do <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents discuss sexual orientation during PCSC? 4) How, if at all, do <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents converse with each other in preparation for PCSC? Participants discussed their experiences engaging in and enacting PCSC with their children providing a unique standpoint in <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> specific PCSC. Discussion of the findings are discussed in relation to the similarities of <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> specific PCSC <b>and</b> extant literature regarding heterosexual parent PCSC, the unique experiences of <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents during PCSC, <b>and</b> finally how <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent PCSC can further inform all PCSC research.

5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E
