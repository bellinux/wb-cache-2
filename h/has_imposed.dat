Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that, much to his regret, he is bound by British law.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4billion in 1989 to $2.8billion in 2002, {{and in the}} process Germany lowered its coal use by 46percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750million in 1993 to $240million in 1995 and more recently <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> a high-sulfur coal tax. However, the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.|$|E

Pursuing Garrett is the new sheriff, Gorman Truart (voiced by Sam Babbitt), who <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> a zero tolerance policy on crime. Viktoria (voiced by Terri Brosius), the former ally of the Trickster, eventually joins with Garrett to combat the Mechanists. The game's primary antagonist {{is the founder of}} the Mechanists, Father Karras (also voiced by Russell), a mentally unstable inventor who despises the natural world.|$|E

5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental consent for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} Tillman Act of 1907, Congress <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> {{a growing number}} of {{restrictions}} on elections and campaign financing.

Valeo (1976), which, {{in the face of a}} First Amendment challenge, set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.|$|E

Technological solutions were initially concentrated on achieving massive low-cost production but increasing emphasis {{has been placed on}} environmental and safety issues in part reflecting greater concern in China with environmental issues. China was already a world leader in certain areas such as rare earth elements. China <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> export quotas on rare earth elements, 95% of which are mined in China, citing environmental issues, but has been accused of wanting to force high-tech industry using rare earth elements to move to China.|$|E

25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good memory recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential learning or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the very}} act of conceiving and {{creating}} his city in the northern swamps, Peter <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> order on the primeval natural scene depicted {{at the beginning of the}} poem. The city itself, ‘graceful yet austere’ in its classical design, is, as much as the Falconet statue, Peter’s living monument, carrying on his struggle against the ‘wild, tumultuous’ Finnish waves.Its granite banks may hold the unruly elements in check for most of the time, but even they are helpless against such a furious rebellion as the flood of 1824. The waves’ victory is, admittedly, short-lived: the flood soon recedes and the city returns to normal. Even so, it is clear that they can never be decisively defeated;they live to fight another day.|$|E
25|$|Swindon Town <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> banning orders {{on those}} {{supporters}} who cause disruption, criminal damage or are violent when attending games. There were 29 banning orders {{in place in}} 2006, which was an increase from a total of 11 in 2005. The increase {{has resulted in a}} reduction of arrests at games, with only 22 people being arrested attending games in 2005–06 compared to 39 arrests in 2004–05. Of the 22 arrests in 2005–06, 11 were for public disorder, 5 for violent disorder and the rest were made up of offences relating to missile throwing, racist chanting, pitch invasion, alcohol-related offences and one incident of being in possession of an offensive weapon. 33 Swindon fans were also banned from travelling to the 2006 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The European Union <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> {{restrictions}} on cooperation with Iran in foreign trade, financial services, energy sectors and technologies, and banned {{the provision of}} insurance and reinsurance by insurers in member states to Iran and Iranian-owned companies. On 23 January 2012, the EU agreed to an oil embargo on Iran, effective from July, and to freeze the assets of Iran's central bank. The next month, Iran symbolically pre-empted the embargo by ceasing sales to Britain and France (both countries had already almost eliminated their reliance on Iranian oil, and Europe as a whole had nearly halved its Iranian imports), though some Iranian politicians called for an immediate sales halt to all EU states, so as to hurt countries like Greece, Spain and Italy who were yet to find alternative sources.|$|E
25|$|Svalbard {{is part of}} Norway and has {{a special}} status under {{international}} law. It {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work, but it is difficult to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area, although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government <b>has</b> <b>imposed</b> systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border. A Schengen visa must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway. There is no welfare or asylum system for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.|$|E
