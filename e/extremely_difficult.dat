5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult.</b> This {{helps explain why}} research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.|$|E

5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult.</b> However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to decipher.|$|E

5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible to detect from Earth {{due to their}} small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult,</b> and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of the trail is {{frequently}} bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail to the summit of DPeak.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E

Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to perform.

Fish crows {{tend to have}} more slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

50|$|Naval {{artillery}} in the Age of Sail {{encompasses the}} period of roughly 1571-1862: when large, sail-powered wooden naval warships dominated the high seas, mounting a bewildering variety of different types and sizes of cannon as their main armament. By modern standards, these cannon were <b>extremely</b> inefficient, <b>difficult</b> to load, and short ranged. These characteristics, along with the handling and seamanship of the ships that mounted them, defined {{the environment in which}} the naval tactics in the Age of Sail developed.|$|R
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult,</b> as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E
5|$|Carey's {{actions were}} given mixed reception, with critics and {{executives}} both commending her bold actions towards a song she felt {{needed to be}} heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the scandal further. Soon after, Sony involved themselves further, stripping Carey's webpage of any messages and began trying {{to reach an agreement}} with her. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller, and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been allowed a very limited and low-promotion release, not allowing the song to chart on the official US chart, and making international charting <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> and unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
