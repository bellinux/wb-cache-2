Later that day, Phelps, facing the {{prospect}} of competing in eight events at the Olympics, elected to drop the 200-meter freestyle from his program.

Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night.

Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies. Reid stated that global warming is a reality, and just one proposed coal-fired plant would contribute to it by burning seven million tons of coal a year. [...] The long-term healthcare costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed).

2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E
