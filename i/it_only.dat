5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2).

Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since <b>it</b> <b>only</b> partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
