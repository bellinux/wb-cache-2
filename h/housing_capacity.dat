40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{psychiatric}} and forensic psychiatric beds, supported {{housing and}} {{the prison population}} have been suggested as indicators of institutionalized mental health care. According to the Penrose hypothesis, decreasing psychiatric bed numbers may lead to increasing prison populations. The study aimed to assess indicators of institutionalized mental health care in post-communist countries during the two decades following the political change, and to explore whether the data {{are consistent with the}} Penrose hypothesis in that historical context. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: General psychiatric and forensic psychiatric bed numbers, supported <b>housing</b> <b>capacities</b> and the prison population rates were collected in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, East Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Percentage change of indicators over the decades 1989 - 1999, 1999 - 2009 and the whole period of 1989 - 2009 and correlations between changes of different indicators were calculated. Between 1989 and 2009, the number of general psychiatric beds was reduced in all countries. The decrease ranged from - 11 % in Croatia to - 51 % in East Germany. In 2009, the bed numbers per 100, 000 population ranged from 44. 7 in Azerbaijan to 134. 4 in Latvia. Forensic psychiatric bed numbers and supported <b>housing</b> <b>capacities</b> increased in most countries. From 1989 - 2009, trends in the prison population ranged from a decrease of - 58 % in East Germany to an increase of 43 % in Belarus and Poland. Trends in different indicators of institutionalised care did not show statistically significant associations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: After the political changes in 1989, post-communist countries experienced a substantial reduction in general psychiatric hospital beds, which in some countries may have partly been compensated by an increase in supported <b>housing</b> <b>capacities</b> and more forensic psychiatric beds. Changes in the prison population are inconsistent. The findings do not support the Penrose hypothesis in that historical context as a general rule for most of the countries...|$|R

2500|$|Improvements were begun on the fort, {{in keeping}} with its new role as a base of {{operations}} for the British in the South. The gates and walls were repaired, and second floors were added to several rooms to increase the <b>housing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the fort. The Castillo saw action during the American Revolution mainly as a prison, although St. Augustine was targeted by several aborted expeditions from Georgia. [...] Several revolutionary fighters who had been captured in Charleston were held there when it was taken by the British. [...] The Spanish declared war on Britain in 1779, drawing off forces from Fort St. Mark and keeping the British occupied. Bernardo de Gálvez, governor of Spanish Louisiana, attacked several British-held cities in West Florida, capturing all of them. The only major British operation that used troops from St. Augustine was the poorly coordinated but successful capture of Savannah, Georgia; the city was taken by troops from New York before those from St. Augustine arrived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, in 1861, led to the organization of military forces in Colorado Territory. In March 1862, the Colorado volunteers defeated a Confederate Army from Texas in the Battle of Glorieta Pass, New Mexico by destroying their supply wagons, forcing them to retreat. The Confederates returned to Texas, and the First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers returned to Colorado Territory. They were then mounted as a home guard {{under the command of}} Colonel John Chivington. Chivington and Colorado territorial governor John Evans adopted a hard line against Indians, whom white settlers accused of stealing livestock. Without any declaration of war, in April 1864, Colorado soldiers began attacking and destroying a number of Cheyenne camps, the largest of which included about 70 lodges, about 10% of the <b>housing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the entire Cheyenne nation. On May 16, 1864, a detachment under Lieutenant George S. Eayre crossed into Kansas and encountered Cheyenne in their summer buffalo-hunting camp at Big Bushes, near the Smoky Hill River. Cheyenne chiefs Lean Bear and Star approached the soldiers to signal their peaceful intent, but they were shot down by Eayre's troops. This incident touched off a war of retaliation by the Cheyenne in Kansas.|$|E
2500|$|From 1964 to 1972, {{developer}} Louis Lesser built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls {{to house}} 3,600 students. The [...] campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's <b>housing</b> <b>capacity,</b> making Cal State LA {{the largest in}} the California State University system. Maxwell Starkman & Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. The first on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During 1984 Summer Olympics that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Lesser also pioneered “underground parking”, with his Cal State LA development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper section header, [...] "Parking Underground", which described a two-level underground parking lot as a [...] "concept" [...] of [...] "subterranean spaces". A newly debuted Halisi Scholars Black Living-Learning Community, an effort to “enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues of concern to the black community living on campus by offering the opportunity to connect with faculty and peers, and engage in programs that focus on academic success, cultural awareness, and civic engagement.” ...|$|E
