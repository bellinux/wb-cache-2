He is an important member of the Syndicate, along with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and The Elder, and was a friend of William Mulder earlier in his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried to <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> King. Once Henry knew what was afoot, he acted. Thus {{at the end of}} 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E

5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced to share a room as they <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{communist}} government of the People's Republic of Poland. He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Devil. Favorite was supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a panic attack and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E

5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E
