The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Darwin's wife, a religious woman who disapproved of her husband's theories, is played by Jennifer Connelly, Bettany's real-life wife, in the kind of casting that doesn't always work, but it does here. We believe in the Darwins' history together, their familiarity and affection. Connelly's English accent is also as good as Renée Zellweger's and Gwyneth Paltrow's.

Despite this, he found the game's premise of crushing Velociraptor slightly disturbing, but added [...] "there's just enough fiction to the setting to keep realism at bay." [...] Bit-tech's Joe Martin suggested that though longevity could be an issue for serious players, Off-Road Velociraptor Safari is [...] "unmatched" [...] as a game which can be played for short periods of time. Channel 4 described the game as [...] "a real laugh" [...] and [...] "one of our favourite coffee-break games of the moment." [...] Destructoid's Hamza Aziz enjoyed the game, [...] "it's hard not to love it", but found the slow motion [...] "gets old and frustrating after a while." ...|$|E

[...] Priest asserts that [...] "whoever did it was probably not an expert in radiation protection, so they probably didn't realize how much contamination you can <b>get</b> <b>just</b> by opening the top (of the vial) and closing it again.

During the pre-release of the video, James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video was a [...] "labor of love, for both the band and their director". In a later-published article, he labelled the clip as [...] "dark, dreamlike thing that pushes Amy Lee's claustrophobic musings to the next level. And somewhere beyond that too", further describing it as [...] "both haunting and haunted". While Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the music video as [...] "mystical", a writer of Spin wrote, [...] " [...] features pretty lights and a field of wheat, {{in addition to the}} usual Evanescence fare — frontwoman Amy Lee in pale chiffon and corsets, a fantasy world involving lots of wind and unpleasant situations [...] and dreadlock-banging galore." [...] HitFixs Melinda Newman compared the lightning scenes of the video to the light displays of United States' Independence Day, further adding that [...] "it's all darkly lit and dramatic and Lee, as usual, looks absolutely stunning and haunted all at the same time.

2500|$|Don is {{the older}} son of Alan Eppes and Margaret Mann-Eppes. [...] He {{was raised in}} a secular Jewish family. During the Vietnam War, his parents would take him to sit-ins, and he twice watched his father be arrested (as {{mentioned}} in the episode [...] "Protest"). When Don became too attached to his toy gun, his parents put him in Little League, hoping Don would forget his love for guns. Don graduated high school on the same day as his younger brother Charlie, who is five years younger ("Soft Target"). He went to college on a baseball scholarship and then played Single-A with the Stockton Rangers (a fictional team) as a utility player. Charlie used to predict the number of walks he would <b>get</b> <b>just</b> from his stance at the plate. Despite the attraction, Don never took steroids, although his backup player did. That player made the major leagues and Don has since wondered if he should have taken steroids to help improve his game. The day after realizing that he would never be better than a single A player, Don quit the Rangers and signed up for the FBI entrance exam ("Identity Crisis").|$|E

2500|$|The {{bankruptcy}} court examiner's finding quickly {{led to the}} bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. itself. [...] On April 3, 2012, Dynegy Inc. announced that it had reached {{an agreement with the}} U.S. bankruptcy trustee, {{the board of directors of}} Dynegy Holdings, and its other creditors. [...] The agreement, which affected US$2.25 billion in debt, gave all creditors 99 percent of the stock of Dynegy Inc. once it emerged from bankruptcy. [...] Existing shareholders would <b>get</b> <b>just</b> 1 percent of the stock in the new company, with warrants enabling them to buy up to 13.5 of common stock at a set price over the next five years. Accordingly, Dynegy Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 5, 2012. The bankrutpcy plan filed by Dynegy Inc. also called for a merger with Dynegy Holdings. [...] The bankruptcy filing did not, however, affect GasCo, CoalCo, or the [...] "stub group", and allowed the Dynegy Holdings bankruptcy to proceed. Dynegy's stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange following the bankruptcy filing. U.S. Bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a $540 million claim against the company in {{bankruptcy court}}.

2500|$|On May 1, 2006 {{president}} Evo Morales {{signed a}} decree stating that all gas reserves {{were to be}} nationalized: [...] "the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control" [...] of hydrocarbons. He thus realized his electoral promises, declaring that [...] "We are not a government of mere promises: we follow through on what we propose and what the people demand". The announcement was timed to coincide with Labor Day on May 1. Ordering the military and engineers of YPFB, the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month [...] "transition period" [...] to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, president Morales stated that the nationalization would not {{take the form of}} expropriations or confiscations. Vice President Álvaro García said in La Paz's main plaza that the government's energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million next year, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002. Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil's Petrobras, one of Bolivia's largest investors, which controls 14% of the country's gas reserves. Brazil's Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted by considering the move as [...] "unfriendly" [...] and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia. Petrobras, Spain's Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc and France's Total are the main gas companies present in the country. According to Reuters, [...] "Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, a Morales ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes — conditions that oil majors largely agreed to accept." [...] YPFB would pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50 percent of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies at the country's two largest gas fields would <b>get</b> <b>just</b> 18 percent.|$|E

2500|$|During recording, {{the band}} used a sampler {{for the first}} time and hired many {{different}} musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing [...] "the music to dictate itself". The song [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. [...] "Some Things Come from Nothing" [...] came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was [...] "written and recorded simultaneously" [...] by the group. [...] "The Sound of Life Today" [...] is a 22-second sample of [...] "Some Things Come From Nothing" [...] played backwards. According to Rhys the band gave the track a [...] "really pompous title" [...] so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead <b>get</b> <b>just</b> a [...] "collection of noises". [...] "Do or Die", [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] and [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] were written by Rhys while [...] "The Door to This House Remains Open" [...] developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song [...] "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" [...] which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for [...] "Northern Lites" [...] was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments [...] "lying around" [...] Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.|$|E
