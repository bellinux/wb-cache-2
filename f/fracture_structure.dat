50|$|Monitoring of microseismic events {{induced by}} {{reservoir}} stimulation {{has become a}} key aspect in evaluation of hydraulic fractures, and their optimization. The main goal of hydraulic fracture monitoring is to completely characterize the induced <b>fracture</b> <b>structure,</b> and distribution of conductivity within a formation. Geomechanical analysis, such as understanding a formations material properties, in-situ conditions, and geometries, helps monitoring by providing a better definition of {{the environment in which}} the fracture network propagates. The next task is to know the location of proppant within the fracture and the distribution of fracture conductivity. This can be monitored using multiple types of techniques to finally develop a reservoir model than accurately predicts well performance.|$|E

30|$|Just as {{in field}} microseismic monitoring, AE {{recordings}} of rock fracture {{tests in the}} laboratory {{can be difficult to}} interpret because AE only provides part of the story of rock response to loading. For instance, in brittle and heterogeneous materials {{it is difficult to determine}} the macro-scale <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> from individual AE events because throughout the loading and failure process, a damage zone is created where many AEs are generally observed and the scatter of locations can be moderate to quite large depending on scale of heterogeneities, boundary conditions, and mechanical properties. This microcrack damage zone eventually coalesces into a macro-scale fracture, but the observations throughout the test are often of the individual microcracks that could or could not be directly connected to the main coalesced fracture. This observation is the motivation for using cloud-based imaging techniques to determine overall coalesced fracture location, orientation and roughness. The following will present and discuss a method to determine <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> in a cloud of events and the benefits and shortfalls of this approach.|$|E

30|$|The {{applicability}} {{of this method}} is reliant {{on the ability to}} observe relatively large quantities of AE events associated with a few macro-scale coalesced fractures. This assumes that the observed AE cloud resulted in a coalesced fracture, and not just a highly damaged and isolated grouping of microcracks.

30|$|Observations of {{laboratory}} fracture testing {{by means of}} acoustic emission (AE) can provide {{a wealth of information}} regarding the fracturing process and the subsequent damage of the material or structure under load. A method for determining the structure of macro-scale fractures from a point cloud of AE events was developed and tested at the laboratory scale. An unconfined hydraulic fracturing experiment was performed on granite while monitoring acoustic emissions from six piezoelectric transducers on the surfaces of the specimen. The granite specimen dimensions were 30 [*]×[*] 30 [*]×[*] 25  cm 3. The motivation of the AE analysis was to provide location information for a secondary wellbore placement which intersects the hydraulic fracture to complete a hydraulically connected binary well-hydraulic fracture system. Information gained from the 3 D event source locations was used to optimize the location and orientation of secondary production well placement to intersect the induced hydraulic fracture. A direct method was developed to predict the location, orientation and shape of the hydraulic fracture from a dense cloud of AE events. The predicted fracture plane, which was assumed to be planar, was rotated in both the pitch and roll directions, while an average error of AE event distance between the assumed plane and the individual event locations was determined for each rotation iteration, resulting with a predicted fracture plane in the minimum error orientation. Post-test fracture observations were made and digitized in 3 D space from coring and slabbing the granite specimen. The actual fracture observations were compared with the predicted <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> from AE and showed marked correlation. The simple method of determining macro-scale fracture location, orientation, and extents provided a useful tool for materials that exhibit large and disperse clouds of AE activity where coalesced <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> is not apparent.|$|E

The numerical results provide information about the damaged zone extension, structure and behaviour with good correspondence to in situ measurements and observations. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The {{experiments}} were performed {{by considering the}} upper loose porous media and lower fractured media as a typical structure of vadose zones, and by constructing the corresponding physical model to simulate water flow and solute transport processes in order to investigate water flow features and migration mechanism. It has been indicated that in the porous and fractured complex media, if the lower <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> remains unchanged, the structure and permeability of the porous media offer considerable impact on infiltration processes. Additionally, if the upper pore permeability remains unchanged, the permeability coefficients are totally different, so closed or opened fracture channels have {{significant impact on the}} seepage.

30|$|The {{increase}} in the displacement pressure increases the activation energy of the surface for the matrix in the coal during the displacing process. CO 2 has more contact collisions with CH 4 and will produce more CH 4. The {{increase in}} temperature {{plays a significant role}} in activating the gas. By heating the coal, the CH 4 adsorbed on the coal surface is more easily desorbed, which moves more CH 4 away from the matrix surface in the coal and provides more adsorption sites for CO 2. Because of the increase in temperature, the coal will produce a new <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> due to thermal action, which makes more CO 2 adsorption space in coal. The above aspects cause an {{increase in the}} CO 2 volume stored in coal, and the difference between the CH 4 output and the CO 2 storage capacity will become small as the temperature increases. Analyzing the relationship between CH 4 output, CO 2 storage capacity and time, temperature and pressure of gas injection can guide {{the development and implementation of}} the CO 2 -ECBM project.|$|E
40|$|Drilling of {{galleries}} induces stress perturbations {{that trigger}} damage propagation {{in the surrounding}} medium. The excavation process creates then the so-called excavation damaged zone around the galleries. The prediction of the extension and of the <b>fracture</b> <b>structure</b> within this zone remains nowadays a major issue especially {{in the context of}} underground storage. Since localised deformation in shear band mode is frequently observed in experimental works, the excavation damaged zone can be modelled by considering the development of shear strain localisation bands.
