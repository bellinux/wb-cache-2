5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in <b>each</b> <b>statement.</b> The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E

25|$|Interpreters {{are used}} to execute source code from a {{programming}} language line-by-line. The interpreter decodes <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters {{is that they can}} easily be extended to an interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.|$|E
25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another {{disadvantage of}} interpreters is an interpreter must be {{present on the}} executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.|$|E

40|$|I raise a methodological concern {{regarding}} the study performed by Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler and Fugelsang (2015), {{in which they}} used randomly generated, but syntactically correct, statements that were rated for profundity by subjects unaware {{of the source of}} the statements. The assessment of <b>each</b> <b>statement’s</b> profundity was not based on its impact on the subject but was already predetermined to be “bullshit” based on its random generation by a computer. The statements could nonetheless have been subjectively profound and could have provided glimpses of insight and wisdom to the subjects...|$|R
25|$|Where, for example, ten {{anonymous}} {{witnesses who}} are unrelated {{to each other}} each provide a witness statement as to the defendant's anti-social behaviour where <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> refers independently to the same particular events and where this {{is supported by a}} witness statement from a non-anonymous witness, such as a housing officer, who confirms that residents have made complaints about a particular person {{over a period of time}} then the court may be justified in according the statements a fair degree of weight.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides what is good or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E
500|$|Coakley's cross-examinations {{began with}} an attempt to have the signed {{statements}} admitted as evidence. Veltmann objected that <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> was obtained under duress and was not voluntary. Coakley characterized the statements as not being confessions requiring voluntary conditions but merely [...] "admissions" [...] that had no such requirement. Osterhaus ruled that Coakley could not introduce the statements as evidence but that he could ask the defendants questions based on what each man's signed statement contained.|$|E

500|$|In {{evidence}} of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements {{with the name of}} one author below <b>each</b> <b>statement.</b> They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them. Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The main finding was that there was a [...] "cognitive reorganization" [...] of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant's felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement.|$|E
500|$|Noah Lottick's parents {{submitted}} affidavits in the case, {{in which}} they [...] "affirmed the accuracy of <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> in the article"; Edward Lottick [...] "concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral" [...] of their son. During the litigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Behar in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service, and accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him. Behar was questioned for over 190 hours during 30 days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case. One question was about Behar's life in his parents' home {{while he was still}} inside the womb. St. Petersburg Times explained that this question was prompted by Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories. Behar told the St. Petersburg Times he [...] "felt it was extremely excessive". In a countersuit, Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment. By July 1996, all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed. In the course of the litigation through 1996, Time Warner had spent $7.3million in legal defense costs. The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals quoted in the Time article.|$|E
2500|$|The body of {{knowledge}} modeled by a collection of statements may be subjected to reification, in which <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> (that is each triple subject-predicate-object altogether) is assigned a URI and treated as a resource about which additional statements can be made, as in [...] "Jane says that John {{is the author of}} document X". Reification is sometimes important in order to deduce a level of confidence or degree of usefulness for <b>each</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{applications}} of minimum path covers include software testing. For example, if the graph G represents all possible execution sequences {{of a computer}} program, then a path cover {{is a set of}} test runs that covers <b>each</b> program <b>statement</b> at least once.|$|R
5000|$|The ICFR {{rating is}} {{captured}} for <b>each</b> control <b>statement.</b> Larger companies typically {{have hundreds of}} significant accounts, risk statements, and control statements.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{customers}} paying different merchants {{using the same}} card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara, founders of Diners Club, to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first [...] "general purpose" [...] charge card and required the entire bill to be paid with <b>each</b> <b>statement.</b> That was followed by Carte Blanche and in 1958 by American Express which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later acquired credit card features).|$|E
2500|$|The Church of Scientology sued Richard Behar and Time {{magazine}} for $416 million. Dr and Mrs Lottick submitted affidavits affirming [...] "the accuracy of <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> in the article", and stating that Dr Lottick had [...] "concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations". They {{said that no}} Scientology staff members attended the funeral of their son. All counts against Behar and Time were later dismissed. Lottick's father cited his son's suicide as his motivation for researching cults, in his article describing a survey of physicians that he presented to the Pennsylvania State Medical Society.|$|E

2500|$|The {{debate was}} {{followed}} (only on the Nine Network) by {{an analysis of}} the leaders' performance by the [...] "worm". The worm works by analysing the approval or disapproval of a select group of undecided voters to <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> that a leader makes. Throughout the debate, according to the worm, Latham performed strongly and Howard performed poorly. A final poll of the focus group found that 67% of the focus group believed that Latham won the debate and that 33% of the focus group believed that Howard won. Major media outlets generally agreed that Latham had won the debate, although they pointed out that with no further debates scheduled and nearly four weeks of the campaign remaining, Latham's gain in the momentum from the debate was unlikely to be decisive. Political commentators noted that the 2001 election debate, between Howard and then opposition leader Kim Beazley, gave the same worm results yet Labor still lost that election.|$|E
2500|$|Syādvāda is {{the theory}} of {{conditioned}} predication, which provides an expression to anekānta by recommending that the epithet Syād be prefixed to every phrase or expression. Syādvāda {{is not only an}} extension of anekānta ontology, but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term syād is [...] "perhaps" [...] or [...] "maybe", but in the context of syādvāda, it means [...] "in some ways" [...] or [...] "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term [...] "syāt" [...] should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement. Since it ensures that <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, syādvāda is known as saptibhaṅgīnāya or {{the theory of}} seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as saptibhaṅgī, are: ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{execute a}} command, a {{pipeline}} (represented by a Pipeline object) must be created and {{associated with the}} runspace. The pipeline object is then populated with the cmdlets {{that make up the}} pipeline. For sequential operations (as in a PowerShell script), a Pipeline object is created for <b>each</b> <b>statement</b> and nested inside another Pipeline object. When a pipeline is created, Windows PowerShell invokes the pipeline processor, which resolves the cmdlets into their respective assemblies (the command processor) and adds a reference to them to the pipeline, and associates them with InputPipe, Outputpipe and ErrorOutputPipe objects, to represent the connection with the pipeline. The types are verified and parameters bound using reflection. Once the pipeline is set up, the host calls the Invoke (...) method to run the commands, or its asynchronous equivalent – InvokeAsync (...) [...] If the pipeline has the Write-Host cmdlet {{at the end of the}} pipeline, it writes the result onto the console screen. If not, the results are handed over to the host, which might either apply further processing or display the output itself.|$|E
5000|$|BRAP {{releases}} eight Tentative Statements on Accounting and Auditing Practice. Preamble to <b>each</b> Tentative <b>Statement</b> {{explained that}} statements issued in sequel to these {{would not be}} mandatory in any way.

50|$|A proof {{procedure}} for a logic is complete if {{it produces a}} proof for <b>each</b> provable <b>statement.</b> The theorems of logical systems are typically recursively enumerable, which implies {{the existence of a}} complete but extremely inefficient proof procedure; however, a proof procedure is only of interest if it is reasonably efficient.|$|R
