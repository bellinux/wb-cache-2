Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} the intratester and intertester {{reliability of the}} STP <b>Electronic</b> <b>Inclinometer</b> for measuring lumbar flexion. Twenty-eight college age female volunteers were tested on two occasions by two testers. Pearson product-moment correlations for the intertester reliability were. 72 for day one and. 65 for day two. Analysis of variance was used to derive intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for intratester reliability of true lumbar flexion measurements. Intraclass correlation coefficients were. 92 for tester one and. 88 for tester two. There {{were no significant differences}} (p <. 05) between the means within each tester. ANOVA was used to derive ICC for intratester reliabilities for separate lumbar measurements used to determine true lumbar flexion. The ICC of gross lumbar flexion measured at thoracic number 12 and pelvis-hip flexion measured at the sacrum for tester one were. 99 for both sites. For tester two the ICC for gross lumbar flexion and pelvis-hip flexion were. 98 for both sites. There were no significant differences (p <. 05) between the means for each measure within each tester. The results suggest that the STP <b>Electronic</b> <b>Inclinometer</b> has acceptable intratester and intertester reliability.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{reliable}} monitoring systems to follow the evolution of the behavior of structures over time. Deflections and rotations are values that reflect the overall structure behavior. This paper presents an innovative approach to the measurement of long-term deformations of bridges by use of <b>inclinometers.</b> High precision <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometers</b> can be used to follow effectively long-term rotations without disruption of the traffic. In addition to their accuracy, these instruments have proven to be sufficiently stable over time and reliable for field conditions. The Mentue bridges are twin 565 m long box-girder post-tensioned concrete highway bridges under construction in Switzerland. The bridges are built by the balanced cantilever method over a deep valley. The piers are 100 m high and the main span is 150 m. A centralized data acquisition system was installed in one bridge during its construction in 1997. Every minute, the system records the rotation and temperature at a number of measuring points. The simultaneous measurement of rotations and concrete temperature at several locations gives a clear idea of the movements induced by thermal conditions. The system will be used in combination with a hydrostatic leveling setup to follow the long-term behavior of the bridge. Preliminary results show that the system performs reliably and that the accuracy of the sensors is excellent.

40|$|Abstract Background Even though {{technological}} progress has {{provided us with}} more and more sophisticated equipment for making goniometric measurements, the most commonly used clinical tools are still the universal goniometer and, to a lesser extent, the inclinometer. There is, however, no published study so far that uses an inclinometer for measurements in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The objective of this study was two-fold: to independently assess the intra and inter-examiner reliability for measuring the hip abduction range of motion in children with CP using two different instruments, the universal two-axis goniometer and <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer.</b> A pool of 5 examiners with different levels of experience as paediatric physiotherapists participated. The study did not compare both instruments because the measurement procedure and the hip position were different for each. Methods A prospective, observational study of goniometery was carried out with 14 lower extremities of 7 children with spastic CP. The inclinometer study was carried out with 8 lower extremities of 4 children with spastic CP. This study was divided into two independent parts: a study of the reliability of the hip abduction range of motion measured with a universal goniometer (hip at 0 ° flexion) and with an <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer</b> (hip at 90 ° flexion). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was calculated to analyse intra and inter-examiner agreement for each instrument. Results For the goniometer, the intra-examiner reliability was excellent (> 0. 80), while the inter-examiner reliability was low (0. 375 and 0. 475). For the inclinometer, both the intra-examiner (0. 850 - 0. 975) and inter-examiner reliability were excellent (0. 965 and 0. 979). Conclusions The inter-examiner reliability for goniometric measurement of hip abduction in children with CP was low, in keeping with other results found in previous publications. The inclinometer {{has proved to be a}} highly reliable tool for measuring the hip abduction range of motion in children with CP, which opens up new possibilities in this field, despite having some measurement limitations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method {{and a system}} for assessing the kinematic parameters of distant noncooperative objects. An experimental measuring system was developed using a long distance laser rangefinder, a GPS receiver, an <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer,</b> and a CCD camera mounted on a motorized pan-tilt unit. During the measurement process, the system first establishes its position and orientation in a global coordinate system. Particle filtering approach based on adaptive template matching is used to track a moving object {{of interest in the}} acquired digital image sequence. The tracking and rangefinder data is employed to determine in real time the relative position of the object, thus obtaining its 3 D trajectory and velocity. To enable repetitive range measurements, the tracking data is also used to actuate the pan-tilt unit directing the rangefinder towards the object. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the performance of the system for characterization of movement of vehicles and people at kilometer-range distances...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present study’s {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} muscle activity during leg exercises using elastic vs. isoinertial resistance at different exertion and loading levels, respectively. Twenty-four women and eighteen men aged 26 – 67 years volunteered {{to participate in the}} experiment. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded in nine muscles during a standardized forward lunge movement performed with dumbbells and elastic bands during (1) ballistic vs. controlled exertion, and (2) at low, medium and high loads (33 %, 66 % and 100 % of 10 RM, respectively). The recorded EMG signals were normalized to MVC EMG. Knee joint angle was measured using <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometers.</b> The following results were obtained. Loading intensity affected EMG amplitude in the order: low<medium<high loads (p<. 001). Ballistic contractions always produced greater EMG activity than slow controlled contractions, and for most muscles ballistic contractions with medium load showed similar EMG amplitude as controlled contractions with high load. At flexed knee joint positions with elastic resistance, quadriceps and gluteus EMG amplitude during medium-load ballistic contractions exceeded that recorded during high-load controlled contractions. Quadriceps and gluteus EMG amplitude increased at flexed knee positions. In contrast, hamstrings EMG amplitude remained constant throughout ROM during dumbbell lunge, but increased at more extended knee joint positions during lunges using elastic resistance. Based on these results, it can be concluded that lunges performed using medium-load ballistic muscle contractions may induce similar or even higher leg muscle activity than lunges using high-load slow-speed contractions. Consequently, lunges using elastic resistance appear to be equally effective in inducing high leg muscle activity as traditional lunges using isoinertial resistance...|$|R
40|$|The Ohio State University radio{{telescope}} is {{the second}} largest radio telescope in the United States, equivalent in collecting area (2200 sq m) to a 175 -foot diameter dish. For the past 17 years it has been dedicated fulltime to SETI, {{and it is now}} being considered by NASA for selection as the NASA dedicated SETI observatory. The telescope was originally designed, optimized, and used as an all-sky survey instrument to create detailed maps and catalogs of the radio astronomical sky. For the SETI Program, some re-optimizations are required. Right ascension tracking for one to two hours (depending on the declination) was achieved by exploiting the exceptionally large f/d ratio of the telescope. The feed horns were mounted on a large moveable, rubber-tired cart which is capable of a total motion of 100 feet. The cart can carry many horns, making possible simultaneous observations at many sky directions and frequency ranges. Rapid declination movement and its automation will be accomplished through simplification of the existing braking system, and replacement of older mechanical sensors by modern <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometers</b> and proximity detectors. Circular polarization capability will be achieved through {{an increase in the number}} of horizontal wires in the reflector mesh, or addition of a finer mesh on top of the existing one. The telescope has great inherent resistance to radio frequency interference, due to its ground-mounted feed horns and shielding by the large reflectors of half the horizon. The resistance was recently increased further by installation of rolled-edges and diffraction-trapping gratings on the feed horns. If further shielding should be required, inexpensive side shields could be added to the telescope, making it a totally closed structure on all four sides...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the sensory deficit of partial weight-bearing joint repositioning sense {{in subjects with}} unilateral osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The methodology was developed to incorporate measures made easily in a clinical setting. in OA, local degenerative changes can affect the function of sensory receptors and mechanoreceptors. As a result, appreciation of limb position as well as function may be compromised, Because proprioceptive sense {{plays an important role}} in reflex muscle contraction and stabilization of the joint, functional stability and joint integrity may be at risk if proprioception is impaired. Design: Twenty subjects with unilateral OA of the knee were age-matched with 20 controls for the purpose of this study. The difference in degrees between a target angle of knee flexion and a reposition angle was measured during a partial weight-bearing test. A Dualer(TM) (<b>electronic</b> dual <b>inclinometer)</b> was used to measure the joint reposition sense (JRS) of the knee. Both sides were tested with six repetitions on each side.

The following two methods were compared in a laboratory study: (1) an opto-electronic detection method using the Selspot 1 method, and (2) a new Miniature <b>electronic</b> <b>Inclinometer</b> method. The comparison revealed that, with care in calibration, the two methods display similar torso angle measurements for a large variety of test conditions. Cross-correlation between the angle estimates averaged (rmean = 0. 814) for {{a combination of the}} following lifting variables: posture of lifting, lifting height, weight of load, and horizontal distance. Variation in the correlation coefficient between the two measuring methods shows acceptable positive correlation and consistent agreement in angle trajectory over time at Thoracic (at level 5), consistency was obtained at Lumbar (level 5) and Cervical (level 4) levels. Factors affecting the performance of the two measuring methods are analyzed and {{the pros and cons of}} the method are discussed. The findings argue for the use of the new Miniature Inclinometer since it is inexpensive when compared to the Selspot 1 measuring system, provides direct angle measurements and is an easy to use technique...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{origin of}} the AIS is unknown. Several studies in AIS have shown {{disturbances}} of orthostatic postural control and somatosensory modality. The orthostatic postural control {{is the ability to}} organize the upright position on the earth-vertical, by multisensory central integration, especially somatosensory information. Our hypothesis is that the somatosensory disturbances in the AIS involve change in the organization of orthostatic postural control, around an erroneous central representation of verticality. Our objective is to test, in the AIS, the existence of a disturbance of the somatosensory modality in orthostatic postural control by measuring the Subjective Postural Vertical (SPV). MethodsUncontrolled preliminary study on 8 adolescents with SIA (7 girls, 13. 8 ± 0. 83 years, 38. 8 ± 10. 4 °angle). Test=SPV measurement, vision obscured, head-trunk-members strapped, sitting on a seat, fixed to a German vertical wheel athletic gymnastics (external diameter: 1. 90  m), with <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer</b> that measures the rotational tilt of the seat, with reference to the gravitational vertical. From 45 ° inclination, the subject is tilted (1 °/sec) and evaluates the alignment with the vertical gravitational. ResultsAIS SPV= 7. 48 ± 4. 86 ° with a tilt predominance to the right. It is impossible to realize statistical evaluation in this preliminary study. Our results are comparable with those reported in pusher patient. DiscussionThis preliminary study shows a disturbance in the assessment of SPV in the AIS. Disorders of the central integration of somatosensory modality could explain this result.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and experimental searches are relatively less on sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints. The data found in literature are incompatible. Usually sternoclavicular and acromioculavicular joints considered in total movements of shoulder girdle, {{because it is}} difficult to be measured separately by traditional methods. The <b>electronic</b> digital <b>inclinometer</b> (EDI 320) improved by Cybex Co is a very precise and portable device and it can be used easily. Its reality and reliability at measurements of range of motion (ROM) of limbs was proved, but it was not applied on sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints. Therefore we searched the practicability of the inclinometer on these joints. 40 volunteer university students (20 men and 20 women) participated in our study. Protraction-retraction and elevation-depression movements of sternoclavicular joints and scapular abduction-adduction movements of acromioclavicular joints were measured on both right and left joints. The most suitable position for subject and researcher and location of device's probe was determined for the measurement of each movement. The first results found in this preliminary study which are proposed to form a method were like this: average value for protraction + retraction is 450, for elevation + depression is 400, for scapular abduction + adduction is 550.

40|$|An {{accurate}} and reproducible measurement method for joint motion {{is essential for}} classification of success or failure in therapeutic intervention. Digital goniometry is increasingly used {{as a method of}} classification for knee joint excursion. The reliability of goniometry however remains debatable. Aim {{of the study was to}} determine both intra- and inter-rater reproducibility in degrees, with an <b>electronic</b> digital <b>inclinometer</b> (EDI 320) for active and passive maximum flexion and active maximum extension of the knee joint and to determine the reproducibility of active and passive range of motion. A classical crossover design, with strict measurement protocol was used. Two raters measured 72 knee motions each, in 42 healthy subjects in four sessions. The smallest detectable difference (SDD) was calculated by using adjusted Bland and Altman plots for each knee excursion. No differences in joint excursions between the sexes were found. Passive maximum flexion showed larger excursions than active maximum flexion with additional higher levels of reproducibility. SDDs for inter-rater comparisons yielded: 0 +/- 3. 9 degrees for active maximum extension, 0 +/- 7. 4 degrees for active maximum flexion, 0 +/- 6. 4 degrees for passive maximum flexion, 0 +/- 7. 6 degrees for AROM and 0 +/- 5. 4 degrees for PROM. Intra-rater SDDs showed increased reproducibility by 0. 4 - 1. 9 degrees. We conclude that interpretation of knee joint excursions in clinical settings is with these SDDs. Clinical and statistical differences in research settings within these SDDs are not a true difference but should be attributed to measurement error...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the role of warm-up intensity on both range of motion (ROM) and anaerobic performance. Nine males (age = 21. 7 +/- 1. 6 years, height = 1. 77 +/- 0. 04 m, weight = 80. 2 +/- 6. 8 kg, and VO 2 max = 60. 4 +/- 5. 4 ml/kg/min) completed four trials. Each trial consisted of hip, knee, and ankle ROM evaluation using an <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer</b> and an anaerobic capacity test on the treadmill (time to fatigue at 13 km/hr and 20 % grade). Subjects underwent no warm-up or a warm-up of 15 minutes running at 60, 70 or 80 % VO 2 max followed by a series of lower limb stretches. Intensity of warm-up had little effect on ROM, since ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension significantly increased in all warm-up conditions, hip flexion significantly increased only after the 80 % VO 2 max warm-up, and knee flexion did not change after any warm-up. Heart rate and body temperature were significantly increased (p < 0. 05) prior to anaerobic performance for each of the warm-up conditions, but anaerobic performance improved significantly only after warm-up at 60 % VO 2 max (10 %) and 70 % VO 2 max (13 %). A 15 -minute warm-up at an intensity of 60 - 70 % VO 2 max is therefore recommended to improve ROM and enhance subsequent anaerobic performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether cross-sectional areal properties, calculated from densitometry, correlate to the true flexural properties. Right and left male embalmed tibiae were used in the study. Prior to scanning, the proximal end of each tibia was potted in a fixture with registration pins, flushed thoroughly with water under pressure to remove trapped air, and then placed in a constant thickness water bath attached to a precision indexer. Two sets of three scans of the entire tibia were taken with an Hologic QDR 1000 /W densitometer at rotations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees about the tibia long axis. An aluminum step phantom and a bone step phantom, machined from bovine cortical bone, were also in the bath and scanned separately. Pixel attenuation data from the two sets of scans were averaged to reduce noise. Pixel data from the high energy beam were then converted to equivalent thicknesses using calibration equations. Cross-sectional areal properties (centroid, principal area moments and principal angle) along the length were computed from the three registered scans using methods developed in our laboratory. Flexural rigidities. Four strain gages were bonded around the circumference of each of 5 cross-sections encompassing the entire diaphysis. A known transverse load was then applied to the distal end and the bone was rotated 360 degrees in eight increments of 45 degrees each. Strains from the eight orientations were analyzed along with the known applied bending moments at each section to compute section centroids, curvatures, principal flexural rigidities and principal angle. Reference axes between the two methods were maintained within +/- 0. 5 degrees using an <b>electronic</b> <b>inclinometer.</b> Principal angles (flexural - areal) differed by - 2. 0 +/- 4. 0 degrees, and 1. 0 +/- 2. 5 degrees for the right and left tibia, respectively. Section principal flexural rigidities were highly correlated to principal areal moments (right: r(sup 2) = 0. 997; left: r(sup 2) = 0. 978) indicating a nearly constant effective flexural modulus. Right and left tibia exhibited a very high degree of symmetry when comparing either flexural or areal properties.
