25|$|Originally, Gmail, Google Docs and Picasa had {{separate}} {{allowances for}} <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> and a shared allowance for purchased storage. Between April 2012 and May 2013, Google Drive and Google+ Photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage, whereas Gmail had a separate 10 GB storage limit, which increased to 25 GB on {{the purchase of}} any storage plan.|$|E
25|$|While {{the design}} of the FAT file system does not cause any {{organizational}} overhead in disk structures or reduce the amount of <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> space with increased amounts of fragmentation, as it occurs with external fragmentation, the time required to read and write fragmented files will increase as the operating system will have to follow the cluster chains in the FAT (with parts having to be loaded into memory first in particular on large volumes) and read the corresponding data physically scattered over the whole medium reducing chances for the low-level block device driver to perform multi-sector disk I/O or initiate larger DMA transfers, thereby effectively increasing I/O protocol overhead as well as arm movement and head settle times inside the disk drive. Also, file operations will become slower with growing fragmentation as it takes increasingly longer for the operating system to find files or free clusters.|$|E
50|$|SVS {{provides}} a CCW translation service {{as part of}} the Execute Channel Program (EXCP) SVC. EXCP will do any necessary page fixing, allocate storage for IDA lists, translate virtual addresses to real, put the translated addresses into the appropriate IDA words and put the real addresses of the IDA lists into the translated CCW's. When an I/O completes, EXCP reverses the process, <b>freeing</b> <b>storage</b> and translating status back into virtual.|$|R
5000|$|Storage {{violation}} can, for instance, {{consist of}} reading from, writing to, or <b>freeing</b> <b>storage</b> not {{owned by the}} task.

It can also refer to attempted modification of memory [...] "owned" [...] by another thread where there is incomplete (or no) memory protection.|$|R

500|$|A September 2008 New York Post article {{reported}} that Rangel {{had been using}} a House parking garage as <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> space for his Mercedes-Benz for years, in apparent violation of Congressional rules. Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, free parking (here, worth $290 a month) is considered imputed income, and must be declared on tax returns. [...] In July 2010 the House Ethics Committee ruled that Rangel had committed no violation, since in practice the parking policy was only applied to Congressional staff and not to members themselves.|$|E

2500|$|A {{review by}} Michael Muchmore of PC Magazine in February 2016 praised the service as [...] "truly impressive" [...] in {{creating}} and editing files, describing its features as [...] "leading" [...] in office-suite collaboration. He added that [...] "Compatibility is rarely an issue", with importing and exporting options, {{and that the}} <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> of 15gigabytes was [...] "generous". However, he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate, and wrote that [...] "Offline editing isn't simple".|$|E

5|$|All {{versions}} of Perl do automatic data-typing and automatic memory management. The interpreter knows {{the type and}} storage requirements of every data object in the program; it allocates and <b>frees</b> <b>storage</b> for them as necessary using reference counting (so it cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention). Legal type conversions — for example, conversions from number to string — are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.|$|R

2500|$|At launch, Gmail had {{an initial}} storage {{capacity}} offer of 1gigabyte per user, {{a significantly higher}} amount than competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15gigabytes of <b>free</b> <b>storage.</b> Users can receive emails up to 50megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a [...] "conversation view" [...] similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among website developers for its pioneering use of Ajax.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} storage {{available}} has changed several times. Initially, the service provided 7 GB of storage and, for one year, an additional 3 GB of <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> to students. Users who {{signed up to}} OneDrive prior to April 22, 2012 were able to opt-in for a limited time offer of 25 GB of <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> upgrade. The service is built using HTML5 technologies, and files up to 300 MB can be uploaded via drag and drop into the web browser, or up to 10 GB via the OneDrive desktop application for Microsoft Windows and OS X. From September 23, 2013 onwards, in addition to 7 GB of <b>free</b> <b>storage</b> (or 25 GB for users eligible for the free upgrade), power users who required more storage could choose from one of four premium storage plans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A storage {{management}} scheme is described {{that supports the}} invalidation of addresses to <b>freed</b> <b>storage</b> and thus, in that sense, provides a secure system. Unlike previous virtual memory techniques, the allocated areas of our scheme can vary from the very large, requiring multiple pages of storage, to the very small, in which several can be contained on a single page. Special treatment is accorded procedure activation storage so as to provide increased effectiveness for this important case. The interaction of this deletion scheme with garbage collection techniques is also examined. Finally, the relative advantages of retention and deletion strategies of {{storage management}} are considered...|$|R
