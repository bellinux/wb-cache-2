40|$|The {{key role}} of ATP, a purine nucleotide, in the {{conversion}} of chemical energy into mechanical work by myocardial tissue is well established (1, 2). The requirement for purine nucleotides has also been demonstrated in the multiple synthetic reactions which maintain all animal cells in the steady state. Since the question immediately arises whether the purine nucleotides are themselves in a steady state, in which their rates of synthesis equal their rates of degradation, it seems reason-able to investigate first what mechanisms of syn-thesis and degradation may be operative. At present, there are three known pathways for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. The first is the synthesis de novo of the purine ring from small molecular weight precursors, such as glycine, formate, CO 2, glutamine and aspartic acid (3). The initial steps in this synthesis (4, 5) are as follows: 1. Ribose- 5 -phosphate + ATP 3 -> 5 -Phospho-ribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) + AMP. 2. PRPP + glutamine [...] 5 -phosphoribosyla-mine (PRA) + glutamic acid. 3. PRA + glycine + ATP- * glycinamide ribo-tide + ADP + Pi. Glycinamide ribotide is converted to formyl gly-cinamide ribotide and then {{through a series of}} steps to adenylic and <b>guanylic</b> <b>acids</b> (6). The second pathway available for the synthesis of nucleotides is via the condensation of a free pu-rine base with PRPP (7) ...|$|R

40|$|Part I: The {{leaves of}} nec rd (a single gene {{necrotic}} maize mutant) become necrotic {{when they are}} exposed to light for a few days. Extensive analysis has failed to reveal any difference in chemical composition between leaves of normal plants and of homozygous nec rd plants before any necrotic symptoms are visible (prenecrotic leaves). Treatment of nec rd seedlings with various metabolites (B vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, etc.) did not prevent the appearance of necrosis. The rate of photosynthesis of prenecrotic leaves is normal at low light intensities but 20 to 50 % of normal at saturating light intensity. C 14 O 2 feeding experiments indicate that the carbon fixing reactions function normally in the mutant. Hill reaction rates are also similar in mutant and normal plants, as is the metabolism of labelled inorganic phosphate. CMU, which specifically inhibits photosynthesis to the extent of about 90 %, delays the onset of visible necrotic damage and reduces the severity of subsequent necrotic symptoms. It is suggested that the nec rd lesion is in some reaction associated with photosynthesis and that it causes the accumulation of one or more toxic substances. These lower rate of photosynthesis and damage cell membranes. The necrotic phenotype would appear {{to be the result of}} the breakdown of cell compartmentalization. Part II: The kinin, 6 -benzylaminopurine (benzyladenine), is converted to a number of low molecular weight materials by senescing leaves of Xanthium pensylvanicum Wall. (cocklebur). A major product is the riboside, benzyladenosine, which has been identified by comparison of its properties with those of benzyladenylic synthesized enzymatically using E. coli nucleoside phosphorylase and by degradative studies. The ribotide, benzyladenylic acid, also appears to be present. Labelled adenylic, <b>guanylic</b> and inosinic <b>acids</b> are produced, as are small amounts of adenine and guanine. Substantial amounts of label are also found in urea and in a ureide. Small amounts of labelled adenylic and <b>guanylic</b> <b>acids</b> are found in the RNA of the leaf, but benzyladenylic acid itself does not appear to be incorporated into RNA in measurable amounts. Part III: Low molecular weight material obtained from excised accessory glands of Pontania pacifica (gall-wasp) promotes the growth of Pontania galls on Salix alba (willow). Paper chromatographic analysis has indicated that uridine, uric acid and two unidentified adenine containing compounds are prominent constituents of this mixture. Uric acid and the two adenine containing compounds substantially increase the growth rate of small galls from which the larva has been removed while uridine has slight growth promoting activity. Various related compounds (e. g. adenosine, adenine and guanosine) also have growth-promoting activity. It appears likely that such compounds play an important role in the growth and development of Pontania galls...|$|R

In the amorphous form of RNA both residues had the same pK, whereas in the double-helical form ionization was suppressed. The fraction of guanine and uracil residues in amorphous segments may be estimated from the titration curves. The difference in the denaturation spectrum of adenine [...] uracil and guanine [...] cytosine base pairs at 280 mμ was enhanced in acidic solutions whereas E 260 was hardly affected.

40|$|Cytoplasmic capping is catalyzed by {{a complex}} that {{contains}} capping enzyme (CE) and a kinase that converts RNA with a 5 '-monophosphate {{end to a}} 5 ' diphosphate for subsequent addition of <b>guanylic</b> <b>acid</b> (GMP). We identify the proline-rich C-terminus as a new domain of CE that is required for its participation in cytoplasmic capping, and show the cytoplasmic capping complex assembles on Nck 1, an adapter protein with functions in translation and tyrosine kinase signaling. Binding is specific to Nck 1 and is independent of RNA. We show by sedimentation and gel filtration that Nck 1 and CE are together in a larger complex, that the complex can assemble in vitro on recombinant Nck 1, and Nck 1 knockdown disrupts {{the integrity of the}} complex. CE and the 5 ' kinase are juxtaposed by binding to the adjacent domains of Nck 1, and cap homeostasis is inhibited by Nck 1 with inactivating mutations in each of these domains. These results identify a new domain of CE that is specific to its function in cytoplasmic capping, and a new role for Nck 1 in regulating gene expression through its role as the scaffold for assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex...|$|E
