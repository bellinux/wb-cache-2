5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Lindwall gained his Leaving Certificate. This {{made him}} {{eligible}} to study at university, but this clashed with his desire to play sport and earn money to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> his parentless family. He thus took an office job with Commercial Steel and Forge Company, which manufactured aeroplane parts and bomb fuses. During the 1939–40 season, Lindwall's bowling was only moderately successful, with 16 wickets at 34.93. A highlight of the season was an unbeaten 49 as St. George won the grade final.|$|E

5|$|The Goathouse Refuge in Pittsboro, North Carolina, is {{a nonprofit}} no-kill animal {{sanctuary}} for cats that is run on a volunteer-basis. The refuge is cage-free so the cats can freely roam around {{within the boundaries of}} the property. Founded in 2007 by Italian-born artist Siglinda Scarpa, the refuge can hold up to 300 cats on a 16-acre farm. There is an art gallery located {{on the first floor of}} the house where Scarpa sells her handmade art such as pottery, sculptures, and cookware to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> the refuge.|$|E
5|$|Two senior nobles {{stood out}} as {{candidates}} to head Henry's regency government. The first was William, who, although elderly, was renowned {{for his personal}} loyalty and could <b>help</b> <b>support</b> the war with his own men and material. The second was Ranulf de Blondeville, the Earl of Chester {{and one of the}} most powerful loyalist barons. William diplomatically waited until both Guala and Ranulf had requested him to take up the post before assuming power. William then appointed des Roches to be Henry's guardian, freeing himself up to lead the military effort.|$|E
5|$|All leaders work as unpaid volunteers, {{of which}} there are around 120,000. In {{addition}} to this number, the association employs 198 full-time and part-time staff to support the work of its adult volunteers. Senior volunteers in The Scout Association are called 'Commissioners'. Every County/Area/Region and District is headed by a Commissioner who is responsible for ensuring the Districts/Groups under their jurisdiction meet the standards set by the association. They receive support from Regional Development Officers in England, who are employed by the Regional Development Service and deployed locally to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> the association's objectives. Commissioners in the other nations receive support from Field Commissioners, employed and directed differently. District Commissioners report to the County/Area/Regional Commissioner, who in turn report to the UK Chief Commissioner.|$|E

5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, aged 14, Paranhos {{was sent}} to the Imperial capital, Rio de Janeiro, to {{continue}} his studies. At the beginning of the following year he was admitted into the Naval Academy. To <b>help</b> <b>support</b> his education, Paranhos tutored his classmates. In 1841, when he was 22, he graduated with the rank of midshipman, enrolling in the Army's Military Academy. He pursued a course in engineering and developed a penchant for mathematics. Prior to graduation from the Army Academy, he was promoted to second lieutenant in the Navy and became a substitute teacher in the Naval Academy. In 1842, he married Teresa de Figueiredo Faria, whose family had also come from Porto in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E

In an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, his sister recalled Christmas holidays when their mother told them there wouldn't be any gifts. Tessa opened their home to foster children, instilling in Newsom the importance of public service. His father's finances were strapped in part because of his tendency to give away his earnings. Newsom worked several jobs in high school to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{stationary}} weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, {{which led to the}} loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States, and Europe. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to <b>help</b> <b>support</b> the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E
