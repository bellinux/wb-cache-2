Our agent-based model specifically sheds light on the 1 correlation between the endogenous economic cycle and the trade-off between sharing risk and systemic risk. The purpose of the model is thus to determine whether the linear relationship proposed by Allen and Gale (2000) ceases to be valid during certain periods of the economic cycle. 2...|$|E

40|$|We {{design an}} {{infrastructure}} experiment in Mexico {{to evaluate the}} impact of street pavement on housing values and household outcomes. We find that the provision of street pavement raises housing values by 16 % and land values by 54 %, according to professional appraisals. Using homeowner valuations, we estimate the impact of pavement on housing values to be 25 %. At the household level, street paving increased the use of collateral-based credit and average loan size. Additionally, among households on paved streets vehicle ownership went up by 40 %, {{while the number of}} durable goods augmented by 12 % as a result of pavement. We provide compelling evidence that the mechanism explaining the durable goods increase is the credit channel: the raise in durable goods as well as in credit use was only present among households with access to financial services at baseline. This suggests that increments in the value of collateral are not sufficient to expand credit use in this context. Access to the financial sector is necessary for street pavement to be reflected in higher consumption of durable goods. Finally, we estimate the private gains to land plots on paved streets to be 109 % of construction costs, which can have important implications for urban infrastructure financing. randomized controlled trial, street pavement, home values, durable <b>goods,</b> <b>credit...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stylized, small, open economy macro model that incorporates an explicit and non-trivial role for financial intermediation. It illustrates {{how such a}} model {{could be used for}} policy analysis in an emerging market economy where policymakers are concerned about risks associated with rapid credit growth, financial dollarization, and foreign borrowing, while lacking traditional tools to effect monetary policy transmission, and hence could resort to more direct instruments, such as foreign exchange market intervention and regulatory and administrative measures. Calibrating the model to a stylized emerging European economy, the paper simulates real and financial sector implications of various external and policy-related shocks that could be used as input for monetary policy making.

30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} effects to FFL offer and the PR offer. First, consumers carrying more high interest balance prefer {{to accept the}} PR offer even with an increased PR, but the probability of choosing the FFL offer declines. Second, {{the total number of}} credit cards holds by consumer gives an impact on the choice in an opposite manner. The more cards the consumers have, the lower the probability of choosing the FFL offer. However, the probability of choosing the PR offer increases if consumers have more cards. This result is consistent with the card limits and the consumers’ credit records. Usually, consumers with <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> records have more cards with higher credit limits because credit card companies send them credit card offers based on their credit records. Therefore, consumers with <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> records tend to choose PR offers {{to take full advantage of}} BT offers. Finally, our finding is confirmed by a finance charge. Consumers who need to pay a higher finance charge prefer the FFL offer but decrease probability of choosing the PR offer. Overall, consumers with <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> records take advantage of the PR offer. In contrast, constrained consumers choose the FFL offer in order to enjoy the low interest rate comparing to regular purchase rate. Consumers who choose both offers have <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> records but also high finance charges.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the {{container}} became the dominant unit and driver {{of change in}} world-wide freight transport, the optimal utilization of container capacities has become a key challenge of the supply chain management. Fragments of customer orders often arrive to the final destination via different, sub-optimal routes which impose increased delivery times, costs and CO 2 emissions to the global supply chain. This work describes how cloud computing is an enabler for addressing the issue of dynamic and synchro-modal container consolidation at the Piraeus Container Terminal, the fastest growing port in Europe according to recent studies. A significant barrier to an efficient container consolidation at port terminals is the reduced visibility and information exchange between related stakeholders on real-time location and status of a container and its contents. This {{is due to a}} multitude of reasons: the lack of a common standard for information exchange, competition matters, absence of trusted service providers collecting data, information shared on a next carrier basis without disseminating information to the rest stakeholders. Well-defined trigger points on standard routes may be reported by the carriers (e. g. arrival and shipment of <b>goods,</b> <b>credit</b> releases) and will allow for better monitoring of shipments and introduction of Key Performance Indicators for route evaluation and carrier performance. This work proposes a cloud-based information portal as an ICT enabling technology used as a single point of reference by supply chain stakeholders; the latter will use this portal to feed it with real-time information from existing platforms so that a better visibility for all parties is enabled. This portal will implement accessible interfaces with parties of each step of the transport process (e. g. interface with the customer, warehouse, next-leg carrier) using standardized formats as far as possible. It will allow for a flexible parameterization per customer and for a straightforward incorporation of regional special requirements, as is the constraint of single customer per container applicable in some countries. This portal will permit a better visibility level for end-customers, promote standardization of logistics processes, offer an increased profitability for cloud services providers, improve their activities expansion, as well as accelerate customs process handling. Nevertheless, even though cloud technology is mature enough, the trust level of stakeholders in security and reliability of such solutions needs to increase for a wide deployment...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe broader {{conception}} of poverty as ‘quality of social reproduction’ demonstrates the delicate {{nature of the}} interaction between the institutions of the family/household, the economy and the state. These institutions interact in the dispensation of individual, productive and collective consumptions important for social well-being and social reproduction in society. The gap in the configuration of these consumptions relationship opens the space for the institution of micro-credits to thrive in South Africa to the detriment of adequate ‘quality of social reproduction’ especially for people living in ‘poverty range’ or ‘precarious prosperity’. The lack of comprehensive social policy regime provides the recipe for the consumption of micro-credit at the desperate, need and choice dimensions, in order to close the gap between income and consumption needs to facilitate social reproduction of concerned family/households. Micro-credit consumption is viewed as an individual response, in the absence of collective consumption in the form of social policy, to smoothen individual consumption, and to cater for the strain or challenges of social reproduction. The implications of this, for concerned family/households, are imperative to how poverty is perceived, hence, the question ‘the lords of poverty’? In addition to the income and expenditure {{conception of}} poverty, the understanding of poverty dynamics will be enriched by engaging with the method through which the poor and ‘precarious prosperous’ (people living within ‘poverty range’) respond to the gap between their income and expenditure to finance shortfalls in their consumption needs. The relief sought from micro-credit (the focus of this study) to finance the gap in consumption needs can alleviate poverty, {{and at the same time}} perpetuates it through chronic indebtedness. The patronage of micro-credit in the form of cash loan, retail <b>goods</b> <b>credit</b> and informal micro-credit in the way people living within the ‘poverty range’ live their lives, as well as the activities of micro-credit institutions are highlighted in this study. Consumer credit consumption has become such a permanent feature of the social reproduction efforts of individual households in South Africa that it is crucial to understand the broader institutional interaction that may account for this. Further, it is important to understand how the patronage of consumer credit impact on the need that prompted it in the first place and other implications that may speak to the quality of social reproduction of households. These are the core problematics that are engaged in this study. The relationship between poverty (as well-being) and the consumption of micro-credit is considered within the broader framework of political economy. The effects of predatory institutions, such as microcredit, could be significant for the quality of social reproduction of households...|$|E
