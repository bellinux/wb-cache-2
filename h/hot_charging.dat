The microstructure evolution of Nb containing steel during <b>hot</b> <b>charging</b> process was investigated by simulation with a HT- 1600 pipe furnace. The {{results indicate that the}} microstructure varied from γ→γ+α→α+P with the charging temperature decrease from 950 ℃ to room temperature, and the duplex phase of austenite and ferrite appeared at 750 ℃. Microstructure of the specimen at the beginning of rough rolling is austenite and the grain size is similar when the reheated temperature is above 850 ℃. Furthermore, severe mixed grain structure with coarse grain is apparent during the <b>hot</b> <b>charging</b> temperature from 750 ℃ to 650 ℃.

40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical heating furnaces. Heat transfer models for continuous heating furnaces, batch-type heating furnaces, and regenerative heating furnaces are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and regenerative heating furnaces are derived. Then the influences of such factors as <b>hot</b> <b>charging,</b> gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by thermal value equations. The results show that thermal value rises with <b>hot</b> <b>charging</b> and air preheating for continuous heating furnaces, with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type heating furnaces and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative heating furnaces...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, hot {{plasmonic}} holes {{were excited}} in Ag nanoparticles embedded into the DLC matrix. Therefore, negative photovoltaic effect was observed for DLC:Ag/p-Si heterostructures and conventional positive for DLC:Ag/n-Si ones. Some decrease of the DLC:Ag/Si heterostructures photovoltage and photocurrent with DLC:Ag film thickness {{was found in}} 10 – 150  nm range. It means that photocarriers excited in the Ag nanoparticles, which are located {{too far from the}} DLC:Ag/Si interface, are unable to reach silicon due to the recombination. The dependence of the TAS spectra of DLC:Ag films and photovoltaic properties of DLC:Ag/Si heterostructures on the excitation wavelength can be explained by trapping of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in DLC matrix. This process prevailed over plasmonic photogeneration of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers at lower excitation wavelengths, while energy of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier’s photoexcited by longer wavelength photons was lower than the energy of the trap states. Therefore, these lower energy carriers avoided trapping by DLC defects.|$|R

The spectral feature associated with <b>hot</b> <b>charges</b> does not fully decay on this timescale, but also shows a long-lived (sub-ns) component. As water molecules may interfere with the hydrogen bonding between the CH 3 NH 3 + cations and the inorganic cage, this effect is possibly caused by immobilisation of cation motion, suggesting a key role of CH 3 NH 3 + dipole reorientation in charge thermalisation.

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{progress}} of steel manufacturing technology, such as thin slab casting and <b>hot</b> <b>charging</b> {{has given rise}} to necessity of refinement of austenite grain size in as-cast steels. One of the benefits of such grain refinement could be the alleviation of hot cracking during steel production. In this work, improvement of hot ductility in the peritectic steel by means of deformation after solidification is studied. Tensile specimens were melted and solidified in situ and the hot ductility was examined at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100 °C, under two conditions: with and without a pre-deformation applied between 1400 - 1300 °C in during cooling. It was noticed that such pre-deformation improves the hot ductility significantly. This improvement could be attributed to austenite dynamic recrystallization and grain refinement taking place during the pre-deformation...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} factors having a {{significant}} effect on fuel and energy saving in the production of rolled ferrous metals is matching the operation of the continuous casting machines (CCM) with that of the reheating furnaces so called “continuous technologies ” in the form of “direct rolling ” or “hot charging”. In order to investigate the heat exchange processes, the opportunities for enhancing the energy efficiency and determining the optimal parameters of the flat product production process in ferrous metallurgy, some mathematical models of metal solidification and cooling in a continuous steel casting machine were determined as well as a mathematical model of metal heating in the reheating furnaces. For efficient implementation of such technologies one common algorithm was built {{on the basis of the}} individual mathematical models, representing the continuous casting – rolling mill complex control technology, dynamically matching the operation of the individual units to the actual production conditions in on-line mode.

30|$|As it is {{well known}} to us that the solar {{spectrum}} and the bandgap energy of silicon semiconductor do not match each other, thus photons with energy lower than the bandgap could not be absorbed, while for photons with energy larger than the bandgap, the excess energy is lost by thermalization of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers [4]. Take these sources of energy loss into account for the solar spectrum; the maximum energy efficiency is 30 % only for a crystalline Si solar cell with a bandgap of 1.12 eV [3]. Considering this, if the conversion of one UV or visible photon into two NIR photons with energies about 1.12 eV is realized through QC in a silicon solar cell, the energy loss related to thermalization of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers can be reduced, and the solar cell efficiency will be enhanced greatly to satisfy the application requirement [5].|$|R

Direct detection of such reaction-induced hot electrons and holes is feasible using solid state barrier devices like Schottky diodes with ultrathin metal films. While exposing the diodes to reactive gases, a chemicurrent is {{observed in the}} diodes. The concept of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier detection by chemicurrent measurements and the dependence of the current strength on device properties are discussed in detail.

The current detection sensitivity is improved {{by a factor of}} 10 if the metal films are annealed to room temperature after low-temperature deposition. This annealing effect is related to a reduced scattering of hot electrons in the metal. Chemicurrents are attenuated exponentially with increasing metal film thickness. Attenuation lengths between 6 and 11 nm are observed. They are much smaller than attenuation lengths for photo- and internal photoemission currents. The results demonstrate that chemicurrents are due to <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier excitation and transport and are not attributed to surface chemiluminescence and photon reabsorption in the device...|$|R

30|$|The tendencies {{observed}} {{in this research}} {{can be explained by}} taking into account possible influence of the traps. The results reported in [49] should be mentioned as well. Negative photoconductivity was also observed for InAs nanowires [49]. Origin of the negative photoconductivity was attributed to the depletion of conduction channels by light-assisted hot-electron trapping [49]. Photoconductivity lowering was excitation wavelength dependent. Photocurrent decreased more when excitation wavelength was shorter (higher photon energy) [49]. In our case, we can suppose that at high excitation energies trapping of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in DLC matrix or at the Ag nanoparticle/DLC interface takes place. Thus, photoexcitation of the plasmonic charge carriers competes with the trapping process. It results in suppression of the bleaching in DLC:Ag transient spectra excited by higher energy photons as well as decreased photocurrent and photovoltage. Energy of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers excited by longer wavelength photons is below trap-related states. In such a case, photoexcited plasmonic charge carriers avoid trapping. It results in the increased sample’s photocurrent and photovoltage at higher excitation wavelengths. This fact correlates with the TAS measurements when in TAS spectra of DLC:Ag films excited at higher wavelengths of 627 and 736  nm strong negative signal was observed, too.|$|R
40|$|Understanding cooling of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> {{carriers}} in semiconductor {{quantum dots}} (QDs) is of fundamental interest and useful {{to enhance the}} performance of QDs in photovoltaics. We study electron and hole cooling dynamics in PbSe QDs up to high energies where carrier multiplication occurs. We characterize distinct cooling steps of hot electrons and holes and build up a broadband cooling spectrum for both charge carriers. Cooling of electrons is slower than of holes. At energies near the band gap we find cooling times between successive electronic energy levels {{in the order of}} 0. 5 ps. We argue that here the large spacing between successive electronic energy levels requires cooling to occur by energy transfer to vibrational modes of ligand molecules or phonon modes associated with the QD surface. At high excess energy the energy loss rate of electrons is 1 - 5 eV/ps and exceeds 8 eV/ps for holes. Here charge carrier cooling can be understood in terms of emission of LO phonons with a higher density-of-states in the valence band than the conduction band. The complete mapping of the broadband cooling spectrum for both charge carriers in PbSe QDs is a big step toward understanding and controlling the cooling of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in colloidal QDs. </p...|$|R

30|$|Correlation {{between the}} optical {{absorbance}} spectra excited by different wavelength light and respective photovoltaic {{characteristics of the}} samples can be identified. Particularly, TAS spectra excited by 406 – 528  nm light are much more {{similar to the ones}} recorded for pure DLC matrix signal than to LSPR of Ag nanoparticles relaxation dynamics. Only {{in the case of the}} samples excited by 627 and 736  nm, the negative absorption signal, e.g., generation of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers can be seen. Such behavior was found despite that maximum of the plasmonic absorption peak was observed at ~ 500  nm. On the other hand, open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the samples clearly increased with the excitation wavelength. Such tendency was observed despite the decreased lifetime of the photoexcited charge carriers measured by TAS (see τ 1 in Table  1). Thus, according to Table  1, decrease of the photovoltaic parameters with the excitation wavelength should be expected, as higher photoexcited charge carrier lifetime results in the increased short circuit current. Yet, in our case, the reverse tendency is observed. It seems that at lower excitation, wavelength influence of the DLC matrix results in suppression of the surface plasmon resonance-related <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier photogeneration. Alternatively, one can suppose that insertion of Ag nanoclusters into the DLC matrix results in the rearrangement of the density of the states (DOE).

40|$|This thesis utilises {{computational}} simulations {{to investigate}} the relationship between morphological structure of the active layer within organic photovoltaic devices, {{and its impact on}} the device performance. Specifically, the effects of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> transfer states, the mixed molecular phase and fullerene aggregation on organic photovoltaic performance, and polymer crystallinity on carrier mobility, are explored using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. These investigations agree with experimental results and shed new light on the processes of recombination, ultrafast charge separation and the utility of the amorphous phase within the context of tie-chains. A more accurate charge separation kinetic model is proposed in order to correctly describe the biexponential carrier recombination determined from Monte Carlo investigations. The model incorporates a `quasi-free' state where charges are still Coulombically bound but sufficiently separated to prevent recombination. This is conceptually similar to the cooled remains of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> transfer states, the effects of which are investigated on device operation and shown to provide a benefit that is strongly dependent on the aggregation of the fullerene phase, the limitation of the molecularly mixed phase and the relative charge carrier mobilities. Crystallisation within the polymer medium is then comprehensively explored using a combination of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, along with quantum chemical calculations to help elucidate the observed annealing temperature and molecular weight dependencies of the carrier mobility for a poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) test system. The annealing temperature trend can be explained by increased crystallite size and order, but the molecular weight dependence is not satisfactorily explained by the crystalline regions. Instead, mobility is shown to be limited by the availability of tie-chains in the amorphous phase of the morphology, linking together crystals and providing regions of high mobility through the amorphous material...|$|R

The pattern consists of two concentric rings around the laser excitation spot.

We find that charge-carrier temperature initially decreases rapidly with time in accordance with efficient heat transfer to lattice vibrations. However, cooling rates are subsequently slowed and are significantly lower for nanowires containing a higher density of stacking faults. We conclude that the transfer of charges across the type II interface is followed by release of additional energy to the lattice, which raises the phonon bath temperature above equilibrium and impedes the carrier cooling occurring through interaction with such phonons. These results demonstrate that type II heterointerfaces in semiconductor nanowires can sustain a hot charge-carrier distribution over an extended time period.
