40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} the toxicological and environmental hazards of bisphenol A (BPA) {{and each of}} the 20 alternative chemicals that were identified as potential functional substitutes for BPA. In general, the hazard profiles include the assessment of unchanged starting materials, byproducts, and impurities. Evaluations of chemical formulations may also require the consideration of associated substances (e. g. starting materials, byproducts, and impurities) if their presence is specifically required to allow that alternative to fully function in the assigned role. In general, associated substances were assumed to remain unchanged in this assessment, but may need to be considered in the selection of an alternative. This report is a hazard assessment, not a full risk assessment. Hazard assessment as a risk management tool is discussed in more detail in Section 1. 3. Toxicological and environmental endpoints included in the hazard profiles are discussed in Section 4. 1 along with the criteria used to evaluate each <b>hazard</b> <b>endpoint.</b> Data sources and the review methodology are described in Section 4. 2. The report then offers {{a detailed description of the}} utility of physical/chemical properties in understanding hazard in Section 4. 3. Next, the process of evaluating human health and environmental endpoints are described in Sections 4. ...|$|E

40|$|Hazard {{assessments}} of chemicals {{have been limited}} by the availability of test data and {{the time needed to}} evaluate the test data. While available data may be inadequate for the majority of industrial chemicals, the body of existing knowledge for most hazards is large enough to permit reliable estimates to be made for untested chemicals without additional animal testing. We provide a summary of the growing use by regulatory agencies of the chemical categories approach, which groups chemicals based on their similar toxicological behaviour and fills in the data gaps in animal test data such as genotoxicity and aquatic toxicity. Although the categories approach may be distinguished from the use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for specific <b>hazard</b> <b>endpoints,</b> robust chemical categories are founded on quantifying the chemical structure with parameters that control chemical behaviour in conventional hazard assessment.

40|$|We {{examined}} the {{spatial and temporal}} (hourly) variation of aqueous concentrations of mercury in a gold miner's river to determine factors that control transport, retention, and export of mercury. The mercury flux was estimated to account for episodic inputs of mercury through mining tailings, variations in flow rate, and the partitioning of mercury between dissolved and particulate phases. Water samples were collected upstream and downstream of two gold mining sites in the Artiguas river, Nicaragua. The samples were analyzed for dissolved and suspended mercury, total solids, dissolved organic carbon, and total iron in water. Water velocity was also measured at the sampling sites. We found that mercury was mainly transported in a suspended phase, with a temporal pattern of diurnal peaks corresponding to the amalgamation schedules at the mining plants. The concentrations decreased with distance from the mining sites, suggesting dilution by tributaries or sedimentation of particle-bound mercury. The lowest total mercury concentrations in the water were less than 0. 1 mu g l(- 1) and the highest concentration was 5. 0 mu g l(- 1). The mercury concentrations are below the present WHO guidelines of 6 mu g l(- 1) but are considered {{to lead to a}} higher risk to aquatic bacteria and fish in the stream than to humans. The aqueous concentrations exceed the <b>hazard</b> <b>endpoints</b> for both groups by a probability of about 1 %. Particulate mercury accounted for the largest variation of mercury fluxes, whereas dissolved mercury made up most of the long-range transport along the stream. The estimated total mass of mercury retained due to sedimentation of suspended solids was 2. 7 kg per year, and the total mass exported downstream from the mining area was 1. 6 kg per year.

40|$|AbstractThis {{publication}} {{introduces a}} series of eight other publications describing the non-clinical assessment and initial clinical study of a candidate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) – the Tobacco Heating System 2. 2 (THS 2. 2). This paper presents background information on tobacco harm reduction, to complement the approaches aimed at increasing smoking cessation and reducing smoking initiation to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by cigarette smoking. THS 2. 2 heats tobacco without combustion, and the resulting formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) is greatly reduced compared with cigarette smoke. Assessment of the THS 2. 2 aerosol in vitro and in vivo reveals reduced toxicity and no new <b>hazards.</b> Additional mechanistic <b>endpoints,</b> measured as part of in vivo studies, confirmed reduced impact on smoking-related disease networks. The clinical study confirmed the reduced exposure to HPHCs in smokers switching to THS 2. 2, and the associated transcriptomic study confirmed the utility of a gene expression signature, consisting of only 11 genes tested in the blood transcriptome of subjects enrolled in the clinical study, as a complementary measure of exposure response. The potential of THS 2. 2 as an MRTP is demonstrated by the assessment and additional publications cited in this series...|$|R

Although numerous definitions of EC exist, {{it is not}} clear which, if any, best identify this rare phenotype. Methods: We assessed a number of EC definitions used in the literature using CASCADE data of 25, 692 HIV seroconverters. We estimated proportions maintaining EC of total ART-naı̈ve follow-up time, and disease progression, comparing to non-EC. We also examined HIV-RNA and CD 4 values and CD 4 slope during EC and beyond (while ART naı̈ve). Results: Most definitions classify, 1 % as ECs with median HIV-RNA 43 – 903 copies/ml and median CD 4. 500 cells/mm 3. Beyond EC status, median HIV-RNA levels remained low, although often detectable, and CD 4 values high but with strong evidence of decline for all definitions. Median % ART-naı̈ve time as EC was $ 92 % although overlap between definitions was low. EC definitions with consecutive HIV-RNA measurements, 75 copies/ml with follow-up $ six months, or with 90 % of measurements, 400 copies/ml over $ 10 year follow-up preformed best overall.

40|$|Aims: Leucocyte {{telomere}} {{length is}} considered a marker of biological ageing and has been suggested to be shorter in patients with CAD and heart failure compared with healthy controls. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether telomere length is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart failure and whether this association is superior to chronological age as defined by date of birth. Methods and results: We measured leucocyte telomere length in 3275 patients with chronic ischaemic systolic heart failure participating in the COntrolled ROsuvastatin multiNAtional Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) study. The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke, which occurred in 575 patients during follow-up. We observed a significant association of leucocyte telomere lengths with the primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 – 1. 20; P[*]=[*] 0. 03). However, this observation was not superior to age as defined by date of birth. The neutral effect of rosuvastatin treatment on clinical outcomes was not modified by baseline telomere length. Conclusion: Biological age as defined by leucocyte telomere length was associated with clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart failure, but this association did not add prognostic information above age as defined by date of birth...|$|R

However, a separate comparison of clinical outcome among patients treated for multiple lesions with these stents is lacking. We performed this comparison within the SORT OUT III trial data set. Methods Among 2332 patients randomized in SORT OUT III, 695 were treated for multiple lesions with zotarolimus-eluting (n = 350) or sirolimus-eluting (n = 345) stents and followed for 18 months. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE); composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization (TVR); was the primary endpoint. Results Zotarolimus-eluting compared to sirolimus-eluting stent treatment was associated with increased MACE rate (13. 2 % vs. 2. 6 %; hazard ratio 5. 29 with 95 % confidence interval: 2. 59 - 10. 8). All secondary endpoints; all cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, TVR, target lesion revascularization, in-stent restenosis, and definite stent thrombosis; were observed more frequently among zotarolimus-eluting stent treated patients.

This trial compares clinical outcomes of early surgery and conventional treatment {{in patients with}} IE. Methods: Results: Thirty-seven patients {{were assigned to the}} early-surgery group (< 48 hours), whereas 39 were assigned to conventional therapy. Of the 39 randomly assigned to conventional therapy, 27 patients (77 %) underwent surgery during the initial hospitalization and three during follow-up. One patient (3 %) in the early-surgery group and nine (23 %) in the conventional-treatment group reached the primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio (HR) 0. 10, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 to 0. 82; P = 0. 03). There {{was no significant difference in}} all-cause mortality at 6 months in the early-surgery and conventional-treatment groups (3 % and 5 %, respectively; HR 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 05 to 5. 66; P = 0. 59). The rates of the composite endpoint of death from any cause, embolic events, or recurrence of IE at 6 months were 3 % in the early-surgery group and 28 % in the conventional-treatment group (HR 0. 08, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 65; P = 0. 02).

40|$|AbstractTest {{batteries}} {{to screen}} chemicals for mutagenic <b>hazard</b> include several <b>endpoints</b> regarded as effective for detecting genotoxic carcinogens. Traditional in vivo methods primarily examine clastogenic endpoints in haematopoietic tissues. Although {{this approach is}} effective for identifying systemically distributed clastogens, some mutagens may not induce clastogenic effects; moreover, genotoxic effects may be restricted {{to the site of}} contact and/or related tissues. An OECD test guideline for transgenic rodent (TGR) gene mutation assays was released in 2011, and the TGR assays permit assessment of mutagenicity in any tissue. This study assessed the responses of two genotoxicity endpoints following sub-chronic oral exposures of male Muta™Mouse to 9 carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Clastogenicity was assessed via induction of micronuclei in peripheral blood, and mutagenicity via induction of lacZ transgene mutations in bone marrow, glandular stomach, small intestine, liver, and lung. Additionally, the presence of bulky PAH-DNA adducts was examined. Five of the 9 PAHs elicited positive results across all endpoints in at least one tissue, and no PAHs were negative or equivocal across all endpoints. All PAHs were positive for lacZ mutations in at least one tissue (sensitivity= 100 %), and for 8 PAHs, one or more initial sites of chemical contact (i. e., glandular stomach, liver, small intestine) yielded a greater response than bone marrow. Five PAHs were positive in the micronucleus assay (sensitivity= 56 %). Furthermore, all PAHs produced DNA adducts in at least one tissue.

Also, SNPs to explain variation in 25 (OH) D have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Detection of direct associations between SNPs that significantly affect 25 (OH) D and CVD risk would indicate a causal role of vitamin D, as reverse causation could be excluded and confounding could be better controlled. Thus, a combined analysis of candidate SNPs in relation to circulating 25 (OH) D and CVD risk was carried out. A case-cohort study within the EPIC-Germany study was conducted comprising a randomly drawn subcohort of 2, 132 subjects (57. 9 % women, mean age: 50. 6 years) and incident cases of myocardial infarction (n= 559) and stroke (n= 471) that occurred during a mean follow-up duration of 7. 6 years. 25 (OH) D concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS in baseline plasma samples. Additionally, eight candidate SNPs were assayed. Associations between 25 (OH) D, SNPs and the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke were assessed by multivariable regression analyses. Mean 25 (OH) D level was 47. 2 nmol/L in the subcohort. Four SNPs were associated with 25 (OH) D (p< 0. 05).

The {{aim of this}} study was to retrospectively assess the long-term clinical outcomes in young patients who underwent PCI. Methods and resultsBetween 1985 and 2011, 7649 consecutive patients underwent PCI, and data from 69 young adults (age ≤ 40 years) and 4255 old adults (age ≧ 65 years) were analyzed. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of a composite endpoint that included all-cause death and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the follow-up period. The mean age of the 69 young patients was 36. 1 ± 4. 9 years, and 96 % of them were men. Approximately 30 % were current smokers, and their body mass index (BMI) was 26. 7 ± 5. 0 kg/m 2. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 33 % and 48 %, respectively. All patients had ≥ 1 conventional cardiovascular risk factor.

MethodsA total of 305 T 2 DM patients without known CVD referred to a diabetes clinic were included consecutively (age 58. 6  ± 11. 3 years, diabetes duration 2. 0 [interquartile range: 0 to 6. 0] years). Each patient underwent a comprehensive echocardiogram and a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) at inclusion. Patients were divided according to left atrial volume index (LAVi)  ≥ 32 ml/m 2. Patients were followed for median of 5. 6 (interquartile range: 5. 1 to 6. 1) years for the occurrence of major cardiac events and death. ResultsLAVi ≥ 32 ml/m 2 was found in 105 patients (34 %). During follow-up, 60 patients (20 %) experienced the composite endpoint, of whom 28 (9 %) died. Patients with LAVi ≥ 32 ml/m 2 had a significantly higher cardiac event rate and death rate (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 002, respectively). Univariate predictors of the composite endpoint were age, hypertension, left ventricular diastolic function, E/e′septum-ratio and LAVi ≥ 32 ml/m 2; however, myocardial ischemia on MPS was not a predictor.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the association between newly revealed abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) and clinical outcomes in patients with significant coronary artery stenosis. BackgroundLittle {{is known about the}} prevalence and clinical implications of ABI in patients with no claudication or previous history of peripheral artery disease who undergo diagnostic coronary angiography. MethodsBetween January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009, ABI was evaluated in 2, 543 consecutive patients with no clinical history of claudication or peripheral artery disease who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. Abnormal ABI was defined as ≤ 0. 9 or ≥ 1. 4. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke over 3 years. ResultsOf the 2, 543 patients, 390 (15. 3 %) had abnormal ABI. Of the 2, 424 patients with at least 1  significant stenosis (≥ 50 %) in a major epicardial coronary artery, 385 (15. 9 %) had abnormal ABI, including 348 (14. 4 %) with ABI ≤ 0. 9 and 37 (1. 5 %) with ABI ≥ 1. 4. During a median follow-up of 986  days, the 3 -year major adverse event rate was significantly higher in patients with abnormal than normal ABI (15. 7 % vs. 3. 3 %, p < 0. 001). After multivariate analysis, abnormal ABI was identified as a predictor of primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio [HR]: 1. 87; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 23 to 2. 84; p =  0. 004). After adjustment by propensity-score matching, abnormal ABI could predict adverse clinical events in patients with established coronary artery disease (HR: 2. 40; 95 % CI: 1. 41 to 4. 10; p =  0. 001). ConclusionsThe prevalence of newly revealed abnormal, asymptomatic ABI among patients who have significant CAD on coronary angiography was 15. 9 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{and other}} {{investigators}} previously reported that isolated nocturnal hypertension on ambulatory measurement (INH) clustered with cardiovascular {{risk factors and}} was associated with intermediate target organ damage. We investigated whether INH might also predict hard cardiovascular endpoints. METHODS AND RESULTS: We monitored blood pressure (BP) throughout the day and followed health outcomes in 8711 individuals randomly recruited from 10 populations (mean age 54. 8 years, 47. 0 % women). Of these, 577 untreated individuals had INH (daytime BP /= 120 / 70 mmHg) and 994 untreated individuals had isolated daytime hypertension on ambulatory measurement (IDH; daytime BP >/= 135 / 85 mmHg and night-time BP < 120 / 70 mmHg). During follow-up (median 10. 7 years), 1284 deaths (501 cardiovascular) occurred and 1109 participants experienced a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, compared with normotension (n = 3837), INH {{was associated with a}} higher risk of total mortality (hazard ratio 1. 29, P = 0. 045) and all cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1. 38, P = 0. 037). IDH was associated with increases in all cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1. 46, P = 0. 0019) and cardiac <b>endpoints</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio 1. 53, P = 0. 0061). Of 577 patients with INH, 457 were normotensive (< 140 / 90 mmHg) on office BP measurement. Hazard ratios associated with INH with additional adjustment for office BP were 1. 31 (P = 0. 039) and 1. 38 (P = 0. 044) for total mortality and all cardiovascular events, respectively. After exclusion of patients with office hypertension, these hazard ratios were 1. 17 (P = 0. 31) and 1. 48 (P = 0. 034). CONCLUSION: INH predicts cardiovascular outcome in patients who are normotensive on office or on ambulatory daytime BP measurement. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An exaggerated morning blood {{pressure}} surge (MBPS) {{may be associated}} with stroke and other cardiovascular events, but the threshold at which an MBPS becomes pathological is unclear. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature and establish the most appropriate definition of pathological MBPS. METHODS: A MEDLINE search strategy was adapted for a range of literature databases to identify all prospective studies relating an exaggerated MBPS to cardiovascular <b>endpoints.</b> <b>Hazard</b> ratios (HRs) were extracted and synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 2, 964 unique articles, of which 17 were eligible for the study. Seven different definitions of MBPS were identified; the most common was a prewaking surge (mean {{blood pressure}} for 2 hours after wake-up minus mean blood pressure for 2 hours before wake-up; n = 6 studies). Summary meta-analysis gave no clear evidence that prewaking MBPS (defined by a predetermined threshold: > 25 - 55 mm Hg) was associated with all cardiovascular events (n = 2 studies; HR = 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 39 - 2. 28) or stroke (n = 2 studies; HR = 1. 26, 95 % CI = 0. 92 - 1. 71). However, using a continuous scale, which has more power to detect an association, there was evidence that a 10 mm Hg increase in MBPS was related to an increased risk of stroke (n = 3 studies; HR = 1. 11, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 20). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that when measured and analyzed as a continuous variable, increasing levels of MBPS {{may be associated with}} increased risk of stroke.

Methods: A multicenter retrospective pilot study was performed to evaluate 928 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome, receiving aspirin and one P 2 Y 12 antagonist (324 ticagrelor or 604 clopidogrel). Using propensity score matching, 448 patients were selected and divided into two equal groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to study patient survival and event-free status using the log-rank test. Independent covariates were identified using univariate in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results: In the overall cohort, significant differences were observed for certain variables between the two groups. During the mean 164. 3 (± 116. 4) -day follow-up in the overall cohort, ticagrelor treatment had no significant effect on the primary efficacy endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death); however, in the matched cohort, ticagrelor showed a lower incidence of primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio: 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 30 – 1. 04; p =  0. 07) and stroke (hazard ratio: 0. 15; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02 – 1. 24; p =  0. 08) with marginal statistical significance, and a similar bleeding rate. The protective effect of ticagrelor treatment was consistent for all subgroups. More patients treated with ticagrelor experienced dyspnea (21. 0 % vs. 11. 6 %, p =  0. 007), and P 2 Y 12 antagonist treatment was consequently discontinued. Conclusion: Ticagrelor treatment could provide a marginally favorable effect at the expense of an increased risk of dyspnea in real-life situations.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{is unclear}} whether {{achieving}} multiple risk factor (RF) goals through protocol-guided intensive medical therapy is feasible or improves outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus. ObjectivesThis study sought to quantify the relationship between achieved RF goals in the BARI 2 D (Bypass Angioplasty Investigation Revascularization 2 Diabetes) trial and cardiovascular events/survival. MethodsWe performed a nonrandomized analysis of survival/cardiovascular events and control of 6 RFs (no smoking, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 130 mg/dl, triglycerides < 150 mg/dl, blood pressure [systolic < 130 mm Hg; diastolic < 80 mm Hg], glycosylated hemoglobin < 7 %) in BARI 2 D. Cox models with time-varying number of RFs in control were adjusted for baseline number of RFs in control, clinical characteristics, and trial randomization assignments. ResultsIn 2, 265 patients (mean age 62 years, 29 % women) followed up for 5 years, the mean ± SD number of RFs in control improved from 3. 5 ± 1. 4 at baseline to 4. 2 ± 1. 3 at 5 years (p < 0. 0001). The number of RFs in control during the trial was strongly related to death (global p = 0. 0010) and the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (global p = 0. 0035) in fully adjusted models. Participants with 0 to 2 RFs in control during follow-up had a 2 -fold higher risk of death (hazard ratio: 2. 0; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 3 to 3. 3; p = 0. 0031) and a 1. 7 -fold higher risk of the composite <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio: 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 2 to 2. 5; p = 0. 0043), compared with those with 6 RFs in control.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that higher serum cholesterol may be associated with lower occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study is to test the hypothesis that higher serum cholesterol correlates with slower PD progression. Baseline non-fasting serum total cholesterol was measured in 774 of the 800 subjects with early PD enrolled between 1987 and 1988 in the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) trial. Participants were followed for up to two years, with clinical disability requiring levodopa therapy as the primary <b>endpoint.</b> <b>Hazard</b> ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were determined for increasing serum cholesterol concentration (in quintiles) for clinical disability requiring levodopa therapy, after adjusting for confounders. At baseline, only nine subjects reported use of cholesterol-lowering agents (two with statins). The overall mean cholesterol level was 216 mg/dL (range 100 - 355). The HR of progressing to the primary endpoint decreased with increasing serum cholesterol concentrations. Compared to the lowest quintile, the HRs (95 %CI), for each higher quintile (in ascending order) are 0. 83 (0. 59 - 1. 16); 0. 86 (0. 61 - 1. 20); 0. 84 (0. 60 - 1. 18); and 0. 75 (0. 52 - 1. 09).

This trend was found in males (HR per SD =  0. 88 [(0. 77 - 1. 00), p for trend =  0. 05], but not in females [HR =  1. 03 (0. 81 - 1. 32) ]. This secondary analysis of the DATATOP trial provides preliminary evidence that higher total serum cholesterol concentrations may be associated with a modest slower clinical progression of PD, and this preliminary finding needs confirmation from larger prospective studies...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} association between progressive intraventricular conduction disturbance and cardiovascular prognosis. From among a database containing 359, 737 12 -lead ECG recordings, patients whose QRS duration progressively increased from < 120 msec to ≥ 120 msec were selected using software. The prognosis of patients was searched by medical record. The primary endpoint was defined as heart failure hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was heart failure hospitalization, device implantation, or cardiovascular death. A total of 143 patients (100 males; age, 58. 9 ± 11. 1 years) were enrolled in this study. QRS duration increased by 46. 4 ± 13. 8 msec, manifesting right bundle branch block (RBBB) in 99 (69. 2 %) patients and non-RBBB (i. e., left bundle branch block, RBBB with left anterior hemiblock, or nonspecific intraventricular conduction disturbance) in 44 (30. 8 %). During the follow-up (mean, 16. 6 ± 5. 3 years), 44 (30. 3 %), 15 (10. 3 %), and 6 (4. 1 %) patients resulted in heart failure hospitalization, device implantation, and cardiovascular death, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models revealed that 1) the temporal increase in QRS duration was associated with the primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio [HR] 1. 98; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 05 - 3. 80; p = 0. 04) and the secondary endpoint (HR 2. 79; 95 % CI 1. 55 - 5. 00; p = 0. 0001) and 2) the development of non-RBBB was associated with the primary endpoint (HR 3. 02; 95 % CI 1. 59 - 5. 73; p = 0. 0001) and the secondary endpoint (HR 2. 82; 95 % CI 1. 57 - 5. 09; p = 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{metabolic}} and cardiovascular effects of metformin {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes (DM 2) who use insulin. DESIGN: Prospective randomised placebo-controlled clinical study. METHODS: The effects of metformin in 390 DM 2 patients during a follow-up period of 4. 3 years were studied. Either metformin or placebo {{was added to the}} insulin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose (850 mg 1 - 3 times daily). The primary endpoint was an aggregate score of microvascular and macrovascular events plus acute mortality. The secondary endpoints were separate aggregate scores of macrovascular events plus acute mortality {{on the one hand and}} microvascular events on the other. In addition, effects on the HbA 1 c value, insulin requirement, lipid values, blood pressure, body weight, and BMI were analysed. The trial is registered with Clinical Trials Identifier NCT 00375388. RESULTS: Metformin treatment prevented weight gain (- 3. 07 kg compared to placebo; 95 % CI: - 3. 85 to - 2. 28; p < 0. 001), improved glycaemic control (HbA 1 c: - 0. 4 %; 95 % CI: - 0. 55 to - 0. 25; p < 0. 001), and reduced insulin requirements (- 19. 63 IU/day; 95 % CI: - 24. 91 to - 14. 36; p < 0. 001). Metformin was not associated with an improvement in the primary endpoint. It was, however, associated with an improvement in the secondary, macrovascular <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 40 to 0. 94); p = 0. 02), which was partly explained by the effect on body weight. The number of patients that had to be treated to prevent one macrovascular event was 16. 1 (95 % CI: 9. 2 to 66. 6). CONCLUSION: Metformin, added to insulin in patients with DM 2, led to a more favourable body weight, an improved glucose regulation with less insulin and a lower risk of macrovascular events. These findings support the policy of continuing the treatment with metformin in patients with DM 2 who start to use insulin...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe study {{sought to}} assess the primary {{preventive}} effect of neurohumoral therapy in high-risk diabetic patients selected by N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). BackgroundFew clinical trials have successfully demonstrated the prevention of cardiac events in patients with diabetes. One reason for this might be an inaccurate selection of patients. NT-proBNP has not been assessed in this context. MethodsA total of 300 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated NT-proBNP (> 125 pg/ml) but free of cardiac disease were randomized. The “control” group was cared for at 4 diabetes care units; the “intensified” group was additionally treated at a cardiac outpatient clinic for the up-titration of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists and beta-blockers. The primary endpoint was hospitalization/death due to cardiac disease after 2 years. ResultsAt baseline, {{the mean age of}} the patients was 67. 5 ± 9 years, duration of diabetes was 15 ± 12 years, 37 % were male, HbA 1 c was 7 ± 1. 1 %, blood pressure was 151 ± 22 mm Hg, heart rate was 72 ± 11 beats/min, median NT-proBNP was 265. 5 pg/ml (interquartile range: 180. 8 to 401. 8 pg/ml). After 12 months there was a significant difference between the number of patients treated with a RAS antagonist/beta-blocker and the dosage reached between groups (p < 0. 0001). Blood pressure was significantly reduced in both (p < 0. 05); heart rate was only reduced in the intensified group (p = 0. 004). A significant reduction of the primary <b>endpoint</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio: 0. 351; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 127 to 0. 975, p = 0. 044) was visible in the intensified group. The same was true for other endpoints: all-cause hospitalization, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations/death (p < 0. 05 for all). ConclusionsAccelerated up-titration of RAS antagonists and beta-blockers to maximum tolerated dosages is an effective and safe intervention for the primary prevention of cardiac events for diabetic patients pre-selected using NT-proBNP.

An image classification of ADPKD into typical (diffuse cyst distribution) class 1 A to E (by age- and height-adjusted total kidney volume [TKV]) and atypical (asymmetric cyst distribution) class 2 was proposed for prognostic enrichment design, recommending inclusion of only classes 1 C to 1 E in RCTs. Methods: A post hoc exploratory analysis was conducted of the TEMPO 3 : 4 Trial, a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial in adult subjects with ADPKD, an estimated creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min and total kidney volume > 750 ml.
