40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to be a broad survey of both the present and the potential role of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> in education and research. Against a background of the history of business games, we first try to characterize the present development of these <b>games.</b> A few <b>management</b> <b>games</b> are described in some detail, and a number of others are mentioned only briefly. The differences between general and functional business games are discussed. Present uses of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> as a teaching device are surveyed and evaluated. Some hypotheses regarding the relations between the design and administrative characteristics of a business game and its educational properties are also formulated. What might be a major improvement over existing <b>management</b> <b>games,</b> here named the "game case," is then suggested. In the concluding portion of this paper, the potential use of <b>management</b> <b>games</b> as a laboratory for business and social science research is surveyed. Some methodological problems which would arise from research uses of business games are also discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|In most cases, {{the terms}} {{business}} (simulation) <b>game</b> and <b>management</b> (simulation) <b>game</b> {{can be used}} interchangeably {{and there is no}} well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al. determine a business game (or business simulation) as a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation. The descriptions given for a <b>management</b> <b>game,</b> for example, by Forrester and Naylor do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood determines that in a <b>management</b> <b>game</b> profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe define a <b>management</b> <b>game</b> as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.|$|R
25|$|Mourinho {{is highly}} renowned for his {{tactical}} prowess, <b>game</b> <b>management</b> and adaptability to different situations. A usual feature of his teams {{is playing with}} three or more central midfielders, as Mourinho has stressed midfield superiority as crucial in winning games. As a Porto manager, Mourinho employed a diamond 4–4–2 formation, with his midfield – consisting of Costinha or Pedro Mendes as defensive midfielder; Maniche and Dmitri Alenichev as wide central midfielders; and Deco on the tip – acting as a cohesive unit rather than a collection of individuals, providing Porto with midfield superiority while allowing the full-backs to move forward.|$|E

Several of the plains like Chikufwe are home to common reedbuck, buffalo, sable antelope and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, which are often encountered in the dry season. A small population of plains zebra occurs in the park. Roan antelope, defassa waterbuck and Sharpe's grysbok occur but are rare and seldom seen, whereas warthog numbers are increasing and they are commonly sighted.

25|$|In 2005 the Rangers again {{struggled}} to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that the team swept an entire homestand {{for the first time}} in its history. Frank Francisco and Carlos Almanzar, two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined for Tommy John surgery. Kenny Rogers, the team's ace pitcher, received a 20-game suspension from commissioner Bud Selig for attacking a cameraman at Ameriquest Field prior to a <b>game.</b> <b>Management</b> later placed opening day starter Ryan Drese on waivers, where he was claimed by the Washington Nationals. After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1–12 August road trip all but sealed the squad's fate.|$|E

40|$|<b>Management</b> <b>games</b> and {{teaching}} simulations have obtained widespread adoption in business schools and management development programs. While {{a number of}} summary evaluations have demonstrated {{the efficacy of the}} <b>management</b> <b>game</b> as a learning environment, little is known about what behavior players exercise within the game situation. Using the critical incident technique, the author collected 1, 453 behavior citations of effective and ineffective performance by 211 students playing one of two different <b>management</b> <b>games.</b> The reported behaviors fell into seven broad performance groupings covering the students' pregame preparation, their company's personality and operating characteristics, Board meeting atmosphere and interpersonal climate, the team's use of forecasting, analytical, and planning techniques, and their decision making mechanics. It was found that the <b>management</b> <b>games</b> rewarded rational policy and decision making practices and that chance played no consistent part in company success. As a teaching device, the <b>management</b> <b>game</b> appears to provide many of the elements needed for education in business policy and decision making. ...|$|R

25|$|Although the Rams {{were one}} of the most {{productive}} teams in NFL history at the time, head coach Mike Martz was criticized by many as careless with <b>game</b> <b>management.</b> He often feuded with several players as well as team president and general manager, Jay Zygmunt. However, most of his players respected him and went on record saying that they enjoyed him as a coach. In 2005, Martz was ill, and was hospitalized for several games, allowing assistant head coach Joe Vitt to coach the remainder of the season, although Martz was cleared later in the season, team president John Shaw would not allow him to come back to coach the team. After the Rams fired Martz, former Minnesota offensive coordinator Scott Linehan took control of an 8–8 team in 2006. In 2007, Linehan led the Rams to 3–13.|$|E

500|$|Different combat {{options are}} {{available}} to characters based on class. For example, fighters can wield melee or ranged weapons; magic-users can cast spells; thieves {{have the option to}} [...] "back-stab" [...] an opponent by strategically positioning themselves.

Fighters also gain the ability to [...] "sweep" [...] enemies, effectively attacking each nearby low-level creature in the same turn. Magic-users and clerics are allowed to memorize and cast a set number of spells each day. Once cast, a spell must be memorized again before reuse. The process requires hours of inactivity for all characters, during which they rest in a camp; this also restores lost hit points to damaged characters. This chore of memorizing spells each night significantly added to the amount of <b>game</b> <b>management</b> required by the player.|$|E
