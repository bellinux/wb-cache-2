He takes the job, but the real Skinner finds himself isolated by the townspeople who realize they prefer Armin over him.

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

25|$|Westcountry Television, another {{independent}} company, replaced Television South West at 00:00 GMT on 1 January 1993. The first programme {{aired on}} the channel was a video welcoming viewers to Westcountry and promising {{higher levels of}} regional commitment. Later, Westcountry was purchased by Carlton Television, {{and it is now}} simply part of the ITV Network. However, since that original commitment to regional programming in 1993 (and approximately 16 hours of regional programmes per week), in 2007 this had been reduced to less than seven hours per week. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> mention of Westcountry on the ITV network in Cornwall, except for a vague verbal mention before a local programme is shown. Despite this, Westcountry Television has remained committed to Cornwall since launch, and have two small news studios in the county at Truro and Penzance. There is also a five-minute opt-out, broadcast from Redruth transmitting station of news stories specific {{to the west of the}} ITV Westcountry region (there are three others, based in Barnstaple, Plymouth and Exeter.) It does mean though that those viewers in the east of the county receive news aimed at Plymouth City and the South Hams areas, as the Caradon Hill transmitting station covers Plymouth and Mid and South Devon as well as east Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|By 8 May 1946, {{the first}} anniversary of VE Day, he was presumed officially dead for the purpose of probate, though the {{substantive}} assumption of death was delayed until October 1946. However, although he had died intestate Skepper had left a ‘soldier’s will’ and his estate was administered on 18 January 1948, with the administration document simply saying that he had died ‘on war service’. His whole estate was valued at £38,035 18s 2d (a huge sum for that time) and his mother then informed the London School of Economics that he had said that in the event of his death, at least part of this should be used for the furtherance of sociology at the School. A bequest of £20,000 (currently worth approximately £500,000-£700,000) was made via a deed of trust, for ‘Sociological Research at the School’ by the establishment of The Charles Skepper House for Sociological Research with a Research Fellowship and Studentships.

25|$|In economics, the Laffer {{curve is}} a {{theoretical}} {{representation of the}} relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation. It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by thought experiment. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>any</b> incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the extreme value theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.|$|E
