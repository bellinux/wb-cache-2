5000|$|In the Junk Series Coventry {{takes the}} {{flattened}} and crumpled remnants of McDonalds packaging, {{as it would}} be found on the pavements, and crops them {{in such a way as}} to transform them into iconic constructivist compositions, rendered in the brands ubiquitous livery. In an interview with Whitechapel Gallery director Iwona Blazwick in 2008, Coventry said: [...] "I wanted to present them Junk Series as Suprematist-looking objects, using the colours red, yellow and blue. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> that capitalism can consume anything, that McDonalds can consume suprematism. No matter what you do to react against it, it just welcomes it with open arms and says lets make some money from it.".|$|E
5000|$|Plan (1993). Oil {{painting}} on a [...] canvas. This painting depicts a nude female figure with contour lines marked on her body, {{much like that}} of a topographical map. Saville said of this work: [...] "The lines on her body are the marks they make before you have liposuction done to you. They draw these things that look like targets. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> of mapping of the body, not necessarily areas to be cut away, but like geographical contours on a map. I didn't draw on to the body. I wanted the idea of cutting into the paint. Like you would cut into the body. It evokes the idea of surgery. It has lots of connotations." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> really <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>I</b> {{believe that}} this could be used in a lesson or unit about the Coastlines of Michigan. Since Michigan has so many feet of coastlines you could really make this {{effective}} by relating this to the Midwest/Great Lakes region. You could bring up the fact that Michigan has a problem with coastline erosion. That could be included in a lesson about Michigan's coastline or any state's coastline that touched the Great Lakes. ...|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} song that I wrote for the album, <b>this</b> was <b>like</b> two years ago, which is crazy to say that. I just knew it was {{something}} that I wanted to say. I just felt compelled, and I didn’t even really still know about the whole concept of the album yet, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> in my mind, but this is just something I really needed to say.|$|R

30|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> {{since it}} is very {{convenient}} and enables better understanding because you get to watch it your own pace.|$|E
40|$|I {{see myself}} as a maker. Most of what I do is make paintings, but to define myself as a painter puts other {{projects}} at a critical disadvantage, labeling them as “side projects. ” Robert Morris once said that although visually his work may vary a great deal, he felt the ideas flowed throughout the work. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea.</b> The role of the studio and the idea of play as both diligent investigation and a way of playing a game with the viewer is part of what I will discuss. In addition, I use game spaces as a surrogate to look at interpersonal interactions and as setting for a game within a game dynamic to be discussed...|$|E
