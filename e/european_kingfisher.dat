5000|$|Gerald was a keen and observant {{student of}} natural history, but {{the value of}} his {{observations}} is lessened by credulity and inability to distinguish fact from legend. He gives a vivid and accurate description of the last colony of the European beaver in Wales on the River Teifi, but spoils it by repeating the legend that beavers castrate themselves to avoid danger. Likewise he gives a good description of an osprey fishing, but adds the mythical detail that the bird has one webbed foot. His description of Irish wildlife {{has been the subject of}} much adverse comment for its inaccuracies and lapses into fiction but nonetheless, despite its faults, it gives an important glimpse of Irish fauna in the 1180s. [...] Certainly the book has valuable details about Irish birds: while the <b>European</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is now common in Ireland, Gerald states clearly that it was not found there in his time: on the other hand the European dipper, which he had evidently not seen before, was very common in Ireland. He also observed the great numbers of birds of prey in Ireland, including the golden eagle and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which he said were more numerous in Ireland than in England.|$|E
40|$|This study reviews all {{available}} {{data for the}} <b>European</b> <b>kingfisher</b> in Europe (Euring database). The analysis of the mortality causes based on 966 juveniles and 753 adults reveals that {{a large proportion of}} the carcasses (43 %) are just reported as “found dead”. Other major causes of mortality listed in the database include percussions against a window (22 %), collisions with engines (10 %), other types of collisions (5 %) or predation by domestic cats (5 %). For both adults and juveniles, predation by cats is the most common death cause in Great Britain while in North Western Europe, mortality is mostly due to the percussion against windows. Juvenile mortality is highest at the end of the summer and in autumn, while adults decease mostly in the spring. The <b>European</b> <b>kingfisher</b> lifespan is short. Its demographic structure, studied in 4028 juveniles and 1131 adults, shows that mortality is very important during the first winter, as 70 % of the juveniles do not reach the next spring. The mortality rate is similar in subsequent reproductive seasons. The different pyramids of age are not identical (between adults and juveniles, between regions, between sexes) but the trend is similar: a reproductive individual has a probability of one third to reproduce the next year. Less than 10 % of the European kingfishers survive over four years. Peer reviewe...|$|E
50|$|The dry grasslands, which {{cover the}} {{limestone}} and sandstone soils, are also rich in fauna and flora. They house the snake Vipera aspis, the large blue butterfly, the blue-winged grasshopper and the bee orchid. The heathland {{in the north}} of Mayenne is populated by dwarf gorse and cross-leaved heath {{and there are plenty of}} spiders, nightjars and warblers. The old quarries are the refuge of bats, amphibians, the shining cranesbill and greater butterfly orchid. Rivers and ponds are home to eel, northern crested newt, <b>European</b> otter, <b>kingfisher,</b> grass snake, common moorhen and plants such as spearwort, yellow flag, arrowhead and Isopyrum thalictroides, a small poisonous plant.|$|R
