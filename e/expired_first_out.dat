40|$|Abstract — A {{phenomenon}} {{that is very}} common in supermarkets bulk orders of food materials are given which results in extra stocks of food materials than which is needed and finally leads to wastage. Many still make a profit from selling a few items of the product and throwing the left out. The belief is that, not caring about the customer feeling that their supermarket has an endless supply of goods is more valuable than predicting the order in advance, and possibly getting it wrong. Representing the hypermarket, the objective of our forecasting {{is to reduce the}} spoilage of perishable foods in the hypermarket by accurately forecasting sales on a daily basis by using historical data and Holt-Winter model, we have plan to forecast daily demand for 30 days for 'Vegetables ', 'Meat ', 'Fruits ' and 'Milk Products '. This model includes two methods – additive method for finding seasonal variation and multiplicative method for proportional variation. The FEFO(First <b>Expired</b> <b>First</b> <b>Out)</b> principle including the calculation of shelf life is used to get the product consumed by the customer before the expiry date. The major benefit is that it gives consumers the chance to enjoy fresh products and reduce the reatailing cost. It highly focusses on hygiene of customers as well as it gives increased customer satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{natural decay}} of fresh {{products}} is an unavoidable process and generates great loss a long the fresh food supply chain. The FEFO heuristic – <b>First</b> <b>Expire</b> <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> – improves {{the management of}} perishable products during its storage; nevertheless, there are strong technical limitations. This paper proposes the use of automatic conditions monitoring of fresh products in order to overcome current limitations. The proposal is based on simulation scenarios. Information and comunication technologies (ITC) support the implementation of automatic conditions monitoring of perishable products to guide the optimal inventory rotation...|$|R
2500|$|A team must skate {{a minimum}} of three attackers on the ice at all times. If an {{accumulation}} of penalties would otherwise force a team to fall below this minimum, the situation becomes known as [...] "stacked penalties". This means that the new penalty will start when one of the already-penalized players causing the disadvantage is allowed back onto the ice, whether the time expires or the opposing team scores on the Power Play. This also means that the player whose penalty <b>expires</b> <b>first</b> <b>out</b> of the three must wait for a stoppage in play, or the expiration of the second penalty, before leaving the penalty box so that it is appropriately 5 on 3, 5 on 4, and 5 on 5 in succession for each respective situation. Penalties that allow for immediate substitution (certain coincidental penalties and misconduct penalties) do not produce a disadvantage and thus do not count for stacked penalties. Stacked penalties still apply in shorthanded overtimes because two penalties still result in a five-on-three situation regardless of the initial lineup due to the rules allowing an extra attacker as needed.|$|R

A relay node whose internal timer <b>expires</b> <b>first</b> broadcasts {{a signal to}} neighbor relays to stop their transmission to reserve the channel, which is a first-come-first-serve policy. The sink nodes that successfully overhear the network-coded packets decode the packets using theirs own stored data and update their decoding results. After that, the sink nodes transmit report packets again. Until {{there are no more}} packets to be delivered from the relay nodes to the sink nodes, the procedure is repeated.|$|R

[...] At present, copyright protection lasts for the author’s life plus 70 years or, {{in the case of}} anonymous works and works-for-hire, for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 from the year of creation, whichever <b>expires</b> <b>first.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{claim that}} [...] "pre-1923 works {{are in the}} public domain" [...] is correct only for {{published}} works; unpublished works are under federal copyright {{for at least the}} life of the author plus 70 years. For a work for hire, the copyright in a work created before 1978, but not theretofore in the public domain or registered for copyright, subsists from January 1, 1978, and endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever <b>expires</b> <b>first.</b> If the work was created before 1978 but first published 1978-2002, the federal copyright will not expire before 2047.|$|R

30|$|When {{the timer}} has expired, the relay node is {{expected}} to broadcast a channel reservation message to neighboring relays to prevent other relays from transmission. The relay whose timer <b>expired</b> <b>first</b> broadcasts a channel reservation message to the neighbors. Contrast to [12], in our model, {{we do not need}} to consider the channel between the source and the relay node since only the relay performs retransmission. This will reduce processing delay in relay node selection. Based on this idea, we propose a new distributed relay node selection algorithm combined with OPNC for the topology of multiple relays and multiple sink nodes. If we use channel state as the only variable to choose a relay node as in the opportunistic relaying algorithm, the system performance may be poor.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the economic lot-sizing problem with perishable items (ELS-PI), where each item has a deterministic expiration date. Although all items in stock are equivalent regardless of procurement or expiration date, we allow for an allocation mechanism that defines an {{order in which}} the items are allocated to the consumers. In particular, we {{consider the}} following allocation mechanisms: <b>First</b> Expiration, <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> (FEFO), Last Expiration, <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> (LEFO), <b>First</b> In, <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> (FIFO) and Last In, <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> (LIFO). We show that the ELS-PI can be solved in polynomial time under all four allocation mechanisms in case of no procurement capacities. This result still holds in case of time-invariant procurement capacities under the FIFO and LEFO allocation mechanisms, but the problem becomes NP-hard under the FEFO and LIFO allocation mechanisms.
