40|$|The {{operational}} {{goal of the}} ATD- 1 ConOps is {{to enable}} aircraft, using their onboard FMS capabilities, to fly Optimized Profile Descents (OPDs) from cruise to the runway threshold at a <b>high-density</b> <b>airport,</b> at a high throughput rate, using primarily speed control to maintain in-trail separation and the arrival schedule. The three technologies in the ATD- 1 ConOps achieve this by calculating a precise arrival schedule, using controller decision support tools to provide terminal controllers with speeds for aircraft to fly to meet times at a particular meter points, and onboard software providing flight crews with speeds for the aircraft to fly to achieve a particular spacing behind preceding aircraft...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{developed}} a capability for terminal area precision scheduling and spacing (TAPSS) to increase the use of fuel-efficient arrival procedures during periods of traffic congestion at a <b>high-density</b> <b>airport.</b> Sustained use of fuel-efficient procedures throughout the entire arrival phase of flight reduces overall fuel burn, greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution. The TAPSS system is a 4 D trajectory-based strategic planning and control tool that computes schedules and sequences for arrivals to facilitate optimal profile descents. This paper focuses on quantifying the efficiency benefits associated with using the TAPSS system, measured by reduction of level segments during aircraft descent and flight distance and time savings. The TAPSS system was tested {{in a series of}} human-in-the-loop simulations and compared to current procedures. Compared to the current use of the TMA system, simulation results indicate a reduction of total level segment distance by 50 % and flight distance and time savings by 7 % in the arrival portion of flight (~ 200 nm from the airport). The TAPSS system resulted in aircraft maintaining continuous descent operations longer and with more precision, both achieved under heavy traffic demand levels. I...|$|E
25|$|Despite the expansions, {{efforts have}} been made to {{restrict}} the growth of the airport. The advent of jet aircraft as well as traffic growth led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950, which resulted in the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962. To reduce congestion and drive traffic to alternative airports, the FAA imposed landing slot and perimeter restrictions on National and four other <b>high-density</b> <b>airports</b> in 1969.|$|R

The advent of jet aircraft as well as traffic growth led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950, which resulted in the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{operations and}} procedures envisioned for NASA s Air Traffic Management (ATM) Technology Demonstration # 1 (ATD- 1). The ATD- 1 Concept of Operations (ConOps) demonstration will integrate three NASA technologies to achieve high throughput, fuel-efficient arrival operations into busy terminal airspace. They are Traffic Management Advisor with Terminal Metering (TMA-TM) for precise time-based schedules to the runway and points within the terminal area, Controller-Managed Spacing (CMS) decision support tools for terminal controllers to better manage aircraft delay using speed control, and Flight deck Interval Management (FIM) avionics and flight crew procedures to conduct airborne spacing operations. The ATD- 1 concept provides de-conflicted and efficient operations of multiple arrival streams of aircraft, passing through multiple merge points, from top-of-descent (TOD) to touchdown. It also enables aircraft to conduct Optimized Profile Descents (OPDs) from en route altitude to the runway, using primarily speed control to maintain separation and schedule. The ATD- 1 project is currently addressing {{the challenges of}} integrating the three technologies, and implantation into an operational environment. Goals of the ATD- 1 demonstration include increasing the throughput of <b>high-density</b> <b>airports,</b> reducing controller workload, increasing efficiency of arrival operations {{and the frequency of}} trajectory-based operations, and promoting aircraft ADS-B equipage...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{technologies}} for airborne systems (automatic flight control, flight displays, navigation) and for ground ATC systems (digital communications, improved surveillance and tracking, automated decision-making) create {{the possibility of}} advanced ATC operations and procedures which can bring increased capacity for runway systems. A systematic analysis is carried out in this report to identify certain such advanced ATC operations, and then to evaluate the potential benefits accruing over time at typical US <b>high-density</b> <b>airports</b> (Denver and Boston). The study {{is divided into three}} parts: Part 1, "A Critical Examination of Factors Which Determine Operational Capacity of Runway Systems at Major Airports", is an intensive review of current US separation criteria and terminal area ATC operations. It identifies 11 new methods to increase the capacity of landings and takeoffs for runway systems; Part 2 - "Development of Risk Based Separation Criteria", is the development of a rational structure for establishing reduced ATC separation criteria which meet a consistent Target Level of Safety using advanced technology and operational procedures; Part 3 - "Estimation of Capacity Benefits from Advanced Terminal Area Operations - Denver and Boston", provides an estimate of the overall annual improvement in runway capacity which might be expected at Denver and Boston from using some of the advanced ATC procedures developed in Part 1. Whereas Boston achieved a substantial 37 % increase, Denver only achieved a 4. 7 % increase in its overall annual capacity.

40|$|In 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{estimated}} that U. S. commercial air carriers moved 736. 7 million passengers over 822. 3 billion revenue-passenger miles. The FAA also forecasts, {{in that same}} report, an average annual increase in passenger traffic of 2. 2 percent per {{year for the next}} 20 years, which approximates to one-and-a-half times the number of today's aircraft operations and passengers by the year 2033. If airspace capacity and throughput remain unchanged, then flight delays will increase, particularly at those airports already operating near or at capacity. Therefore it is critical to create new and improved technologies, communications, and procedures to be used by air traffic controllers and pilots. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the FAA, and the aviation industry are working together to improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System and the cost to operate in it in several ways, one of which is through the creation of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen is intended to provide airspace users with more precise information about traffic, routing, and weather, as well as improve the control mechanisms within the air traffic system. NASA's Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration- 1 (ATD- 1) Project is designed to contribute to the goals of NextGen, and accomplishes this by integrating three NASA technologies to enable fuel-efficient arrival operations into <b>high-density</b> <b>airports.</b> The three NASA technologies and procedures combined in the ATD- 1 concept are advanced arrival scheduling, controller decision support tools, and aircraft avionics to enable multiple time deconflicted and fuel efficient arrival streams in high-density terminal airspace...|$|R
