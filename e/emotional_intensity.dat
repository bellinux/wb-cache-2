He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the <b>emotional</b> <b>intensity</b> of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E

25|$|A popular {{notion is}} that people might not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events because they are simply inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there was no difference in the average <b>emotional</b> <b>intensity</b> between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Post-Second World War American {{painting}} called Abstract expressionism included {{artists like}} Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Tobey, James Brooks, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Conrad Marca-Relli, Jack Tworkov, William Baziotes, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Esteban Vicente, Hedda Sterne, Jimmy Ernst, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Theodoros Stamos, among others. American Abstract expressionism {{got its name}} in 1946 from the art critic Robert Coates. It is seen as combining the <b>emotional</b> <b>intensity</b> and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus and Synthetic Cubism. Abstract expressionism, Action painting, and Color Field painting are synonymous with the New York School.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance {{gave rise}} to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the {{balanced}} compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art {{at the dawn of the}} 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the <b>emotional</b> <b>intensity</b> of El Greco. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently, in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relation}} between perception of facial expressions and interpersonal behavior in epilepsy patients after unilateral amygdalohippocampectomy (AH). Nine patients with unilateral amygdalohippocampectomy and 14 controls completed a forced-choice emotional recognition task, in which morphed facial emotional expressions were shown at different <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities,</b> and a self-report questionnaire of interpersonal behavior. Face perception and depressive symptoms were also taken into account. Compared to normal controls, patients were less sensitive in the recognition of fearful and disgusted facial expressions, in line with previous reports. These impairments were only minimally correlated with self-report interpersonal behavior. In all, unilateral damage to the amygdala and medial temporal lobe results in subtle emotion recognition impairments, but these deficits do not appear to extend to self-reported impairments in everyday interpersonal behavior. Further studies need to explore in more detail the effects of these subtle recognition problems on daily social intercourse. ...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{problems}} {{are a key}} feature of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Also, FTLD patients show impairments in emotion processing.

Also, ceiling effects are often present on emotion recognition tasks using full-blown emotional facial expressions. In the present study with FTLD patients, we examined the perception of sadness, anger, fear, happiness, surprise and disgust at different <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities</b> on morphed facial expressions to take task difficulty into account. Results showed that our FTLD patients were specifically impaired at the recognition of the emotion anger.

40|$|Idiot {{is usually}} a term of derision. In this article, we reconsider the common meaning as {{designating}} a stupid person and return to an earlier etymology as signifying a private and independent individual. In ancient Greece, being idiotic meant engaging in the contemplative process of becoming an individual. At times, this pursuit of individuation differentiated such individuals as their acts occurred in public and were seen as absurd, out-of-the-ordinary and, frankly, idiotic, as most now know the term. With {{the widespread use of}} social media and digital video, these once private or semi-public acts of individuation often become explicitly public acts for others to see, critique and mimic. Social media has made it possible for these explorations of self to circulate where their <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities</b> resonate with or are rejected by viewers, are captured for profit by media corporations, and leveraged by their producers into media careers. Using a case study from Russian social media, this article describes the affective economy of idiotic videos and how the history of one Internet video illustrates the circulation, capture and self-capitalization attendant with neoliberalism...|$|R

40|$|The role of attentional biases {{in panic}} {{disorder}} {{has been well}} characterised. However, recent studies suggest an important effect of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs on cognitive bias and most studies have included medicated patients in their sample.

A sample of 23 untreated participants with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PPD) and 22 healthy controls (HC) were tested with a Facial Expression Recognition task featuring different <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities,</b> a Faces Dot Probe task, a Self Beliefs task and an Emotional Stroop task. PPD showed exaggerated attentional biases to negative face and word stimuli in two different paradigms and endorsed more panic-related and negative self-attributions.

40|$|This {{study used}} a morphed {{categorical}} perception facial expression task {{to evaluate whether}} patients with depression demonstrated deficits in distinguishing boundaries between emotions. Forty-one patients with depression and 41 healthy controls took part in this study. They were administered a standardized set of morphed photographs of facial expressions with varying <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities</b> between 0 % and 100 % of the emotion, in 10 % increments to provide a range of intensities from pleasant to unpleasant(e. g. happy to sad, happy to angry) and approach-avoidance (e. g. angry to fearful). Compared with healthy controls, the patients with depression demonstrated a rapid perception of sad expressions in happy-sad emotional continuum and demonstrated a rapid perception of angry expressions in angry-fearful emotional continuum. In addition, when facial expressions shifted from happy to angry, the depressed patients had a clear demarcation for the happy-angry continuum. Depressed patients had a perceptual bias towards unpleasant versus pleasant expressions and the hypersensitivity to angry facial signals might influence the interaction behaviors between depressed patients and others.

40|$|Antisocial {{individuals}} have problems recognizing negative emotions (e. g. Marsh & Blair in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 32 : 454 – 465, 2009); however, due to issues with sampling and different methods used, previous {{findings have been}} varied. Sixty-three male young offenders and 37 age-, IQ- and socio-economic status-matched male controls completed a facial emotion recognition task, which measures recognition of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise and neutral expressions across 4 <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities.</b> Conduct disorder (YSR), and psychopathic and callous/unemotional traits (YPI) were measured, and offenders’ offense data {{were taken from the}} Youth Offending Service’s case files.

A significant interaction for anger was also observed, with offenders showing reduced low- but increased high-intensity anger recognition in comparison with controls. Within the young offenders levels of conduct disorder and psychopathic traits explained variation in sadness and disgust recognition, whereas offense severity explained variation in anger recognition. These results suggest that antisocial youths show specific problems in recognizing negative emotions and support the use of targeted emotion recognition interventions for problematic behavior...|$|R

500|$|The Isis cult, {{like most}} in the Greco-Roman world, was not exclusive; worshippers of Isis could {{continue}} to revere other gods as well. Devotees of Isis were among the very few religious groups in the Greco-Roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves, loosely equivalent to [...] "Jew" [...] or [...] "Christian", that might indicate they defined themselves by their exclusive devotion to the goddess. However, the word—Isiacus or [...] "Isiac"—was rarely used. Many priests of Isis officiated in other cults as well. Several people in late Roman times, like Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, joined multiple priesthoods and underwent several initiations dedicated to different gods. Mystery initiations thus did not require devotees to abandon whatever religious identity they originally had, {{and they would not}} qualify as religious conversions under a narrow definition of the term. However, some of these initiations did involve smaller changes in religious identity, such as joining a new community of worshippers or strengthening devotees' commitment to a cult they were already part of, that would qualify as conversions in a broader sense. Many ancient sources, both written by Isiacs and by outside observers, suggest that many of Isis's devotees considered her the focus of their lives and that the cult emphasized moral purity, self-denial, and public declarations of devotion to the goddess. Joining Isis's cult was therefore a sharper change in identity than in many other mystery cults. Isiac initiation, by giving the devotee a dramatic, mystical experience of the goddess, added <b>emotional</b> <b>intensity</b> to the process.|$|E

40|$|Enhancement of {{serotonin}} neurotransmission {{plays an}} important role in the antidepressant response to agents presently available to treat depression. This response forms the major evidence for the role of serotonin in affective and social behaviour in humans. The present study investigated the effects of acute administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSR 1), citalopram (10 mg, i. v.) upon a measure of emotional processing in healthy female volunteers. Subjects completed a facial expression recognition task following infusion of citalopram or saline (between-subjects design, double-blind). Facial expressions associated with five basic emotions [...] happiness, sadness, fearfulness, anger and disgust [...] were displayed. Each face had been 'morphed' between neutral (0 %) and each emotional standard (100 %) in 10 % steps, leading to a range of <b>emotional</b> <b>intensities.</b> Mood and subjective experience were also monitored throughout the testing session. Volunteers receiving citalopram detected a higher number of facial expressions of fear and happiness, with reduced response times, relative to those given the placebo. By contrast, changes in the recognition of other basic emotions were not observed following citalopram. Notable differences in mood were also not apparent in these volunteers. These results suggest that acute administration of antidepressant drugs may affect neural processes involved in the processing of social information. This effect may represent an early acute effect of SSRIs on social and emotional processing that is relevant to their therapeutic actions...|$|R
