40|$|Investigation of the laminar-turbulent {{boundary}} {{is performed}} in a boundary-layer flow. Constant homogeneous suction is applied at the wall {{in order to prevent}} the spatial growth of the layer, leading to the parallel Asymptotic Suction Boundary Layer (ASBL). Edge tracking is {{performed in a}} large computational domain allowing for full spatial localisation of the structures on the laminar-turbulent separatrix. The obtained dynamics of the state goes through calm and bursting phases. During the latter the structure <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> size, <b>shedding</b> vortices downstream of its core which viscously decay during the calm phases. Comparison with the computation <b>in</b> spatially <b>growing</b> boundary layer is made. The influence of the Reynolds number and the path leading from the edge state to turbulent flow are considered...|$|R
40|$|Enterobacteriaceae cells <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> {{liquid media}} <b>shed</b> {{fragments}} of their outer membranes. These fragments, which may constitute a biologically important form of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin, {{have been reported}} to contain proteins, phospholipids, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In this study we compared the sizes of LPS molecules <b>in</b> <b>shed</b> membrane fragments and outer membranes from cells <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> broth cultures. Using conditional mutants of Salmonella typhimurium which incorporate specific sugars into LPS, we analyzed radiolabeled LPS by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This technique revealed that S. typhimurium LPS are more heterogeneous than previously known; molecules possessing from 0 to more than 30 O-chain repeat units were identified in outer membranes, supernatant fragments, and purified LPS. The size distributions of LPS molecules in outer membranes and supernatant fragments were similar; supernatant fragments appeared to be slightly enriched in molecules with long O-polysaccharide chains. Our results indicate the LPS molecules of many sizes are synthesized, translocated to outer membranes, and released into culture supernatants. Since the hydrophilic O-polysaccharides extend from bacterial surfaces into the aqueous environment, our findings suggest that the cell surface topography of this bacterium may be very irregular. We also speculate that heterogeneity in the degree of polymerization of O-antigenic side chains may influence the interactions of the toxic moiety of LPS (lipid A) with host constituents...|$|R
50|$|Females {{communicate}} to males by clicking their wings, {{a signal that}} they are ready for mating. After mating, females lay eggs in dead branches of small trees or shrubs; using a ovipositor to slit branch and insert eggs. Later, the eggs hatch and nymphs drop to the soil and quickly burrow and feed on the roots of plants. There are five instars <b>in</b> which nymphs <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> size by <b>shedding</b> their skins underground. Once mature (after the 3-5 year feeding period underground), the nymphs emerge from the ground through tunnel systems during the summer. They crawl up trees, grasses, shrubs, buildings, or other stable structures and shed their final skin. At this stage they are teneral, but they will dry overnight and fly away by dawn to continue the cycle. Healthy adult cicadas of this species may live {{as long as a}} two months.|$|R

40|$|Background: Use of Carica papaya leaf extracts, {{reported}} to improve thrombocyte counts in dengue patients, demands further {{analysis on the}} underlying mechanism of its thrombopoietic cytokines induction. Methods: In vitro cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) were treated with unripe papaya pulp juice (UPJ) to evaluate its potential to induce thrombopoietic cytokines (IL- 6 and SCF). Results: In vitro scratch gap closure was significantly faster (p <. 05) <b>in</b> <b>SHED</b> culture treated with UPJ. IL- 6 concentration was significantly increased (p <. 05) <b>in</b> <b>SHED</b> and PBL culture supernatant when treated with UPJ. SCF synthesis <b>in</b> <b>SHED</b> culture was also significantly increased (p <. 05) when treated with UPJ. Conclusion: In vitro upregulated synthesis of IL- 6 and SCF both <b>in</b> PBL and <b>SHED</b> reveals the potential mechanism of unripe papaya to induce thrombopoietic cytokines synthesis in cells of hematopoietic and mesenchymal origin...|$|R
