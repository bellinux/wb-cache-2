5|$|In the Ixodidae, {{the tick}} stays {{in place until}} it is {{completely}} engorged. Its weight may increase by 200 to 600 times as compared to its weight before it started feeding. To accommodate this large expansion, cell division takes place and its cuticle grows larger; the tick may remain attached for days or weeks, depending on species, life stage and <b>host.</b> <b>In</b> the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested but does not grow new cells, {{the weight of the}} tick increasing five to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.|$|E
5|$|Lollapalooza, {{an annual}} summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an {{independent}} third party negotiator, {{to avoid having}} the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 {{in the final days}} of the Daley administration. In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to <b>host</b> <b>in</b> Grant Park through 2021.|$|E

5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, {{the most formidable}} being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, partly {{on the strength of}} the Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim <b>Host</b> <b>in</b> the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian city of Innsbruck was the <b>host</b> <b>in</b> 1964. Although Innsbruck was a {{traditional}} winter sports resort, warm weather caused {{a lack of}} snow during the Games and the Austrian army was asked to transport snow and ice to the sport venues. Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by sweeping all four speed-skating events. Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes. Luge was first contested in 1964, although the sport received bad publicity when a competitor {{was killed in a}} pre-Olympic training run.|$|E
5|$|With Jacksonville's {{future as}} <b>host</b> <b>in</b> doubt, representatives from Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa, Florida, and Jacksonville visited the ACC offices to lobby {{to host the}} 2008 game. Orlando, Florida, which had been an early {{contender}} to host the 2008 game, was eliminated from consideration before the meetings took place. As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure with the poor ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000tickets remained unsold as of {{the week of the}} game and that if it was not a sellout, the game would likely not remain in Jacksonville.|$|E

5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or sparing and initiating him into the Grey Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the Taint, only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic essence within it, which is drawn to the Taint in the Grey Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the essence will survive and find a new <b>host</b> <b>in</b> the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or <b>host.</b> <b>In</b> its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a <b>host</b> <b>in</b> exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E

Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new <b>host</b> <b>in</b> exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{two other}} {{national}} flags are hoisted on flagpoles {{one at a}} time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. In Moscow during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of Los Angeles instead of the flag of the boycotting-United States. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was the next games <b>host</b> (<b>in</b> 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vancouver Canucks were {{eliminated}} from the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs several months later, Ehrhoff joined Germany for the 2010 World Championships. Germany played as tournament <b>host</b> <b>in</b> the cities of Cologne and Mannheim. Joining his team midway through the tournament, he missed the first three games before scoring a goal and an assist in six contests. Germany {{made it to the}} semifinal, where they were defeated by Russia 2–1. Ehrhoff assisted on Germany's lone goal and was named his team's player of the game. They went on to lose the bronze medal game 3–1 to Sweden. Their fourth-place finish marked their best placing at the World Championships since 1953 when they won silver. Leading Germany in average ice time with 23:34 minutes per game, Ehrhoff was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with German goaltender Dennis Endras.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man 3 {{picks up}} {{one year after}} the events of the second film. Peter is still seeing Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who like Peter is a {{photographer}} for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster later known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko is the one that killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new <b>host</b> <b>in</b> the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom.|$|E
5|$|The {{team did}} not have any rider {{highlighted}} as a favorite entering the Giro di Lombardia; pre-race analyses held Gilbert as the man to beat. Zaugg rode {{at the front of the}} race the entire day, riding off the front to occupy first position as the solo leader on the Villa Vergano climb. He then maintained his advantage on the alternating flat sections and remaining climbs (the Muro dell'Alpino and the finishing climb in Lecco), holding on for victory ahead of 's Dan Martin and 's Joaquim Rodríguez by 8 seconds. The victory was not only Zaugg's first monument classic win, or even his first single-day win, it was his first professional victory of any kind, coming at age 30. Post-race analysis compared Zaugg's triumph to some of the more notable upsets to which the race has played <b>host</b> <b>in</b> its history.|$|E
