5|$|The mass {{influx of}} {{refugees}} presented various social issues for South Vietnam.

5|$|Hammond was {{involved}} with several businesses. In 1933, to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> financial concerns, {{he took a job}} with the Cater Motor Company. He was used as a sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he was never a hard worker or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham's after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his income by working as a journalist. He wrote for The Star during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.|$|E

5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{and his son}} Cary {{traveled}} to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in September 1854 to secure an apprenticeship for Cary under noted physician Samuel D. Gross. While they were there, a yellow fever outbreak hit Fort Washington near Long Island, New York. The mayor of New York City asked Blackburn to help treat victims of the outbreak; Blackburn accepted the invitation and refused compensation for his services. When he returned home in November 1856, he found his wife Ella, who suffered from dropsy and a nervous condition, ailing with a fever. Despite Blackburn's efforts to save her, Ella Blackburn's condition worsened and she died {{before the end of}} the month. Blackburn was stricken with grief, and friends encouraged him to tour Europe, as he had often spoken of doing, to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> sorrow. He did so in early 1857, visiting hospitals in England, Scotland, France, and Germany. While in Paris, Blackburn met fellow Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill, who was traveling with her sister and niece. Blackburn and Churchill cut their journeys short, returned home, and were married in November 1857. After their honeymoon, the couple took up residence in New Orleans in January 1858, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice. A brief poem written by Blackburn indicates that the couple had a daughter named Abby, but the child apparently died as an infant, and her birth and death dates are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli was {{effectively}} an only child; his half-sister {{was not born}} until he was 14. A decade later, he discovered two half-sisters from his biological father's remarriage. His family moved around frequently due to his stepfather's work, before settling permanently in Brisbane. Tonelli's family had no history of athletic success, and had little knowledge of swimming, but his mother encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> asthma. In his first year, Tonelli came third in his age group at Western Districts Club, prompting his mother to send him at age nine to John Keatinga swimming coach who had guided several swimmers to national selectionat the Centenary Pool in the hope that he could improve to Olympic standards. Tonelli said the reality was that he could hardly swim at all. By the age of 10, Tonelli was regularly winning at school carnivals and at 11, came seventh in the 100m freestyle in his division at the Queensland Championships, before winning the event the following year. Tonelli rates his win over Stephen Holland, the future 1500m freestyle world champion and world record holder, in a 200m freestyle race at a schoolboys' carnival as his favourite race. Holland was to break his first world record just a few months later.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|But {{the cloud}} of injury hung {{constantly}} over his head. For 1974, Richmond sought to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> workload by using rookie David Cloke as a second centre half forward.

Richmond easily disposed of the upcoming North in the Grand Final and Hart held the premiership cup aloft for a second time.|$|E

25|$|In December of {{the same}} year, under public pressure, Hays elected to lift the ban. However, Arbuckle was still unable to secure work as an actor. Most exhibitors still {{declined}} to show Arbuckle's films, several of which now have no copies known to have survived intact. One of Arbuckle's feature-length films known to survive is Leap Year, which Paramount declined to release in the United States due to the scandal. It was eventually released in Europe. With Arbuckle's films now banned, in March 1922, Buster Keaton signed an agreement to give Arbuckle 35 percent of all future profits from his company, Buster Keaton Productions, to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> financial situation.|$|E

While {{working for}} German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter & Gamble) in 1982, Mateschitz traveled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of TC Pharmaceutical. He {{found that the}} energy drink Krating Daeng, developed by Chaleo's company during the 1970s, helped to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> jet lag. After seeing market potential in the drink, he partnered with Chaleo in bringing it to Europe. Under their agreement, the partners invested $500,000 each into founding Red Bull GmbH. In return, they would each receive a 49% stake in the company, with the remaining 2% stake going to Chaleo's son Chalerm. They also agreed that Mateschitz would run the company.|$|E

Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan {{to do the things that}} Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.|$|E

25|$|The {{motivation}} for this violent rejection {{of his earlier}} self {{is the subject of}} considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.|$|E
25|$|In 1701 Mehmed Pasha Kurd Bayram was {{appointed}} {{governor of the}} Jerusalem, Gaza and Nablus sanjaks. During his term, he launched repeated punitive expeditions against the peasantry and Bedouin tribesmen for rebelling against his authority, refusing to pay his increased taxes (Mehmed Pasha doubled the tax rate after entering into office) or, in the specific case of the Bedouin, for taking over local highways and imposing tolls on travelers. The campaigns were often brutal. In 1702, his campaign against the Bedouin and peasants in the Gaza and Jerusalem sanjaks resulted in 200 deaths among the Bedouin and peasants. In early 1703, he besieged the fortress town of Bayt Jibrin where rebels from the vicinity had barricaded themselves. Several villages were destroyed before Mehmed Pasha gained control of the town. Following the siege, the ulama of Jerusalem requested that Mehmed Pasha <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> stringent taxation policies and militarism, but their requests were ignored.|$|E
25|$|At age 21 Holliday {{earned a}} degree in {{dentistry}} from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. He set up practice in Atlanta, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the American Southwest would <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day. Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations. While in Texas, he saved Wyatt Earp's life and they became friends. In 1880, he joined Earp in Las Vegas, New Mexico and then rode with him to Prescott, Arizona, and then Tombstone. In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys gang repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a stage. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal Virgil Earp. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys, which resulted in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.|$|E

25|$|In 1642, in {{an effort}} to <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> father's endless, {{exhausting}} calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.|$|E
25|$|Superhuman Strength: In human form, Michael is able {{to fully}} stop a truck that had just {{initiated}} its brakes, can break steel chains and rip a first aid kit box from a wall. When changed to his Hybrid form, Michael's strength increases significantly. He holds his ground against Viktor, a centuries-old Vampire Elder, in physical combat immediately following the transformation, taking the Elder by surprise with his incredible speed and strength before ultimately falling prey to Viktor's much greater combat experience and superior battle technique. Although Michael {{is one of the}} most physically powerful beings of the series, his lack of combat experience tends to put him at a disadvantage when facing particularly experienced combatants, though his raw strength, speed and rage is often enough to compensate for this when facing the average Vampire or Lycan; Viktor is the only non-Hybrid being that Michael couldn't defeat due to Viktor's vast combat experience as an Elder Vampire. He can also punch through a Werewolf's chest with <b>ease.</b> <b>His</b> strength is so great that he {{is able to}} kill William, the first Werewolf in existence (who had been weakened by centuries without sustenance), by tearing his head in half with his bare hands, despite having recently recovered from being impaled by Markus. He also holds his own against another Hybrid, Markus, despite the latter's status as the eldest of the Vampires.|$|E
25|$|Paul suffers some {{financial}} difficulties with his businesses – Lassiter's Hotel and PirateNet, a local radio station. To help <b>ease</b> <b>his</b> problems, he transfers $100,000 from the Lassiter's Corporation into the PirateNet accounts and tells his wife, Rebecca, {{that it is}} from an anonymous benefactor. Rebecca's son, Declan, believes Paul has been embezzling money from Lassiter's and contacts Diana Marshall about his suspicions. Diana is sent to Erinsborough to investigate Paul's dealings, on behalf of Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who owns a significant stake in Lassiter's. Paul hires Toadfish Rebecchi to be his lawyer and Toadie discovers Paul's embezzlement. Paul tries to cover up what he has done, but his son, Andrew, accidentally gives Diana proof of the crime. After learning that Diana knows everything, Paul asks her {{to join him in}} taking over the company. To prove to her that he is serious, Paul has sex with her, but Diana tells him that she is going to take his job. Paul hires a private investigator to bug Toadie's phone in the hope of finding something to blackmail him with. He learns that Toadie is helping Stephanie Scully to cover up {{the fact that she is}} pregnant by her best friend's husband. Paul then asks Toadie to make it look like Diana embezzled the money instead. Toadie later agrees to help Diana bring Paul down. Paul learns Toadie and Diana are working together, so to punish Toadie, he reveals his and Steph's secret over the radio.|$|E
