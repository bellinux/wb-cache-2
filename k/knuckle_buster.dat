50|$|Junko â€” A large, albeit {{gentle and}} good-natured person, Junko {{is a member}} of a species known as Wallops. He has greenish-blue hair and grey eyes and his {{appearance}} {{is similar to that of}} a brown anthropomorphized rhino. As the muscle of the Storm Hawks he possesses superhuman strength that is greatly increased by the use of his preferred weapons, the <b>Knuckle</b> <b>Busters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another note of {{interest}} is that the B.I.G. demo contained an additional demo screen entitled [...] "The Digital Department" [...] containing 6 digital versions of C64 music. The sound routine however used each channel of the YM2149 as a 4-bit DAC and played samples for each instrument. This {{is the first time}} ADSR samples are heard on the Atari ST, unfortunately only one more piece of music is ever written using this routine, albeit the 16-minute-long <b>Knuckle</b> <b>Busters</b> tune by Rob Hubbard. This appears as a guest screen in the Cuddly Demos (written by The Carebears) and was used to torment Richard Karsmakers of ST News who was promptly chained to a chair as the disk was formatted before his very eyes! ...|$|R
