25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite reusing some scripts {{from other}} sources, Perrin {{said that he}} and Sheekman [...] "had [...] hands full turning out a script each week". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, [...] " [...] was in the men's room during a break, and he was {{complaining}} to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, I wish we could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "This Is The Life" [...] {{had already}} been {{recorded}} and released as a single in November1984. The song describes the narrator's overly lavish lifestyle and had originally been commissioned for the gangster spoof movie Johnny Dangerously. The album's title track, [...] "Dare to Be Stupid", is an ode to living life stupidly. According to the liner notes of , the song represents [...] "Al's motto in life". The song is a style parody of the band Devo. Devo's reaction was very positive. [...] Yankovic said, [...] "Right after I finished [...] "Dare To Be Stupid", <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to Mark Mothersbaugh's house and played it for him. He seemed to enjoy it a lot." [...] The song was later released on the soundtrack to the 1986 film [...] Yankovic later mused that more people were introduced to [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] the song through the Transformers movie than through the actual Dare to Be Stupid album itself.|$|E
500|$|During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed {{increasing}} {{popularity in}} Britain. In January, their second single, [...] "Please Please Me", followed [...] "Love Me Do" [...] into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars earned them favourable reviews, {{leading to a}} boost in sales and radio play. By {{the end of the}} year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on The Ed Sullivan Show to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: [...] "In the states I know <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads." [...] He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's [...] "I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye" [...] and Rolf Harris's [...] "Ringo for President". In 1964, [...] "I love Ringo" [...] lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising. Furthermore, Starr's insistence on prominently placing the logo of the company that made his prize American import drum kit, Ludwig Drums, on his bass drum gave it a such burst of publicity that the company became a dominant manufacturer of drums for twenty years.|$|E

2500|$|After {{having spent}} over two hours {{recording}} the A-side and then taking a break, [...] "Kung Fu Fighting" [...] was recorded {{quickly in the}} last ten minutes of studio time, in only two takes, due to a three-hour time constraint for the entire session. According to Biddu, [...] "Kung Fu Fighting was the B-side so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the top on the 'huhs' and the 'hahs' and the chopping sounds. It was a B-side: who was going to listen?" [...] After hearing both songs, Robin Blanchflower of Pye Records insisted that [...] "Kung Fu Fighting" [...] be the A-side instead.|$|E

I just saw him there, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> and got him, that was it." [...] The events were first reported by the Australian press on 12 December 2008 following a briefing by Major General Tim McOwan on 11 December. At this stage Donaldson was identified only as [...] "Trooper F". Donaldson then became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia on 16 January 2009; he was presented with the medal by the Governor-General at a ceremony in Government House, Canberra.|$|E

I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wrote a quick script which I was not {{particularly}} enamored with myself," [...] Hill said. However it attracted the interest of Paul Newman and John Huston. [...] "One {{would like to think}} you are mistaken about the wonders of your work, but I didn't believe it," [...] he said. [...] "That part turned out to be true. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, I ended up with sole screen credit, but {{one of the problems is}} the screen credit is misleading very often. I wrote 90% of the first half, various people wrote the rest. I didn't think it was a very good film. Hill says he never saw the final product, but was told it was [...] "a real bomb".|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

2500|$|Cousins won the Brownlow Medal, the AFL's highest {{individual}} player award, on 19 September 2005 with 20 votes, {{ahead of}} teammate Daniel Kerr on 19 votes and Nick Dal Santo on 18 votes. Cousins was the favourite to win with bookmakers, after five previous top-10 finishes. He {{did not attend}} the award ceremony in Melbourne, remaining in Perth to prepare for West Coast's Grand Final match against Sydney Swans the following weekend. His celebration was [...] "very quiet, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the bar, bought the folks a bottle of champagne, had one lemonade and went up to the (hotel) room. I managed to get to sleep before midnight, which was a bonus." [...] West Coast's last training session in Perth before travelling to their first Grand Final game since 1994 was attended by 3,000 fans. Trevor Nesbitt, West Coast's chief executive, said he expected that the combination of the team's Grand Final appearance, Cousins' Brownlow win, and Chris Judd's Brownlow win in the previous year, would lead to a turnover of around $2million in club merchandise. Nesbitt added: ...|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
