40|$|Abstract — Human <b>grasps,</b> {{especially}} whole-hand <b>grasps,</b> {{are difficult}} to animate {{because of the high}} number of degrees of freedom of the hand and the need for the hand to conform naturally to the object surface. Captured human motion data provides us with a rich source of examples of natural <b>grasps.</b> However, for each new object, we are faced with the problem of selecting the best <b>grasp</b> from the database and adapting it to that object. This paper presents a data-driven approach to <b>grasp</b> synthesis. We begin with a database of captured human <b>grasps.</b> To identify candidate <b>grasps</b> for a new object, we introduce a novel shape matching algorithm that matches hand shape to object shape by identifying collections of features having similar relative placements and surface normals. This step returns many <b>grasp</b> candidates, which are clustered and pruned by choosing the <b>grasp</b> best suited for the intended task. For pruning undesirable <b>grasps,</b> we develop an anatomically based <b>grasp</b> quality measure specific to the human hand. Examples of <b>grasp</b> synthesis are shown for a variety of objects not present in the original database. This algorithm should be useful both as an animator tool for posing the hand and for automatic <b>grasp</b> synthesis in virtual environments.

40|$|Abstract — Generalising {{dexterous}} <b>grasps</b> to novel objects {{is an open}} problem. We {{show how}} to learn <b>grasps</b> for high DoF hands that generalise to novel objects, given as little as one demonstrated <b>grasp.</b> During <b>grasp</b> learning two types of probability density are learned that model the demonstrated <b>grasp.</b> The first density type (the contact model) models the relationship of an individual finger part to local surface features at its contact point. The second density type (the hand configu-ration model) models the whole hand configuration during the approach to <b>grasp.</b> When presented with a new object, many candidate <b>grasps</b> are generated, and a kinematically feasible <b>grasp</b> is selected that maximises the product of these densities. We demonstrate 31 successful <b>grasps</b> on novel objects (an 86 % success rate), transferred from 16 training <b>grasps.</b> The method enables: transfer of dexterous <b>grasps</b> within object categories; across object categories; to and from objects {{where there is no}} complete model of the object available; and using two different dexterous hands.

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at <b>grasping</b> and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the <b>grasping</b> of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates.

5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, <b>grasping</b> forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, {{including}} the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the <b>grasping</b> apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} compared <b>grasps</b> to real surfaces with <b>grasps</b> to virtual surfaces, {{and used}} virtual surfaces {{to examine the}} role of cues to surface shape in <b>grasp.</b> The first experiment investigated the kinematics of overhand <b>grasps</b> to real and virtual objects. The results showed that compared to <b>grasps</b> to real surfaces, <b>grasps</b> to virtual objects were different in the deceleration phase and were more variable in their endpoint position. The second experiment examined how, for several real and virtual surface conditions, {{the decision to use}} either an over or underhand <b>grasp</b> switched as a function of object orientation and compared these results with data obtained for visual matching of orientation to the same stimuli. The decision to switch between types of <b>grasp</b> showed no difference between actual <b>grasp</b> movements and verbal reports of <b>grasp</b> choice that were not accompanied by arm movement. It was also found that variability in the decision to switch between over and under hand <b>grasps</b> was correlated to variability in visual matching of orientation. The third experiment used virtual surfaces to examine how the removal of visual cues to shape affected the decision to switch from over to underhand <b>grasp.</b> Results showed that the orientation at which the decision switched was dependent on the visual information content. In summary, it was shown that <b>grasps</b> were affected by the information available in virtual surfaces and that, compared with real surfaces, <b>grasps</b> to virtual surfaces appear identical in choice of a <b>grasp</b> type, but differ in the kinematics of the execution of the <b>grasp...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} underactuation is {{increasingly}} applied to hand prostheses because it minimizes {{the number of}} actuators while the fingers are adaptive to the <b>grasped</b> objects. However, current underactuated <b>grasp</b> mechanisms suffer from an intrinsic stability problem which disables them to obtain a pinch <b>grasp,</b> hence they fail to <b>grasp</b> small objects. In an attempt {{to solve this problem}} joint locks are applied to an underactuated pulley-tendon driven hand. Joint locks might also {{have an effect on the}} power <b>grasp</b> strength. Therefore the effect of joint locks on the pinch <b>grasp</b> performance and power <b>grasp</b> strength of underactuated hand prostheses is investigated. This effect is quantified by two <b>grasp</b> performance metrics: the ability to pinch and the ability to hold. To find the optimal joint lock configurations for pinch <b>grasp</b> performance and power <b>grasp</b> strength, the effect of different joint lock configurations on both performance metrics is calculated using a static <b>grasp</b> model. The results of this model are validated by measurements on a prototype. Both the model and the measurements showed that joint locks do not have a significant effect on the pinch <b>grasp</b> performance when only the range of object sizes for which a pinch <b>grasp</b> equilibrium exists is considered. However, the measurements showed that a pinch <b>grasp</b> is more easily established with joint locks.
