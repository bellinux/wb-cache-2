50|$|Pyroxamine (INN), {{also known}} as {{pyroxamine}} maleate (USAN) (developmental code names AHR-224, NSC-64540), is an antihistamine and anticholinergic related to <b>diphenylpyraline.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenylpyraline</b> (DPP; sold as Allergen, Arbid, Belfene, Diafen, Hispril, Histyn, Lergobine, Lyssipol, Mepiben, Neargal) is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} with anticholinergic {{effects of}} the diphenylpiperidine class. It is marketed in Europe {{for the treatment of}} allergies. DPP has also been found to act as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and produces hyperactivity in rodents.

50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, <b>diphenylpyraline,</b> etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E

The sensitivity of GC-SID was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of GC-nitrogen-phosphorus detection. A detailed procedure for isolation of the drugs from human whole blood and urine with use of Sep-Pak C 18 cartridges before GC-SID is also presented.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{commonly}} used H 1 antihistamines on nasal vascular and airway resistances were {{studied in the}} dog. Promethazine hydrochloride decreased nasal vascular resistance but increased nasal airway resistance in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Diphenylpyraline</b> hydrochloride in low doses increased nasal vascular resistance without much affecting nasal airway resistance while in high doses it decreased nasal vascular resistance but increased nasal airway resistance. Chlorpheniramine maleate in low doses increased nasal vascular resistance but decreased airway resistance while in high doses it decreased nasal vascular resistance without much affecting nasal airway resistance. It was concluded that different H 1 antihistamines might exert vasoconstrictor or vasodilatatory action on both the resistance and capacitance vessels of the nasal vascular bed {{depending on the type}} and the dose of drug used. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{mononuclear}} Mn(II) complexes of {{the type}} [Mn(L) n(H 2 O) 2 Cl 2] (where n = 1 or 2) were prepd. with biol. important drugs viz.

The molar conductance measurement of all the complexes in DMF soln. corresponds to non-electrolytic nature. All complexes were of the high-spin type and found to have six-coordinate octahedral geometry. The antimicrobial activity of these complexes has been screened against two gram-pos. and two gram-neg. bacteria.

40|$|A simple {{extraction}} {{method is}} presented for meperidine (pethidine) in {{human whole blood}} and urine using headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) with <b>diphenylpyraline</b> as internal standard (IS). Clear supernatant of whole blood after deproteinization, and untreated urine, containing meperidine and IS, were heated at 100 °C {{in the presence of}} NaOH and NaCl in a vial with a silicone septum cap; and then an SPME fiber was exposed in the headspace of a vial to allow adsorption of the drugs before gas chromatography. Recoveries of meperidine were 3 % for whole blood and 18 % for urine. Calibration curve for whole blood samples was linear in the range of 0. 125 - 1 μg/ml. The equation and ｒ value 0 for the curve were: y= 0. 375 x + 0. 0378 and r= 0. 993.

40|$|Thirteen {{antihistaminic}} {{drugs and}} their analogues are tested for their extraction by headspace solid-phase microextraction from {{human whole blood}} and urine. Their determination is made by using capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Relatively high recoveries are obtained for terodiline, diphenhydramine, <b>diphenylpyraline,</b> and orphenadrine in urine; but the recoveries in blood extracts are 4 – 51 times lower than those in urine extracts for all drugs. Benactyzine and piperilate are not suited for the extraction method. The calibration curves are drawn for four drugs spiked to whole blood and for eleven drugs spiked to urine; excellent linearity is confirmed for the drugs. The detection limits for the drugs are 76 – 473 ng/mL in blood and 13 – 186 ng/mL in urine. Diphenhydramine is determined for whole blood obtained from a male subject who had received oral administration of 30 mg diphenhydramine–HC 1150 min before the sampling; the concentrations of the drug are 0. 12 and 1. 22 μg/mL for blood and urine, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of monitoring trace levels of cyproheptadine (CYP) residues in complicated biological matrices, specific adsorption materials for the preconcentration and clean-up of CYP are indispensable. In this work, CYP was extracted from urine using dummy molecularly imprinted SPE (DMISPE) to avoid leakage of the imprinting molecules during the desorption phase. For synthesis of DMISPE, azatadine (AZA) was employed as the dummy template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker, 2, 2 '-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as the initiator, and dichloromethane as the porogen solvent. An LC-MS/MS method was used to analyze CYP. Two MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) transitions for each analyte were monitored using <b>diphenylpyraline</b> hydrochloride (DPP. HCl), which was used as an internal standard. The advantages of DMISPE include obtaining less complex chromatograms and reducing ion suppression in ESI. The process efficiencies for DMISPE and SPE were 80 % and 12 %, respectively. In addition, the demonstrated reusability of the DMISPE cartridges is an advantage compared with single-use SPE cartridges or immunoaffinity materials...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that the anaphylactic reaction might be caused principally by chemical substances released from the tissues {{as a result of}} antigen-antibody reaction. Atria isolated from guinea pigs sensitized by egg-albumin were mainly used for this experiment. When the sensitized atrium and the non-sensitized guinea-pig's ileum were suspended together in the same bath, there appeared strong contraction of the ileum along with the provocation of anaphylaxis in the sensitized atrium. Although such contraction of ileum was abolished almost completely by diphenhydramine or <b>diphenylpyraline,</b> the atrial anaphylaxis was not affected. The anaphylactic reaction was also evoked by perfusing solution containing the antigen. However, the atrial anaphylaxis showed little influence on the contractile tension of the non-sensitized atrium suspended together in the same bath. The above facts suggest that the anaphylactic contraction would not be caused solely by mediators, including hitherto unknown chemical substances. So the further attempt was carried out to examine in vitro the site of antigen-antibody interaction in the atrium by using the antigen labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The specific fluorescence about the muscle cells was observed along their boundary of the highly sensitized atrium. Through the results in these experiments, together with the reports from our laboratory, it could be assumed that in the atrial anaphylaxis the antigen-antibody reaction itself induces some changes on the cell membrane leading to muscular contraction...|$|E
