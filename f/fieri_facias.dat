25|$|If a {{plaintiff}} was successful before the court, the plaintiff could obtain a warrant of execution against the defendant's goods and chattels (called <b>fieri</b> <b>facias).</b> This in effect allowed the Provost Marshal {{to seize the}} defendant’s goods and sell them, subsequently paying the proceeds to the plaintiff. Alternatively, the defendant could be imprisoned until the debt and costs were satisfied. As in English law, the plaintiff was required to maintain the debtor in prison by paying what was called groats. The defendant could say on oath {{that he had no}} means of maintaining himself in prison. If this occurred, the plaintiff had to provide maintenance for him in prison according to the order of the Court. If the amount ordered by the court was not paid for one week, the debtor could be discharged from prison and also discharged from the debt.|$|E
60|$|If the Sheriff be in {{possession}} by <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> for debt immediately {{due to the}} king, the officer, however, shall quit his possession to the commissioners, and they shall see the king's debt fully satisfied before any division {{be made to the}} creditors.|$|E
50|$|Writs of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> are renamed writs of control. Warrants of {{execution}} and warrants of distress are renamed warrants of control. Writs of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> de bonis ecclesiasticis are unaffected. (s. 62).|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, the writ of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias,</b> {{except for}} writs of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> de bonis ecclesiasticis, was renamed to writ of control by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 on 6 April 2014.|$|E

5000|$|A writ of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> (colloquially [...] "fi fa") {{commands}} {{a sheriff}} {{to take and}} auction off enough property from a losing party to pay the debt (plus interest and costs) owed by a judgment debtor.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fieri</b> <b>facias,</b> usually {{abbreviated}} fi. fa. (Latin {{for that}} you cause to be made) is a {{writ of execution}} after judgment obtained in a legal action for debt or damages for the sheriff to levy on goods of the judgment debtor.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} system of warrants of execution and writs of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> was increasingly considered as cumbersome, confusing and old-fashioned. Further, general concern about unlawful, violent and threatening behaviour by bailiffs {{led to a}} Department for Constitutional Affairs White Paper proposing modernisation and regulation.|$|E
5000|$|This writ {{was once}} so common that <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> became a slang {{term for a}} sheriff, with a pun on the [...] "fiery ruddy face" [...] of {{habitual}} drunkenness, or for anyone with a ruddy complexion.(Abraham Cowley's Poem Drinking - [...] "By's Drunken fiery face no less") ...|$|E
5000|$|A warrant of {{execution}} can be issued in the County Court to recover a debt between £50 (£600 if the debtor is in Scotland) and £5,000. If amount sought {{is more than}} £600 it can be enforced in the High Court using a writ of <b>Fieri</b> <b>Facias</b> (often called Fi. Fa.) ...|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong statute (High Court Ordinance (Cap 4) s 21D(1)) {{provides}} {{that money and}} banknotes, government stock, bonds and other securities for money are amenable to attachment and sale though <b>fieri</b> <b>facias.</b> But {{with reference to the}} English case Alleyne v Darcy (1855) 5 I Ch R 56, securities for money do not include life insurance policies.|$|E
50|$|Sections 15 was {{repealed}} by the Schedule to the Sale of Goods Act 1893, but section 26 that act continued the requiment that <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> or other {{writ of execution}} are effective against goods from when they are given to the sheriff and the sheriff shall endorce the writ with the date and time he received it.|$|E
50|$|Section 15 {{provides}} that <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> or other writs of execution are effective against goods {{from the date}} given it {{is given to the}} sheriff and the sheriff shall write on the back of it the day, month and year he received it without a fee.

5000|$|In turn, Hendren {{sold the}} {{operation}} in 1955 to Eddie Moran, of Monroe, Louisiana, {{where it was}} based in its final years. In 1956, it {{was reported to be}} still trading under Wolcott's name and [...] "playing under canvas and making mostly one-day stands... bringing live entertainment of a style most show people don't dream still exists and flourishes." [...] The show at that time featured the blues singer Mary Smith and the comedian Memphis Lewis and had a payroll of 50, including a ten-strong band. Performances included [...] "up-to-the-minute rock-and-roll" [...] and an [...] "exotic dancer". Records suggest that the company's last performance was in 1959. The company's trucks, buses and trailers were seized by the sheriff of Ouachita Parish in Monroe in 1960, under a writ of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias,</b> and sold.|$|E

5000|$|Elegit (Latin for he has chosen) was, in English law, a {{judicial}} writ of execution, {{given by the}} Statute of Westminster II (1285), and so called from {{the words of the}} writ, that the plaintiff has chosen (elegit) this mode of satisfaction. Previously to the Statute of Westminster II, a judgment creditor could only have the profits of lands of a debtor in satisfaction of his judgment, but not the possession of the lands themselves. But this statute provided that henceforth it should be in the election of the party having recovered judgment to have a writ of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> unto the sheriff on lands and goods or else ail the chattels of the debtor and the one half of his lands until the judgment be satisfied. Since the Bankruptcy Act 1883 the writ of elegit has extended to lands and hereditaments only.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} five sections regulated {{a variety}} of court practices. Section 4, as requested by Washington, dealt with who could take bail payments. Section 5 made rules for writs of ne exeat and of injunction; the rules for injunctions, such as requiring notice to {{the target of the}} injunction, and barring federal injunctions from stopping state court activities, remain largely in effect to this day and are perhaps this bill's most lasting legacy. [...] Section 6 authorised inter-district subpoenas, but these were not to require witnesses in civil cases to travel over 100 miles. Section 7 authorised courts to make their own rules; this codified existing practice, and was a reaction to a House amendment aimed at giving the Supreme Court rule-making authority over all the courts. Section 8 ordered that appraisals of property seized in execution of writs of <b>fieri</b> <b>facias</b> should follow the same rules as appraisals made for the relevant state courts.|$|E
50|$|The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It {{provides}} for several diverse matters {{relating to the}} law, some of them being significant changes {{to the structure of}} the courts and fundamental legal procedures. Part 1 provides a scheme for radical overhaul of the tribunal system in the UK, creating a new unified structure with two new tribunals to embrace the former fragmented scheme, along with a Senior President of Tribunals. Part 2 defines new criteria for appointment as a judge, generally reducing the length of experience required with the aim of increasing diversity in the judiciary. Part 3 creates a new system of taking control of goods in order to enforce judgments and abolishes ancient common law writs and remedies such as <b>fieri</b> <b>facias,</b> replevin and distress for rent. It introduces a modern system of 'certified enforcement agents' and 'exempted enforcement agents' which includes civil servants such as court officers and County Court Bailiffs, civilian enforcement officers and police officers. Part 4 makes some changes to attachment of earnings and charging orders to make recovery of debts more straightforward. Part 5 makes some changes to insolvency practice in order to provide low-cost protection for people who have previously been excluded owing to their small debts and lack of assets. Part 6 provides protection from seizure for foreign antiquities and artefacts on display in the UK and whose provenance is alleged to be broken by misappropriation. Such artefacts can only be seized on a court order that was compelled by a Community obligation or a treaty obligation.|$|E
40|$|The Law of Judgments and the {{jurisdiction}} of the sheriff in selling land, considered with reference to the complaints of the County Down people on the subject: (1) that the Law of Judgments operates unequally and harshly on leasehold interests and upon yearly tenancies, (2) That {{the jurisdiction}} of the sheriff in selling leasehold and yearly tenancies under the writ of ?<b>fieri</b> <b>facias?</b> is burdensome and oppressive, (3) That the creditor who involves the tenant in the heaviest law costs can get an unjust priority over other creditors, (4) That the judgment creditor can in many cases confiscate the rights of the widowed mother and the younger brothers and sisters of the tenant, (5) That sales by ?<b>fieri</b> <b>facias?</b> is a new procedure that has sprung out of the Land Ac...|$|E
