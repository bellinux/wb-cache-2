To stabilize the lasing wavelength, a diffraction grating is etched close to the p-n junction of the diode. This grating acts like an optical filter, causing a single wavelength to be fed back to the gain region and lase. Since the grating provides the feedback that is required for lasing, reflection from the facets is not required. Thus, at least one facet of a DFB is anti-reflection coated. The <b>DFB</b> <b>laser</b> has a stable wavelength that is set during manufacturing by the pitch of the grating, and can only be tuned slightly with temperature.

40|$|In {{this final}} report, we report the first {{analysis}} and experimental demonstration of tunable microwave/millimeter wave signal generation in two-section gain-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers.</b> Continuous tuning from 20 to 64 GHz was directly observed and characterized {{both in the}} electrical and optical domain. The mechanism of microwave generation in two-section gain-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers</b> {{is different from that}} of two-section index-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers</b> previously reported. As a result, gain coupling can lead to simultaneous large modulation indexes and high frequencies in two-section <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers.</b> Optical generation of microwave/millimeter-wave signals has potential applications in optical subcarrier multiplexing [1, 2], photonic link signal mixing [3, 4], all-optical clock recovery [5] and generation of high-bit rate soliton-like sources [6 - 8]. The highest frequency so far was generated in two-section strongly index-coupled (K = 300 cm~l) <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers</b> [9]. It is believed that the mechanism for the generation of microwave signals is due to nonlinear mode beating through nonlinear interactions of the exchanged photons with the carriers in the active media of both sections [10]. The modulation index of these microwave signals is expected to be rather low because of the small overlap of the modes. The stronger the DFB grating (i. e., the larger the value of K) the smaller the modulation index [10]. Therefore, {{it would be difficult to}} experimentally generate microwave signals with large modulation index in two-section index-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers.</b> We report in this letter the generation of microwave signals in two-section gain-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers.</b> Our simulation indicates that the nonlinear mode-beating mechanism of microwave generation in two-section gain-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers</b> is different from that of two-section index-coupled <b>DFB</b> <b>lasers</b> previously reported.

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is a}} phase-shifted <b>DFB</b> <b>laser.</b> In this case both facets are anti-reflection coated {{and there is a}} phase shift in the cavity. This could be a single 1/4 wave shift {{at the center of the}} cavity, or multiple smaller shifts distributed in the cavity. Such devices have much better reproducibility in wavelength and theoretically all lase in single mode.|$|E
50|$|<b>DFB</b> <b>laser</b> diodes {{do not use}} two {{discrete}} mirrors to {{form the}} optical cavity (as they are used in conventional laser designs). The grating acts as the wavelength selective element {{for at least one}} of the mirrors and provides the feedback, reflecting light back into the cavity to form the resonator. The grating is constructed so as to reflect only a narrow band of wavelengths, and thus produce a single longitudinal lasing mode. This is in contrast to a Fabry-Perot Laser, where the facets of the chip form the two mirrors and provide the feedback. In that case, the mirrors are broadband and either the laser functions at multiple longitudinal modes simultaneously or easily jumps between longitudinal modes. Altering the temperature of the device causes the pitch of the grating to change due to the dependence of refractive index on temperature. This dependence is caused by a change in the semiconductor laser's bandgap with temperature and thermal expansion. A change in the refractive index alters the wavelength selection of the grating structure and thus the wavelength of the laser output, producing a wavelength tunable laser or TDL (Tunable Diode Laser). The tuning range is usually of the order of 6 nm for a ~50 K (90 °F) change in temperature, while the linewidth of a <b>DFB</b> <b>laser</b> is a few megahertz. Altering of the current powering the laser will also tune the device, as a current change causes a temperature change inside the device. Integrated DFB lasers are often used in optical communication applications, such as DWDM where a tunable laser signal is desired as well as in sensing where extreme narrow line width is required, or in gas sensing applications, where the signal of the absorbing gas is detected while wavelength tuning the <b>DFB</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
