Significant numbers of Asian, specifically Chinese and Japanese, people have moved to Barbados, but their music is unstudied and <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> impact on Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Lakefront Station is an Amtrak {{train station}} at North Coast Harbor in Cleveland, Ohio. The station {{was built in}} 1977 to provide service to the Lake Shore Limited route, which was {{reinstated}} by Amtrak via Cleveland and Toledo in 1975. It replaced service to Cleveland Union Terminal. Lakefront Station is a modern station located in downtown Cleveland near the Lake Erie waterfront, adjacent to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway and {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Steamship William G. Mather Museum, and FirstEnergy Stadium. The station <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> to no renovation since its opening.|$|E

25|$|The {{country is}} {{represented}} in association football by the Andorra national football team. However, the team <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success internationally because of Andorra's small population. Football is ruled in Andorra by the Andorran Football Federation founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football (Primera Divisió, Copa Constitució and Supercopa) and futsal. FC Andorra, a club based in Andorra la Vella founded in 1942, compete in the Spanish football league system.|$|E
25|$|A {{feral cat}} is a cat that lives {{outdoors}} and <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> or no human contact. They {{do not allow}} themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and will run away if they are able. They typically remain hidden from humans, although some feral cats become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them. Even with long term attempts at socialization, feral cats usually remain fearful and avoidant of humans.|$|E

It is about half finished and writing may have been interrupted by his death in 1637.

It <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> impact on the Robin Hood tradition but needs mention as the work of a major dramatist.|$|E
25|$|Since Chao'an, Raoping and Jieyang border the Hakka-speaking {{region in}} the north, some people in these regions speak Hakka, though they can usually speak Chaozhou as well.

Similarly, in Dabu and Fengshun, where the Chaozhou- and Hakka-speaking regions meet, Chaozhou is also spoken although Hakka remains the primary form of Chinese spoken there.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{presently}} representing only a {{small percentage}} of the economy, a considerable part of continental Portugal is dedicated to agriculture. The South has developed an extensive monoculture of cereals and olive trees and the Douro Valley of vineyards. Olive trees (4,000km2; 1,545sqmi), vineyards (3,750km2; 1,450sqmi), wheat (3,000km2; 1,160sqmi) and maize (2,680km2; 1,035sqmi) are produced in vast areas. Portuguese wine and olive oil are especially praised by nationals for their quality, thus external competition (even at much lower prices) <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect on consumer demand.|$|E

25|$|The Florida cowhunter or cracker cowboy {{tradition}} gradually assimilated {{to western}} cowboy tradition during the 20th century (although the vaquero tradition <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> influence in Florida). Texas tick fever and the screw-worm {{were introduced to}} Florida in the early 20th century by cattle entering from other states. These pests forced Florida cattlemen to separate individual animals from their herds at frequent intervals for treatment, which {{eventually led to the}} widespread use of lassos. Florida cowboys continue to use dogs and bullwhips for controlling cattle.|$|E
25|$|While the {{government}} generally respects {{the human rights}} of its citizens, serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations {{in the southern part of}} the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods. The National Human Rights Commission <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations. By law, all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and humane treatment; however, the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E

By comparison, Batman v Superman (2016) made only $330,360,194. DC Comics <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> creative control over these in movies: When Warner Bros. sold the movie rights to Superman to the Salkinds in 1974, it demanded control over the budget and the casting, but left everything else to the producers' discretion.|$|E

The adoption by Supreme Council of the BSSR of the declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus on 1990 was a turning point on the development of the state. It has also been in a supranational union with Russia since 2 April 1996, although this <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> practical effect.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches have {{as their}} theological, spiritual, and liturgical {{patrimony}} {{the traditions of}} Eastern Christianity.

The primary patristic theologian of the Western Church, Augustine of Hippo whose influence advance such theological concepts as original sin and ex opere operato <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> influence on the Christian East, making for differences in baptismal theology, Mariology, and sacramental theology. Likewise, medieval Western scholasticism, that of Thomas Aquinas in particular, which was largely based on Augustine, also had little reception in the East.|$|E
