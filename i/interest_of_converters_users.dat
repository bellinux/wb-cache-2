40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{procedure}} for the correction of scan converter-based transient digitizers. The procedure includes two main phases: an experimental characterization for identifying the actual distortion model, and a correction for compensating errors directly on the converter output. The characterization {{is based on a}} dc generator; thus, the proposed procedure can be implemented as a self-correction technique by using the internal reference offset source of the scan digitizer. If periodically carried out, the procedure allows the influence of thermal effects on semiconductor diodes of target matrix to be significantly reduced. The procedure and the experimental results of its application to an actual digitizer have been made available to a large number <b>of</b> scan <b>converter</b> <b>users</b> by developing a Web site. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The test <b>of</b> Sigma-Delta Analogue-to-Digital <b>Converters</b> (?? ADCs) is a {{difficult}} task due to the high resolution and {{the large number of}} samples required. By integrating an additional test circuitry in the chip and by taking advantage of the resources already existing in a ?? ADC, it is possible to perform a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique to make the converter auto-testable. In this paper we present an approach for both the on-chip test signal generation and the on-chip output response analysis. The method, mostly digital, is based on the application of a binary stream which encodes a sinusoidal signal. This stimulus is chosen to have a very high quality in the bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>converter</b> with the quantization error laying out of the analogue modulator bandwidth. In order to analyse the output response, we need a very precise sinusoidal signal. This reference signal can be also obtained from the same input stimulus, by passing it directly to the digital filter existing in the converter. Simulations results show the capability of this technique to obtain measures of the SNDR (Signal-to-Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio) for a 16 -bit audio ?? ADC...|$|R
