60|$|Ginger {{gave it a}} shove, {{but it was no}} good. There {{was three}} or four people coming along the road, and Sam made up 'is mind in an instant, and <b>'eld</b> <b>up</b> his 'and to a cab that was passing.|$|R

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head <b>held</b> <b>up</b> and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals <b>held</b> <b>up</b> altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E

5|$|Before The 3rd Birthdays {{release in}} 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura {{discussed}} the re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II. The release was being <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{partly due to}} the series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena.|$|E
5|$|But the Admiral {{was never}} {{assigned}} another command. Concluding {{that he was}} being <b>held</b> <b>up</b> as a scapegoat, and feeling bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at the moment of the Navy's greatest accomplishment, Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945, and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946.|$|E
5|$|Each {{dining table}} had benches which <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to six men, {{although}} smaller {{tables and chairs}} later replaced these which seated four. All of the prison population, including the guards and officials would dine together, thus seating over 250 people. The food served at Alcatraz was reportedly {{the best in the}} United States prison system.|$|E

5|$|<b>Held</b> <b>up</b> by {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, LI Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through a hastily established defensive line between Pregrada and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted {{troops of the}} 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure Ustaše-controlled Varaždin. The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|Polistes nests can be {{built from}} wood fiber which are {{collected}} from posts and plant stems. The fiber is formed into a paper like comb with hexagonal cells. The nests are orientated downward and are <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by one filament. P. exclamans have also been observed occupying artificial nests put out by researchers and consisting of bundles of straws.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Brigade {{continued}} their advance without interruption to Jinsafut, which was occupied in the evening. The 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers (7th Brigade) {{were ordered to}} pass through the 8th Brigade and capture the road junction northeast of El Funduq. Here they captured an artillery column of five field guns, horses, wagons and prisoners which had been <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by fire from the 9th Brigade.|$|E

The 22nd Mounted Brigade was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by Ottoman units defending Aqir while the 6th Mounted Brigade (with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade protecting their northern flank) was directed against el Mughar.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{along the}} coastal road—which lacked tank support—was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> all morning by {{determined}} Italian resistance {{at the bottom}} of Halfaya Pass. This objective was finally achieved toward evening when SCompany 2nd Rifle Brigade—supported by Australian anti-tank gunners fighting as infantry—overran the Italian positions taking around 130 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Franco–Belgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had {{withdrawn}} laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the French 2nd Army units moving north toward Namur and Huy. Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, {{considered to be an}} elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{now sits}} amongst a unique urban skyline {{and is the}} oldest Division I FBS {{football}} stadium. In fact, the only Division I stadiums older are Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Stadium. Grant Field was natural grass until 1971. The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995. The stadium officially holds 55,000 but has <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to 56,412 in 2005 and 56,680 in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The understrength Turkish {{battalion}} {{entrusted with}} its defence doggedly held out with great courage {{and in so}} doing fulfilled its obligation. They <b>held</b> <b>up</b> two English cavalry divisions for six hours and had prevented them from expanding their outflanking manoeuvres around the Beersheba-Hebron road.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
