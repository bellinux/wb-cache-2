40|$|This {{document}} is {{a guide to}} explosives firing using exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators. It details the special equipment and procedures developed in the Weapons Systems Division, Maribyrnong and currently in use in the Division's firing chambers and at field test sites, and discusses {{the relative merits of}} <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> and EBW detonators. It serves as a useful guide and reference document to both Firing Officer trainers and trainees...|$|R
50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, {{but it is}} small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full, high voltage high current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b>|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} an electromagnetic (EM) fire warning alarm sys-tem for underground mines. The system generates a magnetic field for through-the-earth signal trans-mission to microreceivers carried by individual miners. EM fields can induce electric currents in metallic conductors; if an EM transmitting antenna and an electric blasting cap array are too close, the field could induce a current in the blasting array and cause an unintentional initiation of the <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b> The USBM conducted tests that define the safe and unsafe regions for using <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> near the transmitting antenna of the warning alarm system. The minimum safe distance between a transmitting antenna and a blasting array is the distance where the induced electrical current in the blasting array is 50 mA, which is the safe current level specified in Federal mine safety regulations. Tests indicate that at transmitting power levels of 100 -and 1, 000 -W, separation distances of 9 and 21 m, respectively, were required. These distances are small compared with the dimensions of a mine. Thus, the tests indicate that, with proper placement of the transmitting antenna, the warning system can be used safely in the proximity of blasting arrays...|$|R

5000|$|A non <b>electric</b> <b>{{detonator}}</b> is a {{shock tube}} detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally {{for the purpose}} of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) {{along the length of the}} tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of Non electric detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications. Non electric detonators was invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of Per-Anders Persson, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973. (Nitro Nobel became a part of Dyno Nobel after being sold to Norwegian Dyno Industrier AS in 1986.) Nonel is a contraction of [...] "Non electric detonators".|$|E
50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A <b>electric</b> <b>detonator</b> initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern.|$|E

Damage deformation degree decreases with increased shell strength, reduced shell and internal charging mass summation and reduced impact velocity square. The model calculated value agrees well with the test data. The deformation model can be used to predict overload damage deformation for such detonator...|$|E
