40|$|We study {{adaptive}} learning {{behavior in a}} sequence of n-period endowment overlapping generations economies with fiat currency, where n refers {{to the number of}} periods in agents' lifetimes. Agents initially have heterogeneous beliefs and seek to form multi-step-ahead forecasts of future prices using a <b>forecast</b> <b>rule</b> chosen from a vast set of possible <b>forecast</b> <b>rules.</b> Agents take optimal actions given their forecasts of future prices. They learn in every period by creating new <b>forecast</b> <b>rules</b> and by emulating the <b>forecast</b> <b>rules</b> of other agents. Computational experiments with artificial adaptive agents are conducted. These experiments yield three qualitatively different types of outcomes. In one, the initially heterogeneous population of artificial agents learns to coordinate on a low inflation, stationary perfect foresight equilibrium. In another, we observe persistent currency collapse. The third outcome is a lack of coordination within the allotted time frame. One possible outcome, a stationary perfect foresight equilibrium with a relatively high inflation rate, is never observed. Consumption (Economics) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper models {{expectation}} formation {{by taking}} into account that agents produce heterogeneous expectations due to model uncertainty, informational frictions and different capacities for processing information. We show that there are two general classes of steady states within this framework: those where strictly dominated <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> vanish, and intrinsic heterogeneous steady states where a positive proportion of agents use a more costly perfect foresight. This demonstrates that intrinsic heterogeneity can also arise in a model where the <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> are not equally costly, and do not exhibit identical performance in the long run. ...|$|R

40|$|This survey reviews {{a dynamic}} multi-asset {{framework}} in which heterogeneous agents with multi-period planning horizons interact. This framework distinguishes between temporary equilibrium maps describing the basic market mechanism of an asset market, <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> which model {{the way in which}} expectations are formed, and a model for exogenous random perturbations. Perfect <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> which provide correct forecasts for first and second moments of future prices are introduced. Based on these perfect <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules,</b> fundamental concepts of the traditional CAPM are extended to a setting in which beliefs are not homogeneous. We review a multi-fund separation theorem and introduce the notion of a generational portfolio which is held by investors with homogeneous beliefs and identical planning horizons. It is shown that social interaction among consumers may endogenously create risk leading to non-ergodic behavior of asset prices. The stochastic dynamics of asset prices, beliefs, portfolio holdings, and market shares are illustrated with numerical simulations. ∗ Acknowledgment.

40|$|Since the {{floating}} of the Australian dollar the forecasting of exchange rate movements {{has become more}} difficult and received much more attention. As a result, some participants in the foreign exchange market have, {{on a number of}} occasions, come under criticism for their inability to predict exchange rate movements. This article seeks to evaluate these criticisms through an examination of exchange rate forecasts made by market participants (as published in the Australian Financial Review from March 1985 to December 1985). The accuracy of the $A/US$ forecasts is compared with that of forecasts generated from a number of simple <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> as well as forecasts of the US$/Yen exchange rate. In general, the simple <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules</b> provide superior <b>forecasts</b> to those provided by the individual market participants. However, under some criteria, the mean of the individual participants' forecasts may be preferred to these simple <b>forecasting</b> <b>rules.</b> Further, the comparison of the US$/Yen forecasts with the $A/US$ forecasts shows the former to be generally more accurate.

Depending on the value of a preference parameter, the limiting backward(direction of time reversed) perfect-foresight dynamics are characterized bysteady-state, periodic, or chaotic trajectories for real money balances. We relax the perfect-foresight assumption and examine how a population ofartificial, heterogeneous adaptive agents might learn in such anenvironment. These artificial agents optimize given their forecasts offuture prices, and they use <b>forecast</b> <b>rules</b> that are consistent with steady-state or periodic trajectories for prices. The agents <b>forecast</b> <b>rules</b> areupdated by a genetic algorithm.

40|$|Farmer (Review of Economic Studies, 58, 321 - 32, 1991) {{suggests}} that in a model {{in which there are}} multiple rational expectations equilibria agents may find it useful to coordinate their expectations in a unique rational expectations equilibrium which is supported by a self-fulfilling <b>forecast</b> <b>rule</b> having the property of being immune to the Lucas Critique. In this paper, Farmer's hypothesis is tested using data from hyperinflationary episodes. It is believed that those episodes are suitable for testing this hypothesis because an agent who lives in a hyperinflationary environment usually faces frequent changes in policy regime. The agent may thus choose a selffulfilling <b>forecast</b> <b>rule</b> which is immune to the Lucas Critique as a way of hedging against unanticipated policy regime switches. The empirical results show mixed evidence on Farmer's hypothesis during the hyperinflationary episodes studied. ...|$|R

40|$|Rational {{expectations}} models fail {{to explain}} the disconnect between the exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals. In line with survey evidence on the behaviour of foreign exchange traders, we introduce model misspecification and learning into a standard monetary model.

40|$|Defence date: 8 June 2009 Examining Board: Marco Celentani, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid Olivier Gossner, Paris-Jourdan Sciences Economiques Karl Schlag, Supervisor, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Fernando Vega-Redondo, European University InstituteThe {{first chapter}} {{examines}} {{the performance of}} a simple <b>forecasting</b> <b>rule</b> within a complex environment and evaluates the cost of operating with a model that only partially embraces the complexity of the faced serially correlated process. The intuition behind the simple <b>forecasting</b> <b>rule</b> examined is the following: when knowingly facing a serially correlated environment, I may simply forecast at every period the most frequent follower of the outcome observed in the preceding period. Thus, when predicting tomorrow’s weather, I may simply predict the most frequent follower of today’s outcome, whether rain or sun. In the case that we study, the process driving observed outcomes however renders such a strategy imperfect. This strategy, indeed, would be optimal only {{in the case of a}} first order Markovian process. In contrast, against the process that we study, a forecaster would always benefit from conditioning his choice on longer sequences of events. Instead of asking, "What usually happens after a rainy day?", he would benefit from asking what happens after more complex chains of events such as for example: "What happens after 2 rainy days or after a sequence of 5 rainy days followed by 2 sunny days?". Comparing the performance of our minimalist <b>forecasting</b> <b>rule</b> to that of the best possible forecaster, we demonstrate that in the particular case of a simple hidden Markovian environment, the highest possible foregone revenue from operating with a poor model is quite limited. Chapter 2 and 3 address the issue of learning within a social environment. The crucial characteristic of learning within social environments is that the available information reduces to what other agents are willing or able to reveal. One may think of information as a. uid that permeates systems of agents. In this light, the issue then becomes to understand the mechanics of this fluid: how does it flow between agents, what are the forces impeding its full diffusion within the system? And if diffusion is only local or partial, what are reasonable models of such partial diffusion processes and equilibrium diffusion patterns?
