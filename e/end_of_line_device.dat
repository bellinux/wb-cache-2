40|$|With {{semiconductor}} industry's aggressive march towards 45 nm CMOS {{technology and}} {{introduction of new}} materials and device structures in sight for 32 nm and 22 nm nodes, it is crucial for the IC design and CAD community to understand the challenges posed by these potential technology changes. This tutorial will focus on these challenges starting from front <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> (<b>devices)</b> to the back <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> (interconnects) and finally the impact on CAD. We will discuss the impact of various device technology options/improvements, such as high-κ, metal gate, low temperature operation, increased mobility and reduced variability, on the overall chip performance {{in the context of}} power-constrained technology optimization. This will show that power constraints limit, but do not eliminate, the performance improvements available from new technology. The integration issues related to lowκ materials for interconnects in 45 nm and beyond will be examined in the context of advanced IC design. Ultra low-κ materials, evolution of etch and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), and techniques to limit damage during processing and their impact on design performance will be discussed in detail. These advanced device and interconnect structures and materials including 3 D technology have tremendous impact on the direction of the CAD industry. We will discuss the design methodology and CAD implications of these imminent technology changes...|$|R

40|$|Ika Rusdiati, 2012, The Analysis of Word Split at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Line</b> on “The Jakarta Post” Editorial, Thesis, English Department, Tarbiyah Faculty, Advisors: (1) Dr. Saifuddin Ahmad Husin, M. A (2) Hj. Noor Maulidiyah, M. A This study {{identified}} the word split at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> on national column on “The Jakarta Pos” editorial. The {{purposes of this}} research are; to identify the way the Jakarta Post editorial splits the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line,</b> to find the approach that the Jakarta Post applies in splitting the words and to find the words split in national column on The Jakarta Post editorial based on its approach and frequency, so {{this can be a}} sharing forum in improving the quality of English language in the future. To collect the data, the writer used one method: library-based research and two techniques: reading and online. The data were processed through editing, coding, classification, and interpretation of data. Then, all data were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. It can be concluded that actually the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> on national column on The Jakarta Post are split in a proper way. It uses hyphen (-) in splitting the words and applies a proper approach, but the writer found there are some words including proper names are split at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> not based on either (phonetic and morphological) and it is better not to divide a proper name at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line.</b> The Jakarta Post editorial applies two approaches in splitting the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line,</b> they are phonetic and morphological. Phonetic is dividing the word in term of syllable structure while morphological is dividing the word in term of word structure. In this research the writer takes 20 editions of The Jakarta Post editorial and find there are 1. 031 words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split in phonetic approach, 429 words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split in morphological approach and 428 words including proper names at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split not based on either...|$|R
