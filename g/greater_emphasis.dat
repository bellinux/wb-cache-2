5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976. In 1978 the National Council decided in a half-step backwards that Wood Badge needed to place <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the practical aspects of good troop operation {{along with a}} variety of leadership exercises. Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E
5|$|Budget and {{management}} {{reforms in the}} 1980s and 1990s saw a change in budgeting, including a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on outcomes, and decreasing emphasis on inputs. This has been reflected {{in the activities of}} Senate committees, with Senators' questions being increasingly focussed on the 'results of government activities and away from a concern with inputs'.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{rejected}} the colonial Western format of education system. He {{stated that it}} led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E
5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> {{was placed}} on the {{accuracy}} of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by William Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person {{view and}} {{gameplay}} places a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects {{such as the}} gradual disappearance of Mary's letter {{were added to the}} game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed to reflect James' subconscious. References to history, films and literature can also be found in the game.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity {{the first priority}} in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E

The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.|$|E

5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E

5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Government {{released}} a new Defence White Paper, Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force that placed a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed {{to improve the}} ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year; in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the Defence Updates emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.|$|E

5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
