The Camelina species, {{commonly known as}} <b>false</b> <b>flax,</b> are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia.

Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus Camelina in his classification works in 1762. As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from camelina seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel. The study said substantial government intervention would be one way to create a market for camelina, by combining 9 percent government subsidy on camelina crop production, with 9 percent tax on the conventional fuel.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{range of}} fuels that a diesel engine may be {{expected}} to burn is increasing including the use of biodiesels and alcohols produced from various plant or animal sources. Moreover, fuels can become unsuitable for application in diesel engines due to a variety of contamination, degradation, and cold flow issues. In order to optimize engine performance and meet EPA emissions standards over a wide array of fuels, information about the fuel composition must be known in real time. Furthermore, protecting the engine from potential fuel contaminants such as water, sulfur, glycerol, methanol, and urea requires a method of detecting these chemicals in the fuel system. This study evaluates a commercially available fluid properties sensor for use in diesel engines. The sensor provides four bulk outputs: temperature, density, dynamic viscosity, and dielectric constant, which can be used to monitor fuel properties. Extensive testing was carried out on the sensor to evaluate its effectiveness at detecting fuel type, blend, and quality over a temperature range of 0 °- 80 °C. Fuel types tested include diesel # 1, diesel # 2, jet A, soy biodiesel, rapeseed biodiesel, <b>false</b> <b>flax</b> biodiesel, jatropha biodiesel, soy oil, rapeseed oil, <b>false</b> <b>flax</b> oil, and jatropha oil. Blends of diesel # 1 and # 2 with soy biodiesel were studied. Fuel properties under contamination and the sensor’s sensitivity to fuel degradation and cold flow situations were examined. A predictive model of fuel properties was developed based on fuel composition, contamination, and temperature range. Finally, an algorithm was developed to predict fuel type, blend, contamination condition, and degradation condition for unknown fuel samples...|$|E

Six categories of risk probability have been developed from ‘no effect’ to ‘substantial and widespread effect. ’ Accordingly, conditions of field releases are defined to the risk category term of monitoring and level of containment of GM species belonging to these categories. In the case of Ukraine, such preliminary risk assessment was done for oilseed rape, sugar beet, potato, corn, and <b>false</b> <b>flax.</b> The proposed technique can be used in the risk assessment of plant introduction.

Therefore in an organic feeding trial with a total of 192 broilers the effects of different amounts of Camelina oil cake (0 %, 2. 5 %, 5 % and 5 % heat and pressure treated) in the diet concerning performance, carcass and meat quality were tested. The substitution of Camelina oil cake against soy cake till 5 % caused inconsistent results concerning performance. Treated oil cake significantly caused poor performance and enlarged thyroid glands and livers. Carcass, meat, and fat quality remained unaffected. But anyway, a recommendation concerning the rea-sonable amount of Camelina oil cake in a broiler diet based on this single trial seems not feasible. Therefore further research has to be done...|$|E
40|$|A study {{into the}} {{sanitary}} state of roots and culm base of winter wheat {{was carried out}} in 1999 - 2002 in the Production and Experimental Station in Bałcyny near Ostróda. Experimental wheat was cultivated after spring cross plants such as spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleiferus Metz.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L), chinese mustard (Brassica juncea L.), oleiferous radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiferus L.), <b>false</b> <b>flax</b> (Camelina sativa L.), crambe (Crambe abbysinica Hoechst.) and after oats (Avena sativa L.) as a control. The other experimental factor was the method of after-harvest residue management, i. e. ploughing in the stubble, ploughing in the stubble and straw, ploughing in the stubble and straw with nitrogen added. The occurrence of root rot and stem base diseases was affected by weather conditions and forecrop species. Winter wheat roots were attacked to the lowest degree when spring rape and radish were used as forecrops, and to the highest degree - when grown after oat. The culm base was most intensely infected with fusarium foot rot (Fusarium spp.). The remaining root-rot diseases occurred every year but with different intensity. The method of utilization of after-harvest residues did not have a clear effect on the intensity of infection of the roots and culm base of winter wheat...|$|E
