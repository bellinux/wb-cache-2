5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference <b>fringes.</b> The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference <b>fringes</b> at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved <b>fringes.</b> Each pair of adjacent <b>fringes</b> represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the <b>fringes.</b> The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the <b>fringes</b> are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the <b>fringes</b> in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the <b>fringes</b> as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern <b>fringes</b> of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern <b>fringes</b> of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western <b>fringes</b> form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} <b>fringes</b> {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of <b>fringes.</b> Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

40|$|Filtering off {{noise from}} <b>fringe</b> {{patterns}} {{is important for}} processing and analysis of interferometric <b>fringe</b> patterns.

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference <b>fringes.</b> Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the <b>fringes,</b> so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel <b>fringes</b> rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the <b>fringes</b> to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing.

Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric <b>fringes,</b> which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
