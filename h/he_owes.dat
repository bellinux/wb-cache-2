5|$|The Internal Revenue Service filed a tax lien against Pacino, {{claiming}} <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> {{the government}} {{a total of}} $188,000 for 2008 and 2009. A representative for Pacino blamed his former business manager Kenneth Starr for the discrepancy.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with Shirley Benson (Robyn Moore), telling her that his wife, Pushpa, is dead. He takes her to a wedding as his guest, but Pushpa arrives, introducing herself and exposing Dan's lie. Shirley then breaks up with him. The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as he knows his father will be furious if he discovers them together. Ash reveals to Shirley that he is a compulsive gambler and he lost his house and ruined his marriage in the process; Dan had bailed him out. He says <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> his father everything and he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|The trio are {{captured}} by Snatchers {{and taken to}} Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione to learn how the three acquired the sword, which she had believed was in her vault at Gringotts. With the help of Dobby the house-elf they escape along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. Peter Pettigrew emerges and begins to strangle Harry, but Harry reminds him that <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> him a life debt. When Pettigrew hesitates, his brief moment of mercy causes his silver hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it. During the escape Harry steals Draco Malfoy's wand and Dobby dies. Bellatrix' terror in interrogating Hermione suggests to Harry some exceptional object is in her vault, and when questioned, Griphook confirms a gold cup is indeed in her vault. With Griphook's help, they break into the vault at Gringotts, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, but in the chaos they lose the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry has a vision of Voldemort and sees he now understands their plan, and intends to make his remaining horcruxes even safer. The vision also confirms the unidentified horcrux is at Hogwarts.|$|E
60|$|He had an {{extraordinary}} persuasion {{that in some}} obscure way he was in default, {{that he was to}} blame for her distress, that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> her--he could never define what <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|He {{is full of}} {{his idea}} of dignity. It is right for every man to {{preserve}} his dignity. There is a dignity of station, which a man has in trust to preserve; there is a dignity of personal character, which every man by being made man is bound to preserve. But you see Mr. Hastings's idea of dignity has no connection with integrity; it has no connection with honest fame; it has no connection with the reputation which he is bound to preserve. What, my Lords, did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the Company that had appointed him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the legislature,--did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to your Lordships, and to the House of Commons, who had appointed him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to himself? to the country that bore him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the world, as to its opinion, to which every public man owes a reputation? What an example was here held out to the Company's servants! ...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the debtor offers a lesser sum in {{settlement}} and expressly or by implication admits that <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> the full debt, he commits {{an act of}} insolvency, because he tacitly acknowledges that he cannot pay the debt (Laeveldse Kooperasie Bpk v Joubert).|$|E

25|$|Sohail {{was born}} and raised in Sakhakot Malakand Division in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He played tennis-ball cricket from a young age and bowled at a lively pace, {{something}} he says <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> to the muscle strength he built up from throwing stones and swimming in rivers and streams present in the mountainous environment. Realising his potential and on the advice of a friend, he moved to Karachi to play professional cricket.|$|E

25|$|There {{is nothing}} to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> a debt, and whom {{he is unable to}} pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a letter saying that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of homelessness, Frost meets and {{falls in love with}} a young man named Troy, who agrees to let her live with him. She learns that <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> a large amount of money to a local mobster named Lucien. In order to save Troy's life, Frost agrees to {{participate}} in a fake kidnapping scheme in an attempt to extort the remainder of Troy's debt from her father. However, this soon turns into a real kidnapping and Troy is killed while valiantly attempting to save Frost from an enraged Lucien. Using her powers, Frost turns the thugs against one another and then forces the remaining henchman to free her.|$|E
25|$|Though Moshe ha-Darshan was {{considered}} a rabbinical authority, <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> his reputation principally {{to the fact that}} together with Tobiah ben Eliezer he was the most prominent representative of midrashic-symbolic Bible exegesis (derash) in the 11th century. His work on the Bible, probably sometimes called Yesod, and known only by quotations found mostly in Rashi's commentaries (Rashi quotes him 19 times in his pirush Al HaTorah, and only twice in his pirush on Shas - once in Kesuvos 75b, and the other in Niddah 19a), contained extracts from earlier haggadic works as well as midrashic explanations of his own. Often the latter were not in harmony with the spirit of the rabbinical Midrash and even contained Christian theological conceptions.|$|E
60|$|That, the Company having sent express {{orders for}} the sending the Resident by them before {{appointed}} to Benares, the said Warren Hastings did strongly oppose himself to the same, and did throw upon the person appointed by the Company (Francis Fowke, Esquire) several strong, but unspecified, reflections and aspersions, contrary to the duty <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> to the Company, and to the justice <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> to all its servants.|$|R

25|$|At {{roughly the}} same time, Kierkegaard was {{discovered}} by several proponents of the Jewish-Christian philosophy of dialogue in Germany, namely by Martin Buber, Ferdinand Ebner, and Franz Rosenzweig. In addition to the philosophy of dialogue, existential philosophy has its point of origin in Kierkegaard and his concept of individuality. Martin Heidegger sparsely refers to Kierkegaard in Being and Time (1927), obscuring how much <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> to him. Walter Kaufmann discussed Sartre, Jaspers, and Heidegger in relation to Kierkegaard, and Kierkegaard {{in relation to the}} crisis of religion in the 1960s. Later, Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling (Series Two) and The Sickness Unto Death (Series Three) were included in the Penguin Great Ideas Series (Two and Three).|$|E
25|$|Bavarian law was {{committed}} to writing between the years 739 AD and 748 AD. Supplementary clauses, added afterwards, bear evidence of Frankish influence. Thus, while the duchy belongs to the Agilolfing family, the duke must be chosen by the people and his election confirmed by the Frankish king, to whom <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> fealty. The duke has a fivefold weregild, summons the nobles and clergy for purposes of deliberation, calls out the host, administers justice and regulates finance. Five noble families exist, possibly representing former divisions of the people. Subordinate to the nobles we find the freeborn and then the freedmen. The law divided the country into gaits or counties, under their counts, assisted by judges responsible for declaring the law.|$|E
25|$|Neal {{wakes up}} in the same place where Aurora woke from her {{sleeping}} curse, being tended to by her, Prince Phillip, and Mulan. When Neal reveals that he knows Emma, Aurora tries to communicate with Henry through the Netherworld via the sleeping curse. When she is unsuccessful, Neal and Mulan set out for Rumpelstiltskin's castle, hoping to find something to lead them to Emma and Henry. When they arrive there, they meet Robin Hood, who has taken up residence in the castle, but allows them to search for what they seek to repay the life debt <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> Rumpelstiltskin. Finding his father's old staff, Neal manages to uncover a concealed cabinet full of magical objects, including a crystal ball that tells him that Emma is in Neverland.|$|E
50|$|Lalín himself also {{declared}} {{personal bankruptcy}} in 1998 following {{a request by}} former Racing coach Carlos Babington, to whom <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> $600,000. They had worked out a payment deal but Lalín had reneged on it. Critics claimed that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> $8 million and accused him of fraudulent management. It was noted that he actually had “nothing to his name” and held all his assets through companies. “Fiscally he doesn’t exist,” an attorney stated.|$|R

25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Dan Evans (Bale) is {{an impoverished}} rancher and Civil War veteran. <b>He</b> <b>owes</b> money to Glen Hollander (Loftin) {{and when he}} fails to pay, two of Hollander's men set fire to his barn. The next morning, as Evans and his two sons look for their herd, they stumble upon outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his gang, who have taken {{advantage}} of Evans' cattle in order to block the road and ambush an armored stagecoach staffed by Pinkerton agents. As Wade's outfit loots the upended stage, Wade discovers Evans and his two sons watching from the hills. Determining that they pose no threat to him and his gang, Wade takes their horses and tells Evans that he will leave them tied up on the road to Bisbee. Wade's gang departs, and Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Byron McElroy (Fonda), left alive but severely wounded by Wade.|$|E
25|$|His {{satisfactory}} record {{may also}} have been {{due to the fact that}} he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days—in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of Augustus, since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.|$|E

In the following month, the Prior of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> John {{the sum of}} £800. John also lent money to the King, such as an unstated sum that in June 1329 was outstanding but secured on the customs revenue of Southampton.|$|R
