50|$|In the APG III {{classification}} system, it {{is placed}} in the family Colchicaceae. The genus previously included five species in North America, but these have been separated as the genus Prosartes D.Don and moved to the family Liliaceae in accordance to differences in <b>karyology</b> and chemistry as well as results from molecular systematic investigations.

50|$|Distinguishing close species {{within a}} complex {{requires}} {{the study of}} often very small differences. Morphological differences may be minute and only visible using adapted methods, such as microscopy. However, distinct species may sometimes have no morphological differences. In these cases, other characters, e.g. in the species' life history, behavior, physiology, or <b>karyology</b> can be explored. As an example, territorial songs are indicative of species in the treecreepers, a bird genus with little morphological differences. Mating tests are common in some groups such as fungi to confirm the reproductive isolation of two species.|$|E

Her contributions to Macaronesian flora werepublished mostly in the Bulletin of the Broterian Society and Broterian Iconographia Selecta Azoricae Florae. Noteworthy studies published between 1993 and 1997, were the Flora Ibérica (Vols. III, IV and V), which include taxonomic treatments of eight genera belonging to the Cruciferae, Crassulaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Malvaceae [...] She contributed to Flora Europaea, particularly noteworthy papers published in Volumes II (1968), III (1972) and IV (1976), covering the systematic study of 11 genera belonging to the Boraginaceae, Compositae, Labiatae, Malvaceae and Scrophulariaceae.

50|$|She {{enrolled}} at the Escola Secundária Maria Amália Vaz de Carvalho in 1928 and graduated in 1941 in Biological Sciences from the University of Lisbon. In June of the same year, attending a Congress of Natural Sciences in Lisbon, she met Abilio Fernandes, who was soon to be her husband. They settled in Coimbra, after Abilio moved there in August 1941 {{to take up the}} position ofMuseum Director at the University of Coimbra. In November 1947 he was appointed Naturalist of that institution, and remained there {{for the rest of his}} career. Rosette proceeded to reorganise and update the classification of herbarium material and published an index of seeds of the Botanical Garden. She went on numerous botanical collecting trips in Portugal, and arranged expeditions to Mozambique with her husband where they made large collections of plants, greatly increasing the herbarium material of the Botanical Institute of Coimbra and the Center for Tropical Research.Between 1944 and 1991, she attended 41 international congresses, held in Spain, France, UK, Sweden and Portugal, while between 1945 and2000, she published some 250 papers, mainly in the field of plant systematics, but also in <b>karyology,</b> ethnobotany and the history of botany. From her considerable work in plant taxonomy, and numerous new combinations, she described more than fifty taxa new to science.|$|E
