The similarities and the major differences of these two regulative approaches are emphasized. The major similarities between EMIR and the Dodd-Frank Act relate to the mandatory clearing for standardized contracts, the scope of the derivatives covered, the exemptions from clearing for end-users and the reporting of cleared and uncleared derivative transactions by nearly all <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties.</b> The major differences arise with the restrictions on bank proprietary trading, with separation of derivative trading activities from commercial banking activities, with central counterparties (CCP) ownership rules and with the establishment of mandatory exchange trading requirement. ...|$|R

40|$|Enhanced BIS {{statistics}} on credit risk transfer 1 From June 2011, the BIS credit derivatives statistics provide more granular {{information on the}} types of risks transferred through credit default swaps by different groups of counterparties. The new data suggest that reporting dealers have used some hard-tovalue credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to shadow banks, possibly exposing these counterparty groups to valuation risks. The data also show that some <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties</b> have sold protection against defaults in the same sector on a net basis. JEL classification: C 82, G 18. The BIS CDS statistics were enhanced in two phases First, a finer breakdown of <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties</b> was introduced Second, the types of risks exchanged with counterparties were decomposed Opacity about the location of exposures to failing financial institutions exacerbated the recent financial crisis. In particular, there was a shortage {{of information about the}} web of credit risk transfers through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. To reduce that data gap, the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) proposed two sets of enhancements to the semiannual credit default swaps (CDS) statistics compiled by the BIS (CGFS (2009)). These have been implemented in two phases. The first set of enhancements, introduced with the June 2010 statistics, provides a finer classification of the counterparties of reporting derivatives dealers (Vause (2010)). The new data showed net credit risk transfers from hedge funds to reporting dealers and from reporting dealers to all other sectors. 2 This pattern persisted in December 2010 and June 2011 (Graph 1). The second set of enhancements, first applied to the June 2011 data, makes two further improvements. It decomposes total credit risk transfers with each counterparty group according to characteristics of the underlying debt (sector, rating and maturity). It also reveals the market values of credit risk transfers with counterparties in different sectors after netting of any bilateral CDS positions with offsetting market values. This identifies counterparty groups 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.

40|$|In {{order to}} place this Report’s “Recommendations ” and “Guiding Principles ” in perspective, {{this section of}} the Report will begin with an {{overview}} of the causes, triggers and dynamics of contemporary financial shocks which have the potential to take on systemic characteristics. As a starting point, a distinction must be drawn between financial disturbances and systemic or potentially systemic financial shocks. Financial disturbances arise with some frequency and can have their origins in a number of factors ranging from a geopolitical event such as September 11 to a failure of a specific financial or nonfinancial corporation. However, financial disturbances do not exhibit the very rapid contagion effects present in financial shocks as discussed below. The absence of rapid and far reaching contagion effects may be due to any number of factors including: (1) the event was widely discounted in the first place, (2) public or private policy responses are swift and decisive, and/or (3) the event does not raise broad-based concerns about potential or actual credit losses that could compromise the ability of <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties</b> to perform {{in a manner consistent with}} their obligations.

40|$|The Relationship of Unregulated OTC Derivatives to the Meltdown. It is now {{accepted}} {{wisdom that}} it was the non-transparent, poorly capitalized, and almost wholly unregulated over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives market that lit the fuse that exploded the highly vulnerable worldwide economy in the fall of 2008. Because tens of trillions of dollars of these financial products were pegged to the economic performance of an overheated and highly inflated housing market, the sudden collapse of that market triggered under-capitalized or non-capitalized OTC derivative guarantees of the subprime housing investments. Moreover, the many undercapitalized insurers of that collapsing market had other multi-trillion dollar OTC derivatives obligations with thousands of <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties</b> (through unregulated interest rate, currency, foreign exchange, and energy derivatives). If a financial institution failed because it could not pay off some of these obligations, trillions of dollars of interconnected transactions would have also failed, causing a cascade of collapsing banks throughout the world. It was this potential of systemic failure that required the United States taxpayer to plug the huge capital hole that a daisy chain of nonpayments by the world’s largest financial institutions would have caused, thereby heading off the cratering of the world’s economy...|$|R

40|$|My {{interest}} in this research topic {{was inspired by the}} apparently global consensus on the mandate for central clearing in the credit default swaps market. At the first glance, the central clearing mechanism with its central counterparties is the hero who saved many market participants from substantial losses following Lehman Brother’s collapse. It was heralded for debunking the complex interconnection among <b>financial</b> <b>counterparties</b> and resolving Lehman Brother’s positions in a timely and orderly manner. Nonetheless, after coming into the spotlight, central counterparties raise significant concern about their potential to concentrate systemic risk and grown into ‘too important to fail’ institutions. Any collapse of a ‘too important to fail’ institution is undoubtedly disastrous and likely results in a cascade of defaults by other market participants. Therefore, it is highly questionable whether central clearing can ultimately maintain and protect the market robustness and sustainability. It is even criticised as the Maginot Line of the financial market for being a costly but inefficient bulwark and creating a “false sense of security”. Therefore, this research paper aims to address the aforementioned concern, whether the central clearing regime should be promoted to mitigate the counterparty risk even when it simultaneously propagates another type of systemic risk to the financial market. As the legal framework and the risk management practices of CCP have not been battle test, it is impossible to reach any final and ex post conclusion on the ultimate efficiency of CCP. Nevertheless, historically CCP managed to withstand severe market distress whereas currently policymakers and regulators are spending increasing efforts on addressing and mitigating the systemic risk concentrated through CCP. Compared to other alternative clearing infrastructures, it is evident that central clearing is the optimal approach to address the counterparty risk and to enhance the market stability. Further, the research demonstrates that despite central counterparties’ potential to concentrate and re-distribute systemic risk, their shortcomings and contagious fallouts are not insurmountable. They can be efficiently controlled and mitigated through the implementation of adequate regulations and supervision...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} against the potential losses {{in case of a}} participant's default and to contain systemic risk, central counterparties (CCPs) need to maintain sufficient financial resources. Typically, these financial resources consist of margin requirements and contributions to a collective default fund. Based on a stylized model of CCP risk management, this article analyzes the main factors affecting the trade-off between margins and default fund. The optimal balance between these two risk management instruments is found to depend on collateral costs, participants' default probability, {{and the extent to which}} margin requirements are associated with risk-mitigating incentives.

The turmoil made risk managers and regulators more vigilant in scrutinising their risk assessment. The probability of default (PD) is an essential parameter in measuring counterparty credit risk, which in turn has impact on pricing of loans and derivatives. The last decade, a method using Markov chains to estimate rating migrations, migration matrices and PD has evolved to become an industry standard. In this thesis, a holistic approach to implementing this approach in discrete and continuous time is taken. The results show that an implementation in continuous time has many advantages. Also, it is indicated that a bootstrap method is preferred to calculate confidence intervals for the PDs. Moreover, an investigation show that the frequently used assumption of time-homogeneous migration matrices is most probably wrong. By studying expansions and recessions, specific expansion and recession migration matrices are calculated to mitigate the impact of time-inhomogeneity.

40|$|Futures {{exchanges and}} other <b>financial</b> {{intermediaries}} assume <b>counterparty</b> risks and demand in return guarantees that these counterparties will deliver on their promises. It is often argued that to attract volume, financial intermediaries would settle for excessively low contractual guarantees. In Tano Santos and José Scheinkman (2001) we model financial intermediation {{in an environment}} where traders may choose to default, and we examine the characteristics of the equilibrium. In particular, we investigate whether competition implies excessively low standards. We show that in fact, when society punishes default and intermediaries can impose collateral requirements to effectively limit the size of positions, competition leads to a (constrained) optimal amount of contractual guarantees. In Santos and Scheinkman (2001) we assume that exchanges cannot control the size of the positions taken by individuals, but we preclude investors from participating in more than one exchange. This ignores the effect that trading with one financial intermediary may have on the risks faced by other intermediaries. Financial intermediaries typically cannot control the amount of risk that counterparties will take with other intermediaries. In this paper we examine the effect of dropping this exclusivity assumption. We show that the constrained optimum can no longer be implemented as a standard Nash equilibrium with free entry.
