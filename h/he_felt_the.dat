5|$|A {{few years}} later, an {{attorney}} from the International Trade Commission filed an opinion for another case that said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> related patents from Trend Micro were invalid. Fortinet {{made a new}} legal filing and in December 2010, the US Patent and Trademark Office declared the patents as invalid.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{controversy}} about the trophy occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft, {{whom he had}} known personally. Wandrei's rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E
5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} suit the modern sensibility, several changes were introduced. Akhtar changed a number of aspects of the climax as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} ending was outdated for today's audiences. On the other hand, a number of elements from the original were retained in the new film, notably the background score, two songs, some dialogue, and some situations, all of which Akhtar believed were fine in the original, saying that not including them would be a crime.|$|E

5|$|In the postseason, Bill Clark {{was again}} suspended, {{this time by}} coach Everhart for a conduct issue. The day before the CBI game against Princeton, Everhart {{announced}} that Clark would not travel to the game or participate in any practices or team activities until <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> student ready to return. Clark was reinstated two weeks later, and, as before, no details were revealed.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he felt his writing staff {{would have been able to}} work more effectively if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{chooses to}} be kept in the dark {{about the future of the}} series, never knowing any farther ahead than his current working script. For Kill or Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used on {{previous}} works, but removed the frame from the outside edges because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an integral part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E
60|$|Varney spoke thus without hypocrisy, for {{though the}} {{firmness}} of mind which he boasted was hardness and impenetrability, yet <b>he</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> ascendency which <b>he</b> vaunted; while the interest which <b>he</b> actually <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> fortunes of Leicester gave unusual emotion {{to his voice}} and manner.|$|R

5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> plans for the Bagration were sound, he worried {{about the possibility of}} a German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
50|$|Justice Jackson dissented because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> {{basis for}} Chenery I {{was that the}} SEC must do rule-making before it applies this {{principle}} of law. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> change in opinion {{was due to the}} change in a composition of the Court. He also argued that deference to the agency's expertise made no sense where the agency had never seen the particular problem before.|$|R

5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> decision was made {{in part because of}} the show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
