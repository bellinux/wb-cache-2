There they met cosmonauts Pavel Belyayev and Konstantin Feoktistov, {{with whom they}} drank vodka on the Soviet's Tupolev Tu-134. Collins found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> some cosmonauts were doing {{helicopter}} training like their American counterparts, and Belyayev said that he hoped to make a circum-lunar flight soon. The astronauts' wives had accompanied them on the trip, and Collins and his wife Pat were somewhat forced by NASA and their friends to travel to Metz {{where they had been}} married ten years before. There, they found a third wedding ceremony had been arranged for them (ten years previously they had already had civil and religious ceremonies).|$|E
500|$|Reviewers at Famitsu {{commented on}} the {{user-friendliness}} of the game system, with its quick save function and shortcuts, {{and said that the}} game has enough to pull the player in until the end. Neal Chandran at RPGFan said that the Infinity series had become more and more interesting with each game. He called the character designs [...] "excellent" [...] and distinct from those in previous games in the series; he found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the character designs in previous games, which took place in [...] "watery" [...] settings, had brighter and less earthy colors, while Remember 11, which takes place in the mountains, makes more use of earthy colors.|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E

In those years Špansko were a strong second division club and Strupar a neighbourhood hero. From ŠRC Špansko Strupar moved to the Belgian side K.R.C. Genk.|$|R

Vinnie, for the record, was fired for {{unethical}} behavior, not {{because of lack of}} talent. The guy is very talented. He was unethical. He was fired.|$|R
500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the ancient Oedipus complex continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, but he added that [...] "Connor is not the only one [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
500|$|Aston saw Time Team as an {{extension}} of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was [...] "a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall." [...] Commenting on the popularity of Time Team, and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that [...] "My motive was to get {{as many people as possible}} interested in archaeology, because we [...] all enjoy it and think <b>it</b> <b>interesting.</b> <b>That</b> was my personal aim... and on that basis I think it is a success." [...] Time Team encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities, while subscriptions to Current Archaeology magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years. In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a Time Team fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months, while Aston became a supporter of the Council for British Archaeology's Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches. Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of Time Team, describing the public feedback as [...] "embarrassingly encouraging".|$|E

500|$|In a {{different}} video posted to YouTube, Anonymous addresses news organizations covering {{the conflict and}} criticizes media reporting of the incident. In the video, Anonymous criticizes the media specifically for not mentioning objections by the group to certain controversial aspects {{of the history of}} the Church of Scientology, and cited past incidents including the death of Lisa McPherson: [...] "We find <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> you did not mention the other objections in your news reporting. The stifling and punishment of dissent within the totalitarian organization of Scientology. The numerous, alleged human rights violations. Such as the treatment and events that led to the deaths of victims of the cult such as Lisa McPherson." [...] Lisa McPherson was a Scientologist who died in 1995 under controversial circumstances. Initially, the Church of Scientology was held responsible and faced felony charges in her death. The charges were later dropped and a civil suit brought by McPherson's family was settled in 2004. This second video was removed on January 25, 2008, YouTube citing a [...] "terms of use violation". Organizers of the February 10, 2008, Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology told the St. Petersburg Times the event was timed to coincide with the birthday of Lisa McPherson.|$|E

She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the Doctor {{regularly}} experienced {{time out}} of order and was used to a whole different kind of causality. He believed that the Doctor would attempt to cheat and break his own rules to save the universe from collapsing. The time travel used in the episode {{is compatible with the}} theory of time travel. As the episode features many [...] "time-jumps" [...] when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to figure things out before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding a mop, and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez. Wenger later stated that Smith was [...] "one {{of the few people who}} can pull off a fez".|$|E

500|$|Orr {{was also}} {{involved}} in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players' pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players {{to give up a}} seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, {{as far as we can}} understand, have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, McAdams starred {{opposite}} Channing Tatum in {{the romantic}} drama The Vow, {{based on a}} true story. McAdams and Tatum played a newlywed couple who try to rebuild their relationship after a car crash leaves the wife with no recollections of who he is or their marriage. McAdams was drawn to the [...] "roller coaster" [...] faced by her character and found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the story was told [...] "through the guy's eyes". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams" [...] brings [...] "enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot". Joseph Amodio of Newsday felt that McAdams, [...] "exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen", [...] "is the real draw". However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she was [...] "wasted" [...] in the role: [...] "She is such an appealing actress that it's hard not to wish someone could make better use" [...] of her. Mary Pols of Time found the film an example of McAdams [...] "coasting" [...] in [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] movies and asserted that [...] "she's a much more versatile and clever actress" [...] than such projects would suggest. The film, financed for $30 million, was a major commercial success and became her biggest box-office hit in a leading role. It topped the U.S. box office and has grossed over $196 million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Later, Betty Rizzo {{described}} {{the work as}} the [...] "best-known generic satire written {{in the eighteenth century}} by a woman". Martin and Ruthe Battestin stated that Collier was [...] "an author of wit and spirit". Some critics find <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Collier would [...] "yoke" [...] Richardson with those that he [...] "felt especial antipathy" [...] with: Swift and Fielding. Katherine Craik describes the work as [...] "a courageous social satire published at a time when satires were usually written by and for men".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing these wonderful, perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Akingbola has {{received}} a positive response from Holby City viewers regarding his character. In May 2011, he commented: [...] "A {{lot of people have}} never seen a character like Malick on TV before. People of my parents' age tell me they're loving Malick – the older Nigerian guys love how he bosses people around! I’ve also had younger viewers tell me that they're glad they have a character they can relate to." [...] Critical response has also been generally positive. Malick's introductory episode was selected as recommended viewing by the Sunday Mercury. Inside Soap Katy Moon described him as having made a [...] "big impact from day one", with the observation: [...] "His arrogance, combined with his boundless determination {{to do the right thing}} by his patients, means that no one could have missed his arrival on the wards – be it the medics in the show or Holby viewers." [...] Simon of the Daily Mirror quipped that Malick was [...] "just what the doctor ordered" [...] to counterbalance the programme's weaker males. She positively contrasted Malick—alongside Hanssen and Michael—with former [...] "spineless male doctors". Simon later deemed Malick [...] "lovely", and found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> he was gay.|$|E
2500|$|Defense lawyer Sharp {{expressed}} scepticism regarding {{both the}} terrorism and assault charges: [...] "I think <b>it's</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> they make all these allegations about the dirty bombs {{and other items}} she supposedly had, but they haven't charged her with anything relating to terrorism... I would urge people to consider her as innocent unless the government proves otherwise." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for {{literature}} for his [...] "realistic and imaginative writing, combining {{as it does}} sympathetic humor and keen social perception." [...] The selection was heavily criticized, and described as [...] "one of the Academy's biggest mistakes" [...] in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose [...] "limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising", noting that [...] "he international character of the award and the weight attached to it {{raise questions about the}} mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing.... e think <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age". Steinbeck, when asked {{on the day of the}} announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: [...] "Frankly, no." [...] Biographer Jackson Benson notes, [...] "his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value."
