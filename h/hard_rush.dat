60|$|The {{home was}} the dining-room. There the <b>hard</b> <b>rush</b> floor-covering made the ground light, {{reflecting}} light upon the bottom their hearts; in the window-bay was a broad, sunny seat, {{the table was}} so solid one could not jostle it, and the chairs so strong one could knock them over without hurting them.

50|$|The season nearly hit {{a turning}} point in the year, {{changing}} directions for the worse, when Georgia faced quarterback Connor Shaw, defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, and head coach Steve Spurrier's 11-2 South Carolina Gamecocks (fifth-ranked in the country) in Columbia, South Carolina a week later. The Gamecocks took control early and led 21-0 in the first quarter as Shaw scored on 2 TD passes while South Carolina's return man, Ace Sanders, took a punt 70 yards for a score. With Murray only passing for 109 yards and no touchdowns, Georgia never gathered its composure offensively until the game's final drive when running back Ken Malcome ran <b>hard,</b> <b>rushing</b> 5 times for 45 yards. He scored on a 3-yard TD run to make it a 35-7 final score—as the loss would put the Bulldogs behind the eight ball in league play with the SEC Eastern Division.|$|R

The purpose of the paper was to summarize their work with three beta-carboline, harmala alkaloid-containing plants, Passiflora incarnata (passion flower), Peganum harmala (syrian rue), and Banisteriopsis caapi. Specifically, they wished to report on the phenomena and comparative activity when extracts of each of these plants are smoked in conjunction with DMT.

Besides fighting enemies and moving on from one location to next, {{there are also a}} number of side quests for the player to solve. After completing a quest, the player will receive a prize in return. If the player finishes the game, new features will become available to the player, including sound test, <b>hard</b> mode, boss <b>rush</b> mode and Albus mode, with an alternate playable character. It also features online play, allowing the player to trade items with other players or go head-to-head in a versus mode.

30|$|Esler ([1967]) {{regarded}} {{the effects of}} grazing in the conversion of grassland to shrubland on Kapiti Island as diverse. Grazing either accelerates or retards succession of woody species depending on certain other site factors and can also determine which species are likely to succeed. He found that small areas of grassland remained on parts of Kapiti Island where heavy grazing occurred or {{where there was no}} grazing at all. Intensive grazing of pasture on fertile soils retarded the appearance of woody species but on other sites the invasion of manuka and kanuka ceased when sheep and goats were removed due the development of a dense deep turf. In management of hill country for pasture, intensity of grazing is a major factor in succession of woody species (Levy [1970]). Sheep and cattle grazing have different effects on reversion of hill country to woody species. Intense close grazing by sheep leads to invasion of manuka, <b>hard</b> fern and <b>rushes</b> whereas controlled grazing with cattle will maintain a permanent sward provided that clovers are kept growing strongly by applications of phosphate (ibid).|$|R
5000|$|Modern concert musicians make {{frequent}} use of drones, often with just or other non-equal tempered tunings. Drones are a regular feature in the music of composers indebted to the chant tradition, such as Arvo Pärt, Sofia Gubaidulina, and John Tavener. The single-tones that provided the impetus for minimalism through the music of La Monte Young {{and many of his}} students qualify as drones. David First, the band Coil, the early experimental compilations of John Cale (Sun Blindness Music, Dream Interpretation, and Stainless Gamelan), Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster, Alvin Lucier (Music On A Long Thin Wire), Ellen Fullman, Lawrence Chandler and Arnold Dreyblatt all make notable use of drones. The music of Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi is essentially drone-based. Shorter drones or the general concept of a continuous element are often used by many other composers. Other composers whose music is entirely based on drones include Charlemagne Palestine and Phill Niblock. Drone pieces also include Loren <b>Rush's</b> <b>Hard</b> Music (1970) [...] and Folke Rabe's Was?? (1968), as well as Robert Erickson's Down at Piraeus. The avant-garde guitarist Glenn Branca also uses drones extensively.|$|R

But almost everyone breaks this rule, ” says Graham Warren, scientific director of the Max F.

5000|$|Widely {{regarded}} as the group's best work, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been cited by critics and publications {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential recordings of all time. Upon the album's remastered reissue in 1995, Q hailed It Takes a Nation as [...] "the greatest rap album of all time, a landmark and classic". Also upon its reissue, Melody Maker called the album [...] "bloody essential" [...] and commented that [...] "I hadn't believed it could get <b>harder</b> Yo! Bum <b>Rush</b> the Show. Or better". NME dubbed it [...] "the greatest hip-hop album ever" [...] at the time, stating [...] "this wasn't merely a sonic triumph. This was also where Chuck wrote a fistful of lyrics that promoted him to the position of foremost commentator/documentor of life in the underbelly of the USA". Readers of Hip Hop Connection voted it the best album of all-time, prompting the magazine to comment, [...] "Even 'Rebel Without a Pause', a definite contender for best rap single ever released, failed to put the other 12 sic tracks to shame, such was the high standard throughout." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{desire to}} hear from you," [...] said Theophilus, [...] "when you have found the sum that will keep a woman from care. I know of women now inhabiting palaces, waited on at every turn by servants, with carriages, horses, jewels, laces, Cashmeres, enough for princesses, who are eaten up by care. One lies awake all night on account of a wrinkle in the waist of her dress; another is dying because no silk of a certain inexpressible shade {{is to be found}} in New York; a third has had a dress sent home, which has proved such a failure that life seems no longer worth having. If it were not for the consolations of religion, one doesn't know what would become of her. The fact is, that care and labor are as much {{correlated}} to human existence as shadow is to light; there is no such thing as excluding them from any mortal lot. You may make a canary-bird or a gold-fish live in absolute contentment without a care or labor, but a human being you cannot. Human beings are restless and active in their very nature, and will do something, and that something will prove a care, a labor, and a fatigue, arrange it how you will. As long as there is anything to be desired and not yet attained, so long its attainment will be attempted; so long as that attainment is doubtful or difficult, so long will there be care and anxiety. When boundless wealth releases woman from every family care, she immediately makes herself a new set of cares in another direction, and has just as many anxieties as the most toilful housekeeper, only they are of a different kind. Talk of labor, and look at the upper classes in London or in New York in the fashionable season. Do any women work <b>harder?</b> To <b>rush</b> from crowd to crowd all night, night after night, seeing what they are tired of, making the agreeable over an abyss of inward yawning, crowded, jostled, breathing hot air, and crushed in halls and stairways, without a moment of leisure for months and months, till brain and nerve and sense reel, and the country is longed for as a period of resuscitation and relief! Such is the release from labor and fatigue brought by wealth. The only thing that makes all this labor at all endurable is, that it is utterly and entirely useless, and does no good to any one in creation; this alone makes it genteel, and distinguishes it from the vulgar toils of a housekeeper. These delicate creatures, who can go to three or four parties a night for three months, would be utterly desolate if they had to watch one night in a sick-room; and though they can exhibit any amount of physical endurance and vigor in crowding into assembly rooms, and breathe tainted air in an opera-house with the most martyr-like constancy, they could not sit one half-hour in the close room where the sister of charity spends hours in consoling the sick or aged poor." ...|$|R
60|$|The captain put {{the fish}} away and {{cleaned up the}} boat and we resumed fishing. I ate lunch holding the rod in one hand, loath to waste any time on this {{wonderful}} day. Sailfish were still jumping {{here and there and}} far away. The next thing to happen was that R. C. hooked a small kingfish, and at the same instant a big one came clear out in an unsuccessful effort to get my bait. This happened to be near the reef, and as we were going out I hooked a big grouper that tried out my small tackle for all it was worth. But I managed to keep him from getting on the bottom, and at length brought him in. The little six-ounce tip now looked like a buggy-whip that was old and worn out. After that nothing happened for quite a little spell. We had opportunity to get rested. Presently R. C. had a sailfish tap his bait and tap it again and tug at it and then take hold and start away. R. C. hooked him and did it carefully, trying not to put too much strain on the line. Here is where great skill is required. But the line broke. After that he took one of my other tackles. Something went wrong with the engine and the captain had to shut down and we drifted. I had a long line out and it gradually sank. Something took hold and I hooked it and found myself fast to a deep-sea, hard-fighting fish of some kind. I got him up eventually, and was surprised to see a great, broad, red-colored fish, {{which turned out to be}} a mutton-fish, much prized for food. I had now gotten six varieties of fish in the Gulf Stream and we were wondering what next. I was hoping it would be a dolphin or a waahoo. It happened, however, to be a beautiful cero mackerel, one of the shapeliest and most attractive fish in these waters. He is built something like the brook-trout, except for a much sharper head and wider fins and tail. But he is speckled very much after the manner of the trout. We trolled on, and all of a sudden raised a school of sailfish. They came up with a splashing rush very thrilling to see. One hit R. C.'s bait hard, and then another, by way of contrast, began to tug and chew at mine. I let the line out slowly. And as I did so I saw another one follow R. C.'s mutilated bait which he was bringing toward the boat. He was a big purple-and-bronze fellow and he would have taken a whole bait if it could have been gotten to him. But he sheered away, frightened by the boat. I failed to hook my fish. It was getting along pretty well into the afternoon by this time and the later it got the better the small fish and kingfish seemed to bite. I caught one barracuda and six kingfish, while R. C. was performing a somewhat similar feat. Then he got a smashing strike from a sailfish that went off on a <b>hard,</b> fast <b>rush,</b> so that he hooked it perfectly. He jumped nine times, several of which leaps I photographed. He was a good-sized fish and active and strong. R. C. had him up to the boat in thirty minutes, which was fine work for the light tackle. I made sure that the fish was as good as caught and I did not look to see where he was hooked. My boatman is not skilled in the handling of the fish when they are brought in. Few boatmen are. He took hold of the leader, and as he began to lift I saw that the hook was fast in the bill of the sailfish fully six inches from his mouth. At that instant the sailfish began to thresh. I yelled to the boatman to let go, but either I was not quick enough or he did not obey, for the hook snapped free and the sailfish slowly swam away, his great purple-and-blue spotted sail waving in the water, and his bronze sides shining. And we were both glad that he had gotten away, because we had had the fun out of him and had taken pictures of him jumping, and he was now alive and might make another fisherman sport some day.|$|R
