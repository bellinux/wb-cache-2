40|$|Galactinol synthase (GS, UDP-α-d-galactose: 1 l-myo-inositol- 1 -O- α-d-galactopyranosyltransferase) is a {{key enzyme}} in the biosynthetic pathway of the {{raffinose}} family of oligosaccharides. The subcellular location of GS was studied in the parenchyma of stachyose-storing tubers of <b>Japanese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachys sieboldii) by isolation of protoplasts and vacuoles. A comparison of the activities of GS, malate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase (extravacuolar markers) and α-mannosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (vacuolar markers) in parenchyma protoplasts with those of vacuoles isolated from them showed that GS was an extravacuolar enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Vacuoles are {{the stores}} for {{large amounts of}} {{stachyose}} [αgal (1, 6) αgal (1, 6) αglc (1, 2) βfru] in tubers of <b>Japanese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachys sieboldii). The uptake of stachyose by these vacuoles was examined and {{compared with that of}} sucrose. The uptake mechanisms of both sugars were quite similar. The kinetics showed a single saturable response to increasing external concentrations of 14 C-sugars with similar apparent Km values of about 50 and 30 millimolar for stachyose and sucrose, respectively. The uptake rates, however, were always higher for stachyose than for sucrose. Stachyose and sucrose uptake was inhibited by fructose and raffinose, and, reciprocally, by sucrose and stachyose, but not by glucose or galactose. The main structural feature common to all sugars recognized by the uptake systems seems to be a terminal fructosyl residue. The uptake of both sugars was stimulated by Mg-ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate, suggesting a proton-sugar antiport system. The possibility that stachyose and sucrose might be transported by the same carrier is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Vacuoles of <b>Japanese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachys sieboldii) tubers {{accumulate}} up to 180 mM stachyose ([alpha]-galactose-[1 -> 6]-[alpha]-galactose-[1 -> 6]-[alpha]-glucose-[1 2]-[beta]-fructose) {{against a}} concentration gradient, probably {{by means of}} an active stachyose/H+ antiporter situated on the tonoplast. The goal {{of this study was to}} use isolated tonoplast vesicles to provide further evidence for the existence of such a transport mechanism. Therefore, vesicles were prepared from purified vacuoles of dormant tubers. ATP- and pyrophosphate (PPi) -dependent fluorescence quenching of the [delta]pH probe 9 -amino- 6 -chloro- 2 -methoxyacridine (ACMA) indicated that these vesicles were capable of building up a pH gradient ([delta]pH, inside acid). The potent V-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin prevented the formation of a [delta]pH in the vesicles. Bafilomycin (as well as nitrate, but not vanadate) also inhibited ATP hydrolysis, confirming the tonoplast origin of the isolated vesicles. Addition of stachyose (or sucrose, but not of mannitol) to energized vesicles caused a recovery of ACMA fluorescence, indicating a sugar-dependent dissipation of [delta]pH. The rate of fluorescence recovery was dependent on the external sugar concentration used. It displayed a single saturable response to increasing sugar concentrations. Apparent Km values of 52 and 25 mM were computed for stachyose and sucrose antiporter activities, respectively. It was also demonstrated that energized vesicles showed a much higher rate of [14 C]stachyose (3 mM) and [14 C]sucrose (1 mM) uptake than deenergized vesicles. The results obtained with isolated tonoplast vesicles were very similar to those obtained earlier with intact vacuoles and, therefore, confirm the existence of active stachyose and sucrose/H+ antiporters on the tonoplast of Stachys tuber vacuoles...|$|E
