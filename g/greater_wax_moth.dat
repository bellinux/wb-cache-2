40|$|Abstract. <b>Greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> (Galleria mellonella L., Pyraloidea) use {{ultrasound}} sensitive ears {{to detect}} clicking conspeci®cs and echolocating bats. Pyralid ears have four sensory cells, A 1 ± 4. The audiogram of G. mellonella has best frequency at 60 kHz with a threshold around 47 dB sound pressure level. A 1 and A 2 have almost equal thresholds {{in contrast to}} noctuids and geometrids. A 3 responds at + 12 to + 16 dB relative to the A 1 threshold. The threshold data from the A-cells give no indication of frequency discrimination in <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths.</b> Tethered <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> respond to ultrasound with short-latency cessation of ¯ight at + 20 to + 25 dB relative to the A 1 threshold.

40|$|Plant allelo{{chemicals}} are nonnutritional {{chemicals that}} interfere with the biology of herbivores. We posed the hypothesis that ingestion of a glycoalkaloid allelochemical, α-solanine, impairs biological parameters of <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> Galleria mellonella. To test this idea, we reared <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> on artificial diets with 0. 015, 0. 15, or 1. 5 mg/ 100 g diet of α-solanine. Addition of α-solanine to the diet affected survival of seventh-instar larvae, pupae, and adults; and female fecundity and fertility. The diet containing the highest α-solanine concentration led to decreased survivorship, fecundity, and fertility. The diets supplemented with α-solanine led to increased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in midgut and fat body and the effect was dose-dependent. Dietary α-solanine led to increased midgut glutathione S-transferase activity and to decreased fat body glutathione S-transferase activitiy. We infer from these findings that α-solanine influences life history parameters and antioxidative enzyme activities in the midgut and fat body of G. mellonell...|$|R
30|$|The peach fruit fly, Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) (Diptera: Tiphritidae), is an {{economic}} insect pest attacking the fruits of mangoes, apricots, guava, citrus, and peaches. This pest is difficult {{to be controlled by}} the traditional chemicals due to the behavior of its larvae that hide inside the fruits or its pupae that pupate in the soil. The present study documented the molecular identification and the first record of the entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis marelatus D 1 from Egypt. Environmental characterization showed that the new isolate was superior than the commercialized species, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, in heat tolerance (higher more than five times), desiccation tolerance (higher than four times), and hypoxic tolerance (higher than about two times). Comparative virulence of the reference nematode to the larvae of the <b>great</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth,</b> Galleria mellonella L., was carried out. When applied to the soil, the new isolate showed high potency in controlling B. zonata adults emerged from their pupae as it killed over 77 % of the adults within 48  h after emergence.|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} migration of infective juveniles of Neoaplectana glaseri {{applied to the}} soil surface or introduced 16 cm below the soil surface was studied in pure silica sand, coarse sandy loam, silty clay loam, and clay.

50|$|The female lays {{batches of}} between twenty and ninety eggs. These are {{barrel-shaped}} {{and have a}} number of small projections {{at the edge of the}} operculum. The nymphs go through five instars in their growth process and have bluish-black heads and thoraxes and red abdomens. The first instars stay close to the egg mass and the later instars also tend to group together, sometimes feeding on a common prey item. In the laboratory, the nymphs have fed on larvae of the <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> (Galleria mellonella), several stages of the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis), larvae of tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) and larvae of black cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon). Other recorded prey include beetles, planthoppers, weevils, larvae of the long-tailed skipper (Urbanus proteus), and the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula). The insects have been found on a range of plant types including ornamental plants, citrus, weeds, grasses, trees, bushes and other habitats.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the haemolymph juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHPB) {{family of}} proteins consists of several insect specific haemolymph juvenile hormone binding proteins. Juvenile hormone (JH) has {{a profound effect}} on insects. It regulates embryogenesis, maintains the status quo of larva development and stimulates reproductive maturation in the adult forms. JH is transported from the sites of its synthesis to target tissues by a haemolymph carrier called juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHBP). JHBP protects the JH molecules from hydrolysis by non-specific esterases present in the insect haemolymph. The crystal structure of the JHBP from Galleria mellonella (<b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth)</b> shows an unusual fold consisting of a long alpha-helix wrapped in a much curved antiparallel beta-sheet. The folding pattern for this structure closely resembles that found in some tandem-repeat mammalian lipid-binding and bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, with a similar organisation of the major cavity and a disulfide bond linking the long helix and the beta-sheet. It would appear that JHBP forms two cavities, only one of which, the one near the N- and C-termini, binds the hormone; binding induces a conformational change, of unknown significance.|$|E
40|$|In animals, {{successful}} {{production of}} the visual chromophore (11 -cis-retinal or derivatives thereof such as 11 -cis- 3 -hydroxy-retinal) is essential for photoreceptor cell function and survival. These carotenoid-derived compounds must combine with a protein moiety (the opsin) to establish functional visual pigments. Evidence from cell culture systems has implicated that the retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa (RPE 65) is the long-sought all-trans to 11 -cis retinoid isomerase. RPE 65 is structurally related to nonheme iron oxygenases that catalyze the conversion of carotenoids into retinoids. In vertebrate genomes, two carotenoid oxygenases and RPE 65 are encoded, whereas in insect genomes only a single representative of this protein family, named NinaB (denoting neither inactivation nor afterpotential mutant B), is encoded. We here cloned and functionally characterized the ninaB gene from the <b>great</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> Galleria mellonella. We show that the recombinant purified enzyme combines isomerase and oxygenase (isomerooxygenase) activity in a single polypeptide. From kinetics and isomeric composition of cleavage products of asymmetrical carotenoid substrates, we propose {{a model for the}} spatial arrangement between substrate and enzyme. In Drosophila, we show that carotenoid-isomerooxygenase activity of NinaB is more generally found in insects, and we provide physiological evidence that carotenoids such as 11 -cis-retinal can promote visual pigment biogenesis in the dark. Our study demonstrates that trans/cis isomerase activity can be intrinsic to this class of proteins and establishes these enzymes as key components for both invertebrate and vertebrate vision...|$|R
40|$|Female <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> Galleria mellonella display by wing fanning in {{response}} to bursts of ultrasonic calls produced by males. The temporal and spectral characteristics of these calls show some similarities with the echolocation calls of bats that emit frequency-modulated (FM) signals. Female G. mellonella therefore need {{to distinguish between the}} attractive signals of male conspecifics, which may lead to mating opportunities, and similar sounds made by predatory bats. We therefore predicted that (1) females would display {{in response}} to playbacks of male calls; (2) females would not display {{in response to}} playbacks of the calls of echolocating bats (we used the calls of Daubenton's bat Myotis daubentonii as representative of a typical FM echolocating bat); and (3) when presented with male calls and bat calls during the same time block, females would display more when perceived predation risk was lower. We manipulated predation risk in two ways. First, we varied the intensity of bat calls to represent a nearby (high risk) or distant (low risk) bat. Second, we played back calls of bats searching for prey (low risk) and attacking prey (high risk). All predictions were supported, suggesting that female G. mellonella are able to distinguish conspecific male mating calls from bat calls, and that they modify display rate in relation to predation risk. The mechanism (s) by which the moths separate the calls of bat and moth must involve temporal cues. Bat and moth signals differ considerably in duration, and differences in duration could be encoded by the moth's nervous system and used in discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> Galleria mellonella L.

Although the G. mellonella is often {{reported}} to infest weak honey bee colonies that are exposed to pesticides and diseases, {{it is also a}} threat for healthy colonies. Therefore, there is a fairly high probability of transmission of both microflora-specific bacteria and pathogen microorganisms, especially Nosema species, between these organisms (Moth and bees).

Treatments included different levels of gamma-ray dosages with zero, 250, 300, 350 and 400 gray. Release ratio of sterile to normal males was also studied in a similar experiment. Treatments included sterile-males, normal males and virgin females with the ratios of 1 : 1 : 1, 2 : 1 : 1, 3 : 1 : 1, 4 : 1 : 1 and 5 : 1 : 1. In this study, male pupae were irradiated with 350 grays of gamma-ray. The possible parthenogenetic reproduction of this pest was also studied. In order to compare the results from the male-sterile technique and the chemical control of this pest, another experiment was conducted in wax stores using 3 treatments with 3 replicates. Phostoxin was used as the most common chemical pesticide with a dosage of 1 tablet of 3 grams of 56 % per 1 m 3 space for the control of this pest. The results showed that the best dosage to sterilize male pupae of the <b>greater</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> was 350 grays of gamma-ray.
