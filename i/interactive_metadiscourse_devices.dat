40|$|Abstract—This study {{presents}} a qualitative, {{comparative study of}} interactive metadiscourse in the academic writing of two groups of Native speakers of English and Native speakers of Arabic doctorate students {{working in the field}} of linguistics. It investigates the writers ’ capability to deploy the propositional discourse and interpretations in a coherent and convincing way appropriate to the projected readers ’ comprehensive abilities. A small-scale sample of 80 ‘discussion ’ and ‘conclusion ’ chapters constitutes this corpus. This small-size corpus aligns with the contemporary trends in corpus-based work in the fields of English where smaller, more focused corpora, which have been set up for a specific research or pedagogical purpose, {{are much more likely to}} yield insights that are directly relevant to teaching and learning for specific purposes. Using Hyland's (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse, the discussion and conclusion chapters have been compared to examine the influence of intercultural and local institute academic culture contexts on the writers ’ use of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices.</b> The findings revealed a significant influence of the local institute culture on the Arab academic writing in most of the interactive subcategories.

40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Interpersonal Metadiscourse Markers used in Michelle Obama Speech. It has two objectives. First, it is aimed at finding out the types of {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers in each sentences used in Michelle Obama Speech. Second, it is aimed to explain the functions of them. This research uses qualitative research, because the research does not give the numeral or statictics, but just depends on {{the knowledge of the}} researcher in analyzing the data. The data of this study were analyzed by using some steps; first, reading the speech transcript; second, identifying and classifying the interpersonal metadiscourse markers, then, describing the function of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, and the last steps is interpreting the data and drawing conclusion. The result showed that there are two categories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers used in Michelle Obama Speech; those are <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse.</b> There are 165 (44, 2 %) <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> and 209 (55, 8 %) interactional <b>metadiscourse.</b> Kinds of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) code glosses and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of interactional metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant interactional metadiscourse, because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) engagement marker...|$|R

Through analyzing metadiscourse strategies employment in Persian and English (as the lingua franca of academic discourse community) research articles, this study makes an attempt to find out whether Persian native writers take on the identity and norms of the discourse community in writing in their own language or preserve the cultural identity and norms of their native language. A comparison of 36 Persian and 36 English research articles showed that, on the whole, the norms of Persian language in the use of metadiscourse were {{different from that of the}} academic discourse community.

The study compares English and Italian texts in an attempt to evaluate the extent of their correspondence and to uncover possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language. The analysis identifies some patterns of variation, which obviously need further research and the correlated expansion of the corpus. The English texts, for instance, display a higher number of evidentials, a different and wider variety of reporting verbs and more hedges, while the Italian ones show a higher incidence of inclusive first person plural forms of address as engagement markers...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to compare some metadiscourse features used in digital business communications. More specifically, we focus on the interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices</b> categorised as boosters. We analysed and compared a corpus of one hundred emails written by two groups of non-native speakers of English working in an export company and using English to communicate in a business environment. One group was composed of workers from Spain and the other was composed of workers from China. Our aim was to analyse the differences in the use of boosters and the causes of variation in their use, which may be related to the need to employ assertiveness or politeness in business contexts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article aims at {{reporting}} {{on some of}} the preliminary results of an on-going study on the difference of the use of metadiscourse strategies in e-mail writing between a Polish teacher and a Chinese student. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) Metadiscourse Theory, the purpose of the analysis is to show how the use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices</b> varies between an English-speaking person and a non English-speaking person in e-mail writing which covers a time period from 9 December 2013 to 1 January 2014. According to the analysis, we found out that metadisourse devices are frequently used in E-mail writing. Thanks to the different thinking mode and different ideology, people from different countries may use metadisourse devices differently. For example, the Polish Peter used more engagement markers than the Chinese student Tina did. While Tina used more hedges than Peter did. In this whole process, culture plays an important role...|$|R

Each student was asked to write a persuasive essay {{in his or her}} native Korean or English in response to a story not previously read or discussed. Analysis with a taxonomy developed by Hyland (2004) indicated significant differences in the metadiscourse by country. In terms of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> South Korean students used more sentence-level transitions than U. S. students, who used more frame markers and endophoric markers. With regard to interactional metadiscourse, U. S. students used more hedges, boosters, engagement markers, and self-mentions in their essays. This study also compared the students′ essays by the type of community in which the writers lived. In the US the essays of students in rural communities contained more hedges, whereas those of students in urban areas included significantly more self-mentions. In South Korea, no significant difference was detected in the metadiscourse of students living in rural and urban areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|R
40|$|To {{effectively}} teach university lecturers {{or students}} to write a good research article (RA) abstract for publication in international journals, instructors {{need to know the}} present characteristics of abstracts written published in such journals. This study examines the discourse structure and linguistic features of RA abstracts written in English by Indonesian academics published in national journals. The corpus for this study consists of 30 selected RA abstracts published mainly in university-based journals in Indonesia in social science and humanities disciplines. Analyses were conducted using genre-based procedures with a clause or a simple sentence as the smallest unit of analysis. The results show 1) unlike the common discourse structure of English abstracts found in RAs published in intenational journals, the majority English RA abstracts written by Indonesian speakers have only three moves (i. e. purpose, method and results); 2) the abstracts are mostly written in active sentence using present tense except for Move 3 (methods) in which a half of them are written in past tense and that-complement sentences are mostly found in Move 4 (results or findings); and 3) the use of interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices</b> are dominated by hedges found in Move 4 while the use of attitudinal stance markers of the writers and self-reference words is rarely found in the abstracts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Metadiscourse markers as rhetorical devices {{refer to}} ‘self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions’ (Hyland, 2004) {{that make the}} writers more powerful in interaction. Since metadiscourse is a rhetorical device, it could be different based on the user’s culture and mother tongue. In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al. (2010). The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian academic writers. To find the significant difference among the three corpora, the researchers used chi-square test. The findings of analyzing about 9000 lines of 26 published research articles on ELT and theoretical linguistics revealed the native Persian academic writers used <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in their L 1 writings more than the native English and non-native English academic writers (Iranian) whereas they used the least number of interactional metadiscourse (with the exception of self mentions). It was interesting that Persian academic writers used the most number of interactional metadiscourse markers when they wrote in L 2 (English). Regarding the other variable of the study i. e. gender, the findings further proved no relevance between gender and metadiscourse marker...|$|R

Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon of metadiscourse makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation of gender and metadiscourse to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their use of metadiscourse and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse, the study further aims to compare the use of metadiscourse markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices</b> were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements of metadiscourse in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall use of metadiscourse especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension of metadiscourse were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, engagement markers, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse,</b> and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type of metadiscourse were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices.</b> It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers and self-mentions). ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to seek two types of {{interpersonal}} model of Hyland (2005) used in conclusion sections of 30 Master Theses of English Teaching, English Literature, and English Translation written by male and female graduate students. These conclusion sections were categorized into two groups of male and female writers: 15 conclusion sections belonged to male writers and other 15 conclusion sections belonged to female writers. The <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were counted and analyzed to find if male or female writers utilize these metadiscourse markers differently or similarly in conclusion sections of English disciplines (Translation, Teaching, and Literature). These metadiscourse markers were analyzed descriptively and referentially. The descriptive analysis show that both male and female writers in Translation, Teaching and Literature applied more interactional markers than interactive ones. In Translation and Teaching, female writers used more interactional resources comparing to male writers. But, in Literature, male writers employed more interactional markers than female writers. The referential statistics indicate that in English Translation and English Literature, there are significant differences between male and female writers concerning use of <b>Interactive</b> and Interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> Markers, while in English Teaching, there are not any significant differences between male and female writers regarding use of these metadiscourse Markers...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} comparative {{exploration of the}} use of some metadiscourse resources in a small corpus of texts from popular scientific magazines in English and Italian, namely Scientific American (henceforth SA) and Le Scienze (henceforth LS). Scientific popularization is a meeting point of different discourse communities with their own needs, intentions and modes of communication (see Calsamiglia 2003, Myers 2003, Gotti 2005, 2013). Metadiscourse (cf., among others, Crismore and Farnsworth 1990, Crismore, Markkanen, Steffensen 1993, Hyland 1998, 2005) can be modulated and can modulate communication in different ways, as it covers a variety of linguistic elements which are aimed at organizing the text for its readers – the interactive dimension – and at engaging them in exposition and argumentation – the interactional dimension (see Hyland 2005). Recent research (e. g. Neff and Dafouz 2008, Musacchio and Ahmad 2009, Musacchio and Palumbo 2010, Suau 2010, Masi 2013) has indeed pursued comparisons of <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>devices</b> associated with scientific discourse domains and genres of popularisation in different languages to appraise the extent of cross-linguistic correspondence and avoid, for example, inappropriate translations. 	Special attention is here devoted to both interactive and interactional <b>devices</b> of <b>metadiscourse,</b> i. e. the representation of scientific and non-scientific ‘actors’ (cf. Calsamiglia 2003, Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) through a range of acts of reporting as evidentials, i. e. the most explicit form of inclusion of other-discourse/voice in one’s discourse, as well as through a selection of self-mention and engagement markers lending themselves to quantitative along with qualitative evaluation. Altogether, the variety of items under analysis can be viewed as representing the three axes (third person reference vs. I/we vs. you) for the construction and evaluation of the roles of different identities (including text producer and implied target receiver) in scientific popularisation. Language diversification, then, is here tackled both from the intra-linguistic standpoint of the different construction of identities within a form of media discourse, and from a cross-linguistic viewpoint, i. e. the extent to which such constructions differ in the two language samples in question, in the attempt to ultimately detect possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language represented in the corpus. The macro-analytical background presupposed by the works here referred to (in particular Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) is that of Critical Discourse Analysis, although the implications of the present research are also relevant for the perspective of Language Variation (and, to some extent, for Translation too) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for RA introductions and Hyland’s model of <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the metadiscoursal items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of metadiscoursal devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Middle School {{represents}} {{a period of}} transition for the students. This transition is present not only in physical change, intellectual change, and emotional change, but {{also in terms of}} the type of reading instruction these students receive. One approach to reading instruction moves from a direct approach focusing on specific skills, to a functional approach of how to apply those skills in the content area classroom. The latter approach is process oriented, and focuses on learning the content by reading and participating in relevant learning activities. The focus {{of this study was to}} examine the interaction which takes place among textbooks, instructors, and students in the area of Social Studies within selected middle schools. Three phases were involved in this study. Phase one: Grade six Social Studies textbooks were evaluated using the Singer Reading Inventory, which evaluates the areas of organization, explication, conceptual density, <b>metadiscourse,</b> and instructional <b>devices</b> within a given textbook. Phase two: Visitations to five middle school Social Studies classrooms were conducted over an eight week period in an effort to determine the types of instructional strategies employed by teachers. Phase three: Academic achievement was measured by publisher provided examinations, teacher prepared examinations, or an aggregate of daily scores. Hypothesis one: Social Studies textbooks which are more considerate will result in greater student achievement. This hypothesis was rejected. The achievement of students was inversely related to the results of the evaluation of the textbooks as determined by the Singer Reading Inventory. The rejection of this hypothesis must be qualified in terms of the content the subareas of the Singer Reading Inventory measured, and the type of information the student had to acquire in order to perform well academically. Hypothesis two: Teachers who employ more strategies which are of a functional process approach will enhance student achievement in the content areas. This hypothesis was retained. The preceeding findings may be partially explained by considering the possibility that some classroom instructors compensate for the inadequacies of textbooks by providing more effective strategies and activities which enhance the interaction of information exchange within the classroom...|$|R
40|$|Essay {{writing is}} one of the major {{academic}} practices that students are expected to master and display. As there is a paucity of information on the nature of sociocultural influence on second language education in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, this study attempts to contribute to knowledge on writing, in general, and on argument writing, in particular in the sociocultural context of the Vhembe District. The central premise for this study is that the way an environment constrains second language learners or frees them to explore and to learn is constituted by sociocultural factors and this includes pedagogical processes. In sociocultural theory, the argument is that to truly understand the human condition, there is a need to analyse and interpret it within the relevant social, cultural and historical context. This is because a learner’s cognitive, language and academic development are strongly influenced by the sociocultural context in which they live and learn and the effect could be either negative or positive. This is because the identity of a learner is constructed in subtle ways that align an individual’s aspirations with societal goals. In this alignment, learning is performance based, and it also functions as a self-check mechanism in which written discourse illuminates relations, such as the ones between discourse and value systems, which are transmitted through the education system. This study attempts to understand and explain second language writing within the Vhembe sociocultural context. Such understanding has emanated from abstractions from experience, the exploration of the literature reviewed for the purpose, and from the evaluation and interpretation of the students’ engagement in the samples, which have been included in the appendices. The students’ performance in writing was taken as an illustration of sociocultural influences. Using document analysis, observations and abstractions, the study found that students are not proficient in writing in general, because of sociocultural parameters, such as collectivism, weak uncertainty avoidance, a restricted code background, a culture of conserving knowledge, lack of discursive interaction, content orientation and first language literacy. Pedagogy also has an influence on competence, because of the way writing is approached in the learning/teaching situations. Learners seem to have a limited capacity in constructing sentences in the correct tense, use of both <b>metadiscourse</b> and cohesive <b>devices.</b> The study indicates the need to consider learners’ social identity as well as their environment as a way of illustrating the complexity and pertinence of socioculture. This recognition has been given assent through the intervention strategies that are explored and built into the recommendation. The recommendation is that the natural context in which the learners are immersed should be given clarity and should be explored in the English lesson. In this regard, intervention approaches and strategies for learner activities are based on this schema and on collaboration between facilitators of English language learning and content and Mother Tongue facilitators.
