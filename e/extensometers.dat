Using a state of the art <b>extensometer</b> of non-contact type, foam properties as ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and the Young's modulus (E) have been measured accurately. A state-of-the art <b>extensometer</b> of non-contact type was applied {{for the first time to}} help the foam's mechanical properties to be determined accurately. The reason behind the usage of this kind of <b>extensometer</b> is to avoid even any small deformation that might be caused by the attachment of conventional <b>extensometer</b> to the sample prior to testing. The function of the <b>extensometer</b> is based on the usage of a laser (CCD) camera that detects and records the dimensional changes as soon as the load is applied.

An array of FBG sensors on a single fiber with varying Bragg wavelengths ( [...] B), has been used to spatially resolve the strains along the height of the specimen. It is interesting to note from the obtained stress-strain curves that the initial tangent modulus obtained using the FBG sensor is lower compared to that obtained using clip-on <b>extensometer.</b> The results also indicate that the strains measured by both FBG and <b>extensometer</b> sensor follow the same trend and both the sensors register the maximum strain value at the same time...|$|R

The effect of prestrain on the <b>extensometer</b> deflection versus specimen strain curve has been studied experimentally and analytically. An analytical study shows that an increase in the slope of the stress-strain curve in the inelastic region increases the slope of the corresponding computed <b>extensometer</b> deflection versus specimen strain curve. A mathematical model has been developed which uses a modified length ¯ℓef in place of the actual length of the uniform diameter test section of the specimen.

In this work, the {{shear modulus}} and {{strength}} of the acrylic adhesive 3 M ® DP- 8005 was evaluated by two different methods: the Thick Adherend Shear Test (TAST) and the Notched Plate Shear Method (Arcan).
