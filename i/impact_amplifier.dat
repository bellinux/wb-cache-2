Then a finite element model of a bridge pier is established including the effects of water flow impact {{as well as the}} water circumferential motion around the pier. Comparative study is conducted between the results of water impact effect, fluid-structure coupling effect, theoretical analysis, and also the results derived using the formulas specified in the design codes home and abroad.

40|$|This {{inductive}} {{case study}} of 7 US university technology transfer offices (TTOs) examines the value added that TTOs contribute to university-industry technology transfer (UITT). We therefore (i) characterize a set of central organizational TTO practices, (ii) describe how TTOs systemically manage intangible resources to generate these practices, and (iii) describe the conceptual mechanisms through which the practices add value to UITT. The results form an inductive framework that establishes the TTO as (i) a process catalyst that lowers the threshold of UITT stakeholders to engage in technology transfer and to maintain its sustainability, (ii) a knowledge converter that enables congruence between university technology and market needs, and (iii) an <b>impact</b> <b>amplifier</b> that alleviates problems related to the opportunistic incentive structures of UITT stakeholders and maximizes societal impact.

30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an analytical}} {{study of the}} <b>impact</b> of high-power <b>amplifier</b> (HPA) nonlinear distortion (NLD) on the bit error rate (BER) of multicarrier techniques. Two schemes of multicarrier modulations are considered in this work: the classical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the filter bank-based multicarrier using offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM), including different HPA models. According to Bussgang’s theorem, the in-band NLD is modeled as a complex gain {{in addition to an}} independent noise term for a Gaussian input signal. The BER performance of OFDM and FBMC/OQAM modulations, transmitting over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, is theoretically investigated and compared to simulation results. For simple HPA models, such as the soft envelope limiter, it is easy to compute the BER theoretical expression. However, for other HPA models or for real measured HPA, BER derivation is generally intractable. In this paper, we propose a general method based on a polynomial fitting of the HPA characteristics and we give theoretical expressions for the BER for any HPA model.|$|R

40|$|Kevin Kornegay, Alyssa Apsel, Lester EastmanAn {{integrated}} {{power amplifier}} and DC-DC converter are presented {{to create a}} variable supply voltage power amplifier to improve battery life in cellular handsets. This system {{has the ability to}} reduce the average battery current drawn by a handset power amplifier by operating at lower supply voltages when not transmitting at maximum power. This type of system has not been adopted because of the need for additional circuitry when used with traditional power amplifier modules. To be attractive to system designers, advanced power amplifiers need to exhibit the integration that has been seen in modern radio receivers. In this work, SiGe BiCMOS technology is harnessed to achieve the integration of both circuits on one die, presenting a solution to the desire for high efficiency in a single chip solution. The design of power amplifiers in SiGe technology is explored, with a focus on the design of a WCDMA handset power amplifier for third generation mobile systems. The design challenges of such a circuit are presented, along with a design methodology involving a mix of time and frequency domain simulation techniques. Layout concerns are addressed in regards to the SiGe BiCMOS process, and their <b>impact</b> on power <b>amplifier</b> performance is highlighted. Measured results are presented which meet the linearity requirements of WCDMA. A high switching frequency DC-DC converter is also examined, with a focus on integration of such a circuit with a power <b>amplifier.</b> The <b>impact</b> of frequency selection and converter efficiency is analyzed, and several techniques to improve the efficiency are presented. Simulation and measurement results are presented which show excellent agreement over the broad range of converter operating conditions. An analysis method for determining the average reduction of battery current in a variable supply voltage system is presented, with results given for the DC-DC converter/power amplifier integrated system. The integration issues and system performance in regards to physical layout are discussed. The final system measurements show the successful performance of the power amplifier under variable supply voltage operation with the DC-DC converter.

40|$|Modeling of {{the effects}} {{occurring}} outside the usual region of application of semiconductor devices is becoming more important with increasing demands set upon electronic systems for simultaneous speed and output power. Analog integrated circuit designers are forced to enter regimes of transistor operation that are close to or within the device breakdown. They use compact models that describe device behavior in {{an efficient way to}} predict a designed circuit performance. Using modern heterojunction bipolar transistors with superb maximum unity current gain and maximum unity power gain frequencies, necessarily brings with it ever lower breakdown voltages. Impact ionization that causes avalanche multiplication has a profound <b>impact</b> on power <b>amplifiers</b> and plays a dominant role in the region of high output voltages, necessary for driving antennas of modern (ultra) wideband wireless systems. On the other hand, digital circuit designs mostly suffer from high transistor leakage current that {{in the state of the}} art digital solutions takes up significant portion of the total power dissipation of a digital system. Therefore, it is of essence for digital integrated circuit designers to posses an accurate prediction of the leakages so that they may continue to grasp benefits of transistor downscaling. In this thesis, starting from impact ionization, firstly, physics behind this phenomenon is studied. Frequency limitations of avalanche models are analytically derived in Chapter 2. A derivation is followed by the description of usual approaches for addressing impact ionization effects in semiconductor devices. Emphasized is the most frequently used, impact ionization rates approximation. The last part of the chapter is reserved for compact modeling of avalanche multiplication in semiconductor devices. This chapter presents a foundation for the two chapters that follow. Chapter 3 focuses on quasidistributed bipolar transistor model reduction techniques. This model type is employed to describe complex multidimensional vertical current pinch-in effects that may occur in transistors biased within the avalanche region. A simplification method for the model is introduced, based on an implementation of bilinear approximation. Excellent matches between the original and reduced model are obtained. The model complexity is reduced from quadratic to linear dependency on size, nevertheless, the speed gain is not that dramatic. Implications of impact ionization on bipolar transistors in terms of working in the small alternating signal environment are explored next. Specifically, in such cases avalanche characterization is important in order to proceed with deeper analysis. Chapter 4 gives a derivation proof that avalanche in the small signal drive conditions may be studied by observing the real parts of admittance parameters when transistor is viewed through its two-port network representation. Addressed are the needs for an accurate modeling of such regimes. Repercussions of avalanche on some important intrinsic active device properties from circuit design prospective are discussed in general. Collapse of unilateral power gain and increase of transistor stability are demonstrated and physically explained through the concept of intrinsic avalanche-induced negative feedback. The frequency above which avalanche effects in small signal conditions can be neglected is identified. A description of a novel model for the band-to-band tunneling current in p-n junctions is shown in Chapter 5. The presented work consists of the model physical foundations, implementation and finally its verification against state of the art industrial and modern in-house device measurements. The developed tunneling breakdown model is fully physics-based and may be used both in bipolar as well as in field-effect compact transistor models. It is smooth in a mathematical sense on a whole real domain, thus escaping any potential solver convergence problems. The derived model features increased efficiency without compromising accuracy since it is not evaluated in the forward bias regime where the Zener tunneling current identically equals zero. Innovative parametrization of the model equation (in a statistical sense) drastically reduces the influence of randomness inevitably present in the measured data on which parameters are estimated, on dispersion of the extracted parameter values. As a consequence scaling over geometry and temperature is greatly improved. Parameter extraction techniques in compact modeling in general have a crucial role. However, if several extraction methodologies for estimation of certain model parameter(s) exist, it is not trivial to select the best, that is, the preferred one. It is even unclear how ``the best'' strategy should be defined. Chapter 6 is devoted to this important topic, namely the analysis of parameter extraction strategies and parameter optimization. Since this thesis concentrates on modeling of breakdown phenomena that are driven by the electric field within the p-n junction's space charge region, accent is drawn to the p-n junction parameters and their estimation methodologies. More precisely, obtaining parameters of the depletion capacitance and ideal diode current compact model parameters is covered in detail. The estimation strategies are compared in statistical terms which provide an insight in how the two, or more, can be assessed and compared, and which one would be more suitable for use in practice. In particular, it is demonstrated that it is much favorable to extract parameters simultaneously with their (temperature) scaling parameter rather than separately. Additionally, an approach to assess statistical properties of an arbitrary parameter extraction strategy and demonstrate the merits of such assessments is presented.
