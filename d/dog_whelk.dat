5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, flatfishes, and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark. It also consumes crustaceans, in particular crabs but also hermit crabs and large shrimp, and cephalopods. Given the opportunity, this shark will scavenge. Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods, and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei. The netted <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> (Nassarius reticulatus) preys on the nursehound's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} {{polymorphic}} for different chromosome structural forms. The structural variation {{may be associated}} with different numbers of chromosomes in different individuals, which occurs in the ladybird beetle Chilocorus stigma, some mantids of the genus Ameles, the European shrew Sorex araneus. There is some evidence from the case of the mollusc Thais lapillus (the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk)</b> on the Brittany coast, that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of TBT and other tin-based anti-fouling coatings on marine vessels {{was a major}} environmental problem. TBT {{has been shown to}} harm many marine organisms, specifically oysters and mollusks. Extremely low concentrations of tributyltin moiety (TBT) causes defective shell growth in the oyster Crassostrea gigas (at a concentration of 20ng/l) and development of male characteristics in female genitalia in the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> Nucella lapillus (where gonocharacteristic change is initiated at 1ng/l).|$|E
50|$|On September 29, 2007, the Halifax, Nova Scotia based {{newspaper}} The Chronicle Herald {{featured a}} story on female <b>dog</b> <b>whelks</b> {{on the shores of}} Halifax Harbour and other parts of Nova Scotia, where they live on the beach in the intertidal zone. The report stated that female <b>dog</b> <b>whelks</b> still grow penises even after a ban on tributyltin.|$|R

25|$|Many {{other species}} {{worldwide}} {{within the family}} Muricidae, for example Plicopurpura pansa, from the tropical eastern Pacific, and Plicopurpura patula from the Caribbean zone of the western Atlantic, can also produce a similar substance (which turns into an enduring purple dye when exposed to sunlight) and this ability has sometimes also been historically exploited by local inhabitants in the areas where these snails occur (Some other predatory gastropods, such as some wentletraps in the family Epitoniidae, seem to also produce a similar substance, although {{this has not been}} studied or exploited commercially). The <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> Nucella lapillus, from the North Atlantic, {{can also be used to}} produce red-purple and violet dyes.|$|E
500|$|Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach {{themselves}} to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of keratin and proteins. They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks (Buccinidae) and murex snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells, although many Busyconine whelks (e.g., Busycon sinistrum, Busycon carica) are [...] "chipping-style" [...] predators. The <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> (Nucella lamellosa) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body {{contents of the}} victim, which is typically a blue mussel. The whelk needs {{a few hours to}} penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in.|$|E
2500|$|Marine mussels are {{eaten by}} humans, starfish, seabirds, and by {{numerous}} species of predatory marine gastropods {{in the family}} Muricidae, such as the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk,</b> Nucella lapillus. Freshwater mussels are eaten by otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans (off the coast of South Africa) and geese, although {{the main cause of}} mortality is starfish.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk,</b> {{the growth}} of a penis in imposex females {{gradually}} blocks the oviduct, although ovule production continues. An imposex female <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> passes through several stages of penis growth before it becomes unable to maintain a constant production of ovules. Later stages of imposex lead to sterility and the premature death of the females of reproductive age, which can adversely affect the entire population.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> {{lives in}} rocky shores, and estuarine conditions. Climatically it lives between the 0°C and 20°C isotherms.|$|E
50|$|Predators of the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> include {{various species}} of crabs and birds. Protection against {{predation}} from crabs which attempt {{to pull the}} soft body out through the shell aperture can be afforded by growing teeth {{around the edge of}} the aperture. Many predators cannot smash the strong shell of an adult <b>dog</b> <b>whelk,</b> but juveniles are vulnerable to attack from many predatory species. Eider ducks and various other birds simply swallow the entire body with its shell, while oystercatchers and various crustaceans are often capable of crushing or breaking the shells. In the winter they endure more predation from purple sandpipers and similar wading birds, but in the summer crabs represent a greater threat. In general, the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> can be thought of as being vulnerable to birds when emersed, and to crabs when immersed.|$|E
50|$|The peak in <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> {{population}} density is approximately coincidental with the mid-tidal zone. It {{lives in the}} middle shore. In general {{it can be said}} that at high vertical heights on the shoreline the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> is most threatened by biotic factors such as predation from birds and interspecific competition for food, but abiotic factors are the primary concern, creating a harsh environment in which it is difficult to survive. At low vertical heights it is biotic factors, such as predation from crabs and intraspecific competition, which cause problems. The upper limit of the range in which the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> is generally found is approximately coincidental with the mean high water neap tide line, and the lower limit of the range is approximately coincidental with the mean low water neap tide line, so that the vast majority of dog whelks are found on the mid-tidal zone.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> {{can only}} survive {{out of water}} for a limited period, as it will {{gradually}} become desiccated and die if emersed for too long. Metabolic processes within cells take place in solution, {{and a decrease in}} water content makes it impossible for the organism to function properly. In experiments {{it has been shown that}} 50% of dog whelks die at 40°C, and it can be assumed that at temperatures lower than this a smaller proportion will be killed off. Furthermore, the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> has to excrete ammonia directly into water, as it does not have the adaptation possessed by many upper shore species which would allow it to produce uric acid for excretion without loss of water. When kept emersed for seven days at a temperature of 18°C, 100% of dog whelks die, in contrast to many periwinkle species which can lose even more water than the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> (i.e. more than 37% of their total body mass) but survive as a result of their ability to excrete toxic waste products more efficiently.|$|E

50|$|At low tide, park {{visitors}} can explore {{the ocean floor}} where a variety of sea creatures (e.g., <b>dog</b> <b>whelk,</b> periwinkles, various seaweeds) cling to life. At high tide, the ocean floor disappears under 15 m (50 ft)of salt water.|$|E
50|$|Tidal {{pools and}} {{comparable}} microhabitats extend the vertical range of organisms {{such as the}} <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> as they provide a more constant environment, but they are prone to increased salinity because evaporation concentrates dissolved substances. This can create toxic conditions for many species.|$|E
50|$|Tributyltin {{is harmful}} to some marine organisms, {{including}} the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk,</b> it causes dog whelks {{to suffer from}} imposex; females develop male sexual characteristics such as a penis. This causes them to become infertile or even die. In severe cases, males can develop egg sacs.|$|E
50|$|Wave action {{tends to}} confine the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> to more {{sheltered}} shores, however, {{this can be}} counteracted, both by adaptations to tolerate it such as the shell and muscular foot, and by the avoidance of direct exposure to wave action afforded by making use of sheltered microhabitats in rocky crevices. The preferred substrate material of the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> is solid rock and not sand, which adds to its problems at lower levels on the shore where weathering {{is likely to have}} reduced the stability of the seabed. Water loss by evaporation has to be tolerated (by means of the operculum which holds water in and prevents its escape as vapour), or avoided (by moving into water or a shaded area).|$|E
50|$|In 1946, French {{archaeologist}} Francoise Henry excavated {{evidence of}} a 7th-century AD dye workshop on Inishkea North where the monks in an early Christian Monastery were producing it from the shells of the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> The dye fetched high prices {{at the time it}} was in high demand.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{believed}} that the only inducer of imposex was tributyltin (TBT), which can be active in extremely low concentrations, but recent studies reported other substances as inducers, such as triphenyltin and ethanol. [...] Tributyltin is an anti-fouling agent for boats which affects females of the species Nucella lapillus (<b>dog</b> <b>whelk),</b> Voluta ebraea (the Hebrew volute), Olivancillaria vesica, Stramonita haemastoma (red-mouthed rock shell) and more than 200 other marine gastropods.|$|E
50|$|Objects {{carved from}} bone include {{spatulas}} and toggles. A handle {{was made from}} red deer antler, and pendants were made from horse and dog teeth. Pointed bone tools were carved from sheep tibiae or roe deer metapodials. Shells had been perforated for use as pendants, using shells from Nucella lapillus (<b>dog</b> <b>whelk),</b> and Littorina obtusata - both of which species had to be transported from the coast.

50|$|Its adaptations {{include a}} {{modified}} radula (a toothed chitinous structure) to bore {{holes in the}} shells of prey, complemented by an organ on the foot which secretes a shell-softening chemical. When a hole has been formed paralysing chemicals and digestive enzymes are secreted inside the shell to break the soft body down into a ‘soup’ which can be sucked out with the proboscis. Mussels have developed a defensive strategy of tethering and immobilising with byssus threads any dog whelks invading their beds, leading to the whelks' starvation. The plates of barnacles can be pushed apart with the proboscis, and the entire individual is eaten in about a day, although larger animals such as mussels may take {{up to a week}} to digest. Feeding only occurs when conditions are conducive to such an activity, and during these times the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> consumes large quantities of food so that the gut is always kept as full as possible. This allows shelter until more food is required, when foraging resumes. If waves are large or there is an excessive risk of water loss the <b>dog</b> <b>whelk</b> will remain inactive in sheltered locations for long periods.|$|E
