5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E

In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, {{as well as the}} arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E

25|$|While {{attempting}} to make a living, they began to experiment with tape machines, photography, and anything remotely to do with art that they could <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on. Word of their experimentation spread and in 1969, a British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist named Phil Lithman and the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) N. Senada (whom Lithman had picked up in Bavaria where the aged avant-gardist was recording birds singing) paid them a visit, and decided to remain.|$|E

25|$|Under Edward VI, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{sponsored}} an act allowing Newcastle to annexe Gateshead as its suburb.

However, when Mary I came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories {{and as a result}} coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the number}} of Pomo basket weavers has decreased, their skill and artistic vision is still intact, and people pay a pretty penny to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on the art. Today, new Pomo baskets might sell {{for as much as}} $1,000, and the more {{historical}} ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{practices}} employed by Special Circumstances {{would be considered}} distasteful even {{in the context of}} a Western democracy. Examples are the use of mercenaries to perform the work that the Culture does not want to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> dirty with, and even outright threats of invasion (the Culture has issued ultimatums to other civilizations before). Some commentators have also argued that those SC agents tasked with civilising foreign cultures (and thus potentially also changing them into a blander, more Culture-like state) are also those most likely to regret these changes, with parallels drawn to real-world special forces trained to operate within the cultural mindsets of foreign nations.|$|E

On October 22, reports started coming out that a few gamers in Europe and other regions had managed to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on retail copies of Uncharted 3, all thanks to retailers breaking the street release date.

25|$|In February, Natural Disasters' manager Jimmy Hart led Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster) to the WWF tag team titles as they {{defeated}} the Legion of Doom {{after which the}} L.O.D. briefly left the WWF. The Natural Disasters were outraged that their manager would go behind their backs and get another team {{a shot at the}} title, the storyline explanation was that Jimmy Hart used the Disasters' guaranteed return match for Money Inc. When the Natural Disasters challenged Money Inc. they won the fan support as they fired manager Jimmy Hart. The Disasters would first <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on Money Inc. at WrestleMania VIII where once again the Natural Disasters would win the match but not the titles as the champions were counted out. The Disasters did not let the setback stop them as they challenged for the titles repeatedly until they won them on July 20, 1992.|$|E
25|$|A {{new policy}} on debt collection, {{enforced}} in November 1903, {{also played a}} role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist traders at extreme interest rates. For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on, to recoup their loans as quickly as possible. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that German officials were sympathetic to the traders who were about to lose what they were owed.|$|E

False prophecies, time travel, and betrayal lead to Angel losing his infant son to an old enemy, Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), who abducts Connor into a hell dimension where time passes differently. Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) returns days later, fully grown and under the belief that Angel is a soulless monster. Holtz kills himself and Angel is framed for his death by Holtz's lover, prompting Connor to take revenge by sinking his father {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. Over the course of this season, Angel's friendship with his colleague Cordelia evolves into romance, but circumstances prevent him from confessing his feelings.|$|E

Father Pirrone ponders the long-standing family feud between Pirrone's father and his uncle. After saying Mass, he goes to visit his uncle and manipulates both him and Santino into accepting what he proposes as the terms of marriage. Back home, Father Pirrone persuades Angelina's grudging father into agreeing {{to the terms of}} marriage by sacrificing his own inheritance. Santino and his father arrive; the marriage is contracted, and the young people are happy. Later, while travelling back to the Salina Palace, Father Pirrone is certain that Santino and his father planned Angelina's seduction so they could <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on property they believed was rightfully theirs, and also realizes that the nobility and the peasants are, at least on one level, far more similar than he once thought.|$|E
25|$|There are traditions on Lewis which {{tell how}} the Macaulays were massacred by the Macleods {{sometime}} in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Macaulays held farms at Reef, Valtos and Kneep in Uig, which were next to farms held by Tormod Mòr, brother of Ruaidhri chief of Lewis. Tormod Mòr's son, Tormod Oig, {{was said to have}} held the farm of Baile na Cille, also in Uig. According to Thomas, the chief of Lewis allowed all the rent collected from Uig go to the upkeep of Tormod Mòr and his family (known on Lewis as Clann Thormoid). When a dispute over cattle arose Tormod Mòr was injured and in revenge his sons led the Macleod clansmen to murder almost every Macaulay they could <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> on. Tradition has it that the only survivors of the Macaulays were the chief's youngest son Iain Ruadh and his illegitimate half-brother. According to Matheson, this tradition may be a muddled account of the Earl of Huntly's expedition to Lewis in 1506. In that year Huntly invaded the island to suppress the rebellion of the Lord of the Isles claimant Donald Dubh who had been under the protection of Torquil Macleod of Lewis. During the conflict Clann Thormoid and the Morrisons of Ness seem to have sided with the invaders against the Lewismen (which both clans did again when the Mackenzies invaded and conquered Lewis about 100 years later; see Conquest of Lewis section below).|$|E
