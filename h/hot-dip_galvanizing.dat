5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanizing</b> a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts.

5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (<b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanizing)</b> is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> {{steel sheets}} as base {{material}} for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of the seam. High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to the seam edges. Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed at the seam edges on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc at the seam edges takes place during the brazing of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy at the seam edges. The optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation. Brazing trials on <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> and phosphated substrates, which show a reflectance similar to electro galvanized and phosphated specimens, confirm this assumption, as no spatter formation at the seam edge was observed...|$|R
