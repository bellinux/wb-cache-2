40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} solid oxide electrolyzer based on an electrolyte having both oxygen ion and proton conductivity is considered. The main parameters of the electrolytic process and an electrolyzer (distribution of gas components, <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> and current densities along the electrolyzer channel, average values of <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> and current densities) were calculated depending on a proton transport number and mode of the reactants' feeding (co- and counter-flow). The performed analysis demonstrates considerable influence of the mode of feeding on all parameters of the electrolyzer: operation under the counter-flow mode is preferable as regards the specific characteristics and uniformity of their distribution along the electrolyzer. It is shown that the electrolyser's specific characteristics increase {{with the increase of}} the proton transport number. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|It {{is evident}} that the method {{used in the present}} {{research}} is chiefly empirical; it consists of a comparison of the <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> generated by systems containing various substances as central conductors, with that of systems containing tissues in the center. The method of H#{ 246 }berand his pupils had been essentially the same, however, he limited the comparison by omitting the ex-amination of certain materials as, e. g., lecithin-taking it for granted that volatile oils were equivalent to lipods-and further-more by omitting all colloids except proteins-which led him to believe that new protein effects had been discovered (1). The extension of these experiments to a still larger group of substances must, therefore, be our aim. One more group of salts is mentioned here which produce peculiar effects, viz., alkaloidal salts.

25|$|When the {{electric}} current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience {{this change in}} magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, d ΦB / d t.

25|$|A Faraday disk {{can also}} be {{operated}} with neither a galvanometer nor a return path. When the disk spins, the electrons collect along the rim and leave a deficit near the axis (or the other way around).

This charge separation will be proportional to the relative rotational velocity between the disk and the magnet.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Septal {{necrosis}} + peripheral left blocks. Because of {{an extensive}} septal necrosis, {{the manifestation of}} the initial ventricular activation forces decreases in the precordial leads. With left bifascicular block (LASB + LPSB), the first ventricular activation forces become more evident and the electrical signs of septal necrosis can be concealed. In {{the presence of a}} trifascicular block, manifestation of the first ventricular <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> diminishes again and the electrical signs of septal necrosis become evident once more. Small Q waves are present in leads V 1 to V 4. Extensive anterior necrosis + peripheral blocks. This necrosis is manifested by QS complexes from V 2 to V 6. An associated left bifascicular block reduces the electrical manifestation of dead tissue: QS complexes persist only in V 3 and V 4. In turn, a coexisting trifascicular block causes the presence of QS complexes from V 2 to V 5. Posteroinferior necrosis + peripheral blocks. <b>Electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> of the ventricular activation shift upward, due to a posteroinferior necrosis and QS or QR complexes are recorded in leads aVF, II and III. An associated left bifascicular block displaces the main <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> downward, posteriorly and to the left, due to a delay of the posteroinferior activation fronts. The ventricular complexes become positive and wider in all leads, reflecting the potential variations of the inferior portions of the left ventricle: aVF, II, III, sometimes V 5 and V 6. Consequently, the electrical signs of necrosis are reduced or abolished. Due to a trifascicular block, wide and slurred QS complexes are recorded in aVF, II, III and sometimes in V 5 and V 6.

25|$|The EMF {{generated}} by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and {{a magnetic field}} is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> is created. If the wire is connected through an electrical load, current will flow, and thus electrical energy is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the drum generator {{is based upon the}} figure to the right. A different implementation of this idea is the Faraday's disc, shown in simplified form on the right.|$|E

25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (<b>electromotive</b> <b>force).</b> Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E

25|$|Electrophoresis {{refers to}} the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (EMF) {{that is used to}} move the {{molecules}} through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the cathode which is negatively charged (because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell). If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (<b>electromotive</b> <b>force)</b> or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E
25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the contact potential. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.|$|E
