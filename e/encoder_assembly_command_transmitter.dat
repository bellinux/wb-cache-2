30|$|Using this {{approach}} each Asm file’s content {{is converted to}} a contiguous string of gene sequence characters. Furthermore, this encoding gives each <b>assembly</b> <b>command</b> or Asm file token a common length. Unique <b>assembly</b> <b>commands</b> and tokens collected ranged from 2 to 15 characters in length. Processing this data in a fashion similar to the bytes files as raw text would result {{in many of the}} unique token values being broken across each gene sequence word created during Strand training and classification processing. For example, creating gene sequence words within Strand of length 50 would ensure that each gene sequence word contained a block of five <b>assembly</b> <b>commands</b> or Asm file tokens. After testing word sizes of 45, 50, 55, and 60, empirical results showed that a block of five commands optimized both sensitivity and precision during classification processing.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Megamile {{communications}} {{call for}} the fullest use of advanced modern technology. This paper surveys {{the design of a}} deep-space communication system. The basic constraints and capabilities of a low-noise ground receiving system are covered in detail, including antenna temperature contributions from galactic noise, tropospheric and ionospheric attenuation, and earth radiation through antenna side lobes. Low-noise preamplifiers, large high-gain antennas, and narrow-band phase-lock receivers are also considered. Digital biphase modulation, used in Pioneer V, is compared with more sophisticated bi-orthogonal coding systems. Both types of coding systems are compared with error rate as a parameter, with the ideal error-free Shannon limit. The design of Pioneer V and its record of achievement are described. Included are explanations of the coherent transponder within the spacecraft, and of the <b>command</b> <b>transmitter</b> and telemetry reception equipment at the ground stations. 1...|$|R

At Piraeus, Phocion was holding a conference with Nicanor when Athenian soldiers interrupted, to jail the Macedonian general. Nonetheless, Phocion helped his escape, declaring: [...] "I don't believe that he would harm Athens although, still, I would defend him if he may wrong us." [...] Subsequently, the Athenian <b>Assembly</b> <b>commanded</b> that Phocion should attack Nicanor, at Munychia. Initially, Phocion refused.

The primary reason for this large gain in performance is a substantial reduction in input data required for processing when compared to the bytes file models. For instance, 10, 873 test data files generated for Asm sequences requires 720 MB size on disk while the same number of corresponding bytes files required 47.3 GB. Likewise, 10, 868 training files generated for Asm sequences required 773 MB on disk while the same number of corresponding bytes files also require 47.3 GB.

40|$|The Supreme Court's recent {{decision}} in Kelo v. New London allows {{the use of}} eminent domain to facilitate private economic development. While the court's condition for allowing takings was highly expansive, {{there may be a}} market failure that warrants state intervention when parcels of land need to be combined for redevelopment. The collective action or strategic holdout problem associated with land assembly may limit redevelopment of older communities when one or more existing owners seek to capture a disproportionate share of the potential surplus. The problem may be compounded by landowners' uncertainty as to the true value of the expected surplus to be divided (Eckart, 1985; Strange, 1995). At the same time, developers may attempt to disguise the assemblage through the use of straw purchasers. This paper employs administrative Geographic Information System and assessor data from Seattle, Washington, to identify lots that were ultimately assembled. The paper then matches them to their pre-assembly sales. Controlling for lot and existing structure characteristics and census tract-year fixed effects, I find that land bought in the process of a successful <b>assembly</b> <b>commands</b> an 18 percent premium. Consistent with theory, this premium falls with a parcel's relative size in the assemblage. I also find some evidence that parcels {{toward the center of the}} development may command a larger premium than those at the edge, suggesting that developers retain or are perceived to retain some design flexibility...|$|R
