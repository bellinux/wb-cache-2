40|$|Subrogation {{means that}} a person who indemnifies another is {{entitled}} to step into the shoes of the person and take over whatever right he may have against third parties. But, it is found that the insurers are not always successful in their subrogation claims against the wrongdoer in the construction industry. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature <b>of</b> right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> against co-insured and the waiver <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> clauses in the standard <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all related third parties. This would lead to the insurers not being able to exercise the usual rights <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> against any <b>of</b> the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> clauses. The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from the party at fault. So, where a loss has been caused by a subcontractor and the principal contractor seeked recovery, the insurer cannot pursue the claim from the subcontractor...|$|R
40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> The doctrine <b>of</b> marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> <b>of</b> a surety who discharges the principal debtor 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> <b>of</b> a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any right to be subrogated to the (former) right of the payee against the debtor...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 5614 This thesis {{attempts}} {{a thorough}} {{review of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> as applied in Ireland and England, {{with reference to the}} law of other common law jurisdictions and to the views of certain civil law writers. It first introduces the topic and then considers the juridical basis <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> It also attempts to sketch the historical origins and derivation of the modern law <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> Subrogation is generally divided into two categories by civilian and American writers, namely legal subrogation and contractual subrogation. Irish and English courts have not always been careful to make it clear which category they were applying. This has led to considerable confusion and controversy as to the relevance <b>of</b> intention to <b>subrogation.</b> Some authors have laid down the broad proposition that subrogation is a remedy to reverse unjust enrichment and nothing more. This thesis disputes the universal application of the ?restitutionary hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|Insurance law recognizes some principles; one <b>of</b> them is <b>subrogation</b> principle. The {{explanation}} of the principle {{is seen in the}} article of 284 Wetboek Van Koophandel (WvK), in which, through the principle, a guarantor can replace the position of an endured person. Subrogation can only be done by the insurance company as a guarantor under condition if the third party has their own obligation to give a claim loss to the endured party. Therefore, this research is done to explain how far the scope <b>of</b> the <b>subrogation</b> principle if there is an evenement to the third party, which particularly happened in the Asuransi Ramayana Company in Jakarta. The research method used in this field is the empirical law research. It is a law research that focuses on the society behavior (law in action) which is done directly to the informants that is used as the primary data. In the implementation process <b>of</b> this <b>subrogation</b> principle, the right of claim will move to the guarantor when the claim losss have already approved by the endured party and then the guarantor will execute the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> by doing mediation or sending a lawsuit to the court. However, it can be seen later in this research whether the guarantor's taking steps will gain profit or loss. Therefore in these rights, the guarantor should explain the scope <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> principle if there is an evenement occurs in a certain condition and the endured party is also able to give a clear identity to the third party in order to gain a good condition in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> principle...|$|R

50|$|In Commercial Union v Lotter, {{the buyer}} of a luxury motor vehicle did not {{disclose}} to the insurer that the vehicle had been stolen from another country. When the vehicle was stolen again, the insurance company repudiated the claim. The court upheld the company's repudiation {{on the basis that}} material facts had not been disclosed. The insurance company argued that its right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> was diminished {{by the fact that the}} vehicle in question was a stolen vehicle when the insurance policy was taken out: The insured had no title to the vehicle, so the insurance company could not sue a negligent third party, in terms of its right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation,</b> for the full costs of repairing any damage to the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In Commercial Union v Lotter, {{the court}} held that the fact that the insured vehicle was a stolen vehicle {{compromised}} the appellant's right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> Having satisfied the claim of the insured, the insurer was entitled to be placed in the insured's position in respect of all rights and remedies against other parties which were vested in the insured in relation to the subject-matter of the insurance. In a case such as the present, however, where the insured vehicle was a stolen one, an action instituted by Commercial Union (against a negligent third party who had damaged the vehicle) could be successfully resisted on the basis that Lotter (and thus Commercial Union under its right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation)</b> had no title in the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper briefly {{introduces}} a {{recent history of}} the development of the Chinese contract law. It then analyses various specific contract law issues including formation of the contract, liability for breach of contract and the notion <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> This paper finds that PRC’s contract law presents a hybrid version with key concepts from both Common law tradition and the Civil law tradition. This hybrid is however unique in the way of enforcing contracting parties’ rights/obligations in many contract matters. Unfortunately, without a proper case recording system in the jurisdiction, the unique Chinese legal method is somehow difficult to solve complex contract issues. This paper then argues further {{that there is a need}} to update the current system in the law of contract, particular in dealing with the right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar rules {{apply to}} {{transfers}} of contractual rights by way <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> [...] Whether {{or not a}} right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> arises {{as a matter of}} law depends upon the applicable law between the parties between whom the subrogation operates, and not the contract in relation to which the rights are subrogated. [...] So, for example: Mr X deposits property with Mr Y under a contract of bailment governed by German law, and during that period that property is damaged. Mr X claims under his policy of insurance governed by English lqw with Z Co, who pays the claim. It will be a matter of English law whether Z Co is subrogated to any right of action which Mr X might have had against Mr Y under the original contract of bailment.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{insurance}} {{began to spread}} since the Eighteen century due to its importance in our daily, economic and social life. Its own principles began to be adopted till it has became a law. One of these principles is the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> By this doctrine the insurance company {{is being able to}} subrogate the insured by suing the third party who actually caused the damage insured against. This research contains three chapters in addition to the introduction and the conclusion.

A number of recent decisions have contemplated or recognised a right <b>of</b> equitable <b>subrogation</b> available to secured creditors whose security has been diminished by the application of ss 433 or 561. However, it remains unclear whether ss 433 and 561 impose trust obligations and whether a breach of a trust obligation is necessary for equitable subrogation to be available.

5000|$|Subrogation {{is a legal}} {{doctrine}} whereby {{one person}} is entitled to enforce the subsisting or revived rights of another for one's own benefit. A right <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> typically arises by operation of law, but can also arise by statute or by agreement.

50|$|Outside {{of these}} {{categories}} exist a range of doctrines which also provide restitutionary or analogous remedies. Academic commentators have sought to rationalise these in terms of unjust enrichment, with various degrees of success.

Certain statutory frameworks providing for restitutionary remedies have been said to rest on the principle of unjust enrichment.|$|R

40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{was enacted}} in 1974 {{to protect the}} pension rights of {{employees}} nationwide. However, due to its broad preemptive powers, ERISA has since developed into a tool used by health insurers to recover {{millions of dollars in}} tort damages meant to benefit employees with ERISA health plans. This practice, known as subrogation, has been met with legislative backlash in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> state antisubrogation statutes, which attempt to limit the enforceability <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> clauses found in almost all ERISA health plans. However, many courts have held that ERISA preempts these antisubrogation statutes, thereby affirming insurers’ ability to recover funds intended to compensate injured victims. These decisions often have disastrous and life changing consequences for injured employees. After examining ERISA’s preemptive clauses and the Supreme Court cases delineating their limits, this Note argues that state antisubrogation statutes should be upheld against preemption challenges. This result is necessary to preserve ERISA’s original purpose: protection of employees nationwide...|$|R
