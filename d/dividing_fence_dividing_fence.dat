John Keleher carried out the timber structures and joinery. The roof was originally shingled. It was completed by the end of March 1875 and was known as the Warwick Central School, the Warwick National School being renamed the Warwick East School.

30|$|According {{to local}} expert {{interviews}} small livestock farmers are considered those with farm size less than 20 hectares, while big-scale producers are considered {{those with more}} than 400 hectares. According to official cattle vaccination data in the Municipality of Cachoeiras de Macacu in 2011, an estimation of the herd size can be given {{on the base of}} vaccinated animals. This resulted in 27, 995 animals in all three districts of this Municipality (Secretary of Agriculture, Cattle Farming, Fisheries and Supply [2011]). Most livestock farmers (90 %) have less than 500 animals and small-scale producers are considered in this municipality those with less than 20 animals. Mostly, animals are distributed in paddocks without <b>dividing</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|R

Instead of holding hands, people can just barely touch the tips of their fingers through openings in the steel wire.|$|R

50|$|When first established, a picket <b>fence</b> <b>divided</b> {{the park}} from the roadway. By 1924, {{that section of}} the timber fence {{opposite}} Queen's Hotel, near the intersection of Wickham Street and The Strand, had been replaced with park entrance gates and fencing of wrought-iron panels set between masonry pillars. Also by 1924, several canon, probably trophies from the 1914-18 war, were located east and west of the bandstand; the park was lit by gas lamps; and a children's playground had been constructed at {{the western end of}} the park, near the sea baths. No evidence of this early playground survives.|$|R
