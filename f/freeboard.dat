5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} {{seakeeping}} of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the Connecticut class with their higher <b>freeboard,</b> carried their secondary armament {{too close to}} the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing <b>freeboard</b> and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in <b>freeboard,</b> reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
50|$|They {{are mostly}} used on <b>freeboards</b> and longboards without a kicktail.|$|R

50|$|Longboarding (1970s) : Similar to <b>freeboarding</b> {{but with}} long skateboards {{that come in}} {{different}} shapes and sizes, longboarding is mostly a racing sport {{but there are many}} other styles as well.|$|R
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low <b>freeboard</b> meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more <b>freeboard</b> by the {{addition}} of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} fitted with three {{temporary}} masts for their delivery voyages, although only Cerberus had her <b>freeboard</b> raised {{with the addition}} of temporary bulwarks. The ships spent the bulk of their service lives in reserve and rarely, if ever, left their home port. Magdala was sold in January 1903, but Cerberus was hulked in 1900 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when it was formed in 1911. She was renamed HMAS Platypus II in 1918 and sold in 1924. Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a breakwater, and her remains are still visible today.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hotspur was {{inspired}} by a series of French coast-defence ships with the ram as their primary weapon. The layout of Glatton was modified with a fixed turret and her <b>freeboard</b> was increased over that of the older ship. The single 12-inch gun was mounted on a turntable and could pivot at each gun port to maximise its arc of fire. It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5000|$|The first 19th century loading {{recommendations}} were introduced by Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping in 1835, following discussions among shipowners, shippers and underwriters. Lloyds recommended <b>freeboards</b> {{as a function}} of the depth of the hold (three inches per foot of depth). These recommendations, used extensively until 1880, became known as [...] "Lloyd's Rule".|$|R
50|$|This {{last class}} of {{monitors}} {{had been designed}} and built because of public demand for coastal defense before the Spanish-American War. By {{the time they were}} built and commissioned their purpose had passed. They didnt fit into the Navys new purpose and so they bounced around from different assignments to another. Arkansas and her sisters were refitted as submarine tenders in 1913 because of their low <b>freeboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the cabin}} {{interiors}} are designed to flexy-space principles, the concept being multi-purpose space on a human scale, in which less is more and the simpler the construction, the better. The slim v-shaped hulls {{have a very good}} speed/length ratio and all have canoe sterns, giving minimum drag, even when loaded. This hullshape requires no keels or boards to sail to windward, giving hulls with little draft and easy beachability. Wharram also keeps <b>freeboards</b> low for minimum windage.|$|R
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough <b>freeboard</b> under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low <b>freeboard</b> of the older ships to make her a smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low <b>freeboard,</b> shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, the British Government {{had passed}} few laws about safety at sea. The Merchant Shipping Act made the Plimsoll line or load line {{compulsory}} in 1876, {{but it was not until}} 1894 that the positioning of the mark was fixed in law. It was the Lloyds Register (the insurance institution) who in 1835 originally recommended <b>freeboards</b> as a function of the depth of the hold (three inches per foot of depth, equivalent to 25 cm/m).|$|R
50|$|Skerry cruisers (or Square metre yachts) are yachts, usually wooden, {{which are}} {{constructed}} {{according to the}} Square metre rule. Originating from Sweden, they were historically most popular in the Baltic Sea, though some classes also saw popularity in other European countries and USA. Skerry cruisers are construction classes, meaning that though the boats are not identical with each other, they are all built according to same formula, making them broadly comparable in size and performance. Most skerry cruisers are slender boats, with low <b>freeboards</b> and tall rigs.|$|R
25|$|The {{passenger}} accommodations were {{generous and}} spacious, and the cabins and saloons were elaborately decorated. The ship could initially accommodate 200 first-class passengers; in 1851, accommodations {{for an additional}} 80 second-class passengers were added. Customer service innovations on the Collins Line ships included steam heating in the passenger berths, a barber's shop, and a French maitre de cuisine. The ships' high <b>freeboards</b> and straight stems also contributed to passenger comfort by providing added protection from seaspray and a steadier motion through the waves than typical passenger ships of the period.|$|R
5|$|Thunderer, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was laid down on 26 June 1869 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales. Construction was {{subsequently}} halted for a time in 1871 to modify the ship to improve her stability and buoyancy by extending the breastwork to cover the full width of the hull which increased the ship's <b>freeboard</b> amidships and provided additional accommodation for the crew. The ship was launched on 25 March 1872 by Mrs. Mary Meyrick, wife of Thomas Meyrick, MP. Two years later she was transferred to Portsmouth Dockyard to finish fitting out.|$|E
5|$|While {{the design}} of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low <b>freeboard</b> and heavy turret made her highly {{unseaworthy}} in rough waters. Under the command of John P. Bankhead, Monitor put to sea on 31 December, under tow from , as a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost <b>freeboard</b> (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
25|$|Oars {{mounted on}} the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders, which were used from antiquity {{until the end of the}} Middle Ages in Europe. As the size of ships and the height of the <b>freeboards</b> increased, quarter-rudders became {{unwieldy}} and were replaced by the more sturdy stern-mounted rudders with pintle and gudgeon attachment. While stern-mounted rudders were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times, including light war galleys in Mediterranean, the oldest known depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder can be found on church carvings of Zedelgem and Winchester dating to around 1180.|$|R
5000|$|The Medina {{class were}} a {{development}} of the Rendel (or [...] "flat-iron") gunboat, {{a series of small}} vessels with low <b>freeboards</b> which mounted a small number of relatively large guns. Although the Medinas were exceptionally provided with masts to extend their range and independence, in essence they were available for similar operations to their un-masted sisters; offensive action against shore defences. Their ungainly appearance led them to be described by the naval historian Antony Preston as [...] "the most grotesque craft ever seen". [...] All 12 vessels of the class were named after rivers. They were constructed entirely of iron and were fitted with an unusual bow rudder.|$|R
2500|$|There {{was some}} initial {{resistance}} to the MAC concept, in particular through concerns about operating aircraft from short, relatively slow ships. [...] The Admiralty considered that a flight deck length of [...] was needed for safe take-offs and landings and a speed of 15kn. to provide a sufficient margin over convoy speeds and they were especially doubtful that tankers, with their low <b>freeboards</b> and volatile cargoes, could be utilised. [...] As the U-boat situation worsened, however, such concerns were out-weighed by the urgent need to provide convoy air support, and once it was accepted that the grain ship variant at least {{could be made to}} work, the Admiralty became more enthusiastic about the project.|$|R
5|$|Kilkis {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} upgrades in 19261928 but was already obsolete due to low speed and low <b>freeboard.</b> The ship had her boilers re-tubed during this refit. On 29 November 1929, the Hellenic Navy announced that Kilkis would be withdrawn from service and broken up for scrap. Consequently, in 1930, Georgios Averof replaced {{her as the}} fleet flagship. Nevertheless, Kilkis remained in service with the fleet until 1932. The ship was then withdrawn from the active fleet and used as a training ship. A failed insurrection in the Greek fleet in March 1935 led {{to a reduction in}} the number of personnel in the Navy. As a result, Kilkis and Georgios Averof were removed from active service. After the revolt, Kilkis was used as a training ship for anti-aircraft gunners.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, at first aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Italias were the second {{class of the}} programme, which also included the , designed in the mid-1870s by Insp Eng Benedetto Brin. The ships were authorized in 1875, with funding allocated to begin construction the following year. They were faster and more seaworthy than the preceding Caio Duilio class, owing to their higher <b>freeboard.</b> Brin intended them {{to be capable of}} fighting successfully against any foreign warship in service, and so he opted for very large guns for the main battery.|$|E
5|$|The Hawkins-class cruiser was {{designed}} to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high <b>freeboard</b> {{to allow it to}} maintain its speed in heavy weather. Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.|$|E
5000|$|The Medina {{class were}} a {{development}} of the Rendel (or [...] "flat-iron") gunboat, {{a series of small}} vessels with low <b>freeboards</b> which mounted a small number of relatively large guns. Although the Medinas were exceptionally provided with masts to extend their range and independence, in essence they were available for similar operations to their un-masted sisters; offensive action against shore defences.

[...] All 12 vessels of the class were built at Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company in Jarrow and were named after rivers. They were constructed entirely of iron and were fitted with an unusual bow rudder.|$|R
5000|$|The three largest ships [...] the Naja Arctica (782 TEU), Nuka Arctica (782 TEU), and Mary Arctica (588 TEU) [...] are principally {{used for}} the Aalborg route. The Irena Arctica (424 TEU), Arina Arctica (283 TEU), and Pajuttaat are used within Greenland and have {{equipment}} for unloading in cities without harbors. All these container ships are double-hauled and built with high <b>freeboards</b> and the highest ice ratings: the Mary Arctica has even been chartered for Antarctic service. The settlement ships Angaju Ittuk, Anguteq Ittuk, Aqqaluk Ittuk, and Johanna Kristina are all older and smaller (220 - 320 m³) and used for supplying the smaller ports. In 2011, the ships had an average on-time rate of 72%.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was some}} initial {{resistance}} to the MAC concept, in particular through concerns about operating aircraft from short, relatively slow ships. The Admiralty considered that a flight deck length of 460 ft. was needed for safe take-offs and landings and a speed of 15 kn. to provide a sufficient margin over convoy speeds and they were especially doubtful that tankers, with their low <b>freeboards</b> and volatile cargoes, could be utilised. [...] As the U-boat situation worsened, however, such concerns were out-weighed by the urgent need to provide convoy air support, and once it was accepted that the grain ship variant at least {{could be made to}} work, the Admiralty became more enthusiastic about the project.|$|R
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured <b>freeboard</b> of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough <b>freeboard</b> to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|In October 1908, the Artillery Committee met to {{make its}} {{recommendations}} to the Junta Superior. The Committee concluded the SECN and Schneider proposals were superior to the Ansaldo version, but neither had a marked advantage over the other. The following month, the Naval Construction Committee met to evaluate the proposals. It recommended the SECN design first, followed by Schneider, with Ansaldo last. The Office of the Navy Controller also evaluated the proposals in November, and advised the Junta Superior that only the SECN bid met the design requirements without any legal, administrative, or cost problems. In February 1909, the Navy requested a revised design from SECN to incorporate several alterations, including an increased <b>freeboard</b> to improve seakeeping, an increased height and length of the main belt armor, {{and the addition of}} individual rangefinders for each gun turret. SECN agreed to make the changes on 20 March, and the company received the contract on 14 April. Due to the constraints imposed by the Spanish economy, the resulting design produced the smallest dreadnought-type battleships ever built. They were also obsolescent before completion due to rapid technological changemost significantly the rise of the superdreadnought battleshipsand lengthy delays in completion of the later units of the class.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new empirical relation for the shape {{factor in the}} Weibull distribution that describes the distribution of overtopping wave volumes. This improvement increases the applicable range of the Weibull distribution from very low average overtopping discharges to large discharges resulting from combined wave overtopping and steady surge overflow at negative <b>freeboards.</b> The effect this improvement has on wave overtopping simulation is also discussed. Measured maximum flow thicknesses, velocities, and discharges from experiments of combined wave and surge overtopping are examined {{to learn more about}} the variability of these key parameters as a function of individual overtopping wave volumes. A key finding is that wave volumes containing the 2 %-exceedance value of maximum velocity typically have maximum flow thicknesses well below the 2 %-exceedance level, and vice-versa. Furthermore, the 2 %-exceedance hydrodynamic parameters do not occur in the 2 %-exceedance wave volumes. Finally, empirical relationships are developed for several parameters that showed strong trends...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a series of experiments on a simplified model of a 160 m RO-RO ferry, after SOLAS damage. The model was a prismatic shape, primarily to allow for a direct comparison with numerical simulations. The model was tested for a range of residual <b>freeboards</b> from 0. 5 to 1. 5 metres, and a vertical centre of gravity range to cover values expected from typical existing ships and ships designed to meet SOLAS 90 regulations. The model was tested with and without a centreline casing and {{for a wide range of}} freeing port areas. Some tests were carried out with flapped covers on the freeing ports, to prevent water flowing onto the deck through the freeing ports, and some tests were carried out with permanently open freeing ports. For each condition, the highest waveheight that the model could survive and lowest waveheight that caused a capsize were determined. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
