[...] The first phase consists of the initiating the utilization {{of the internet and}} <b>electronic</b> <b>tools</b> and resources to enable such things as web-based payment. [...] The second phase consists of mass infusion of digital utilization such that citizens are enabled to routinely obtain presentation, reviews, and make government payments online as well as have open access to government information such as city council minutes and/or news on newly enacted legislation or public notices. [...] The third phase consists of citizen customization where ideas become intertwined in discussion over whether the structure of government institutions is and/or should persist to be fundamentally hierarchical or can be better modeled by a simple hub-and-spoke sort of complex social network.|$|E

40|$|Background. Current patient {{education}} and informed consent regarding weight loss expectations for bariatric surgery candidates are {{largely based on}} averages from large patient cohorts. The variation in weight loss outcomes illustrates the need for establishing more realistic weight loss goals for individual patients. This {{study was designed to}} develop a simple web-based tool which provides patient-specific weight loss expectations. Methods. Postoperative weight measurements after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were collected and analyzed with patient characteristics known to influence weight loss outcomes. Quantile regression was used to create expected weight loss curves (25 th, 50 th, and 75 th %tile) for the 24 months after RYGB. The resulting equations were validated and used to develop web-based tool for predicting weight loss outcomes. Results. Weight loss data from 2986 patients (2608 in the primary cohort and 378 in the validation cohort) were included. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) and age were found to have a high correlation with weight loss accomplishment (P< 0. 0001 for each). An <b>electronic</b> <b>tool</b> was created that provides easy access to patient-specific, 24 -month weight loss trajectories based on initial BMI and age. Conclusions. This validated, patient-centered <b>electronic</b> <b>tool</b> will assist patients and providers in patient teaching, informed consent, and postoperative weight loss management...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a study {{that focuses on the}} {{vocational}} education and train-ing (VET) system in Norway and the part of the training undertaken in training es-tablishments. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the use of an <b>electronic</b> monitoring <b>tool</b> improves the apprentices’ learning- and work habits as well as their professional awareness. The study is twofold. Firstly, we used a quantitative design to illuminate the phe-nomenon of ‘volition’, as an expression of learning and work habits. In this part of the study 64 apprentices answered a questionnaire. Secondly, we conducted a quali-tative study in which three apprentices were interviewed about their experiences with the <b>electronic</b> monitoring <b>tool</b> and what it entails in terms of their learning and work habits, as well as their professional awareness. Findings indicate that the <b>electronic</b> monitoring <b>tool</b> helps to reinforce communi-cation between the apprentices and instructors. In addition, findings indicate that apprentices reflection and effort increases, which can be an important contribution to appropriate learning and work habits. In sum, our findings suggest that an <b>electronic</b> monitoring <b>tool</b> appears to con-tribute positively to both appropriate learning and work habits, as well as manage-ment of apprentices’ understanding of their future professional responsibilities...|$|R
