5|$|The {{foundation}} is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division. The foundation supports {{the use of}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the {{foundation is}} supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{routinely}} advocate sex-positive {{feminism and}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food. They also have protested against wars and the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|For {{multicellular}} organisms, {{typically the}} embryo is engineered which grows into the adult <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organism. However, the genomes of cells {{in an adult}} organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{a villain}} is <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> super bugs to destroy all worlds.|$|R
50|$|There are strict {{regulations}} and protocols {{that go along}} with <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> plants. A company that specializes in producing <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> organisms must put their plants through a huge variety of tests {{to ensure the safety of}} their product. Each of these tests must be passed by the product in order to produce more of the plant seeds.|$|R
50|$|B&W {{was also}} {{involved}} in <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> tobacco (notably the controversial Y1 strain).|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Raëlism, members of the Raëlian Church have toured public {{settings}} advocating masturbation, condoms and birth control. Raëlians hope that <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food and nanotechnology will allow humankind to eliminate the obligation to work, {{in a world that}} embraces science and technology.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is now a}} routine research tool with model organisms. For example, genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function. Many organisms have been <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> for applications in agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied. Another new application of genetic technology {{is the ability to}} produce <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{scientists}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> {{a transparent}} zebrafish specimen {{to produce a}} visible glow during periods of intense brain activity, allowing the fish's [...] "thoughts" [...] to be recorded as specific regions of its brain light up in response to external stimuli.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{interesting}} technical issue raised by this book concerns genetic engineering. The Allegon, Berregon, Gonnegon and Qattagon {{appear to be}} the result of genetic engineering, four specialized variations of the original species, rationally designed so as to form a stable social system. On Earth, humans now have the technology for <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> our own species. We are also starting to explore space and confronting the problem of how to deal with the changes that come with science and technology. Is any human-like species biologically suited for dealing with the challenges of science, technology and space exploration? Is it inevitable that in order to survive its [...] "technological adolescence", any species must get involved with <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> itself? ...|$|R
30|$|The current {{observations}} {{show the}} value of <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> human bone marrow aspirates upon mechanical stimulation by rAAV sox 9 as a promising strategy for future treatments to improve cartilage repair by implantation in lesions where the tissue is submitted to natural mechanical forces.|$|R
5|$|In October 2012, the {{government}} passed a Law of Mother Earth that banned <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms (GMOs) being grown in Bolivia; although praised by environmentalists, it was criticised by the nation's soya growers, {{who claimed that}} it would make them less competitive on the global market.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{advances}} in genetic engineering led to developments in crops. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops introduce new traits to plants {{which they do}} not have naturally. These can bring benefits such as a decrease in the use of harmful pesticides, by building in qualities such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The {{data were}} {{published}} as {{a letter in}} The Lancet in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported {{significant differences in the}} thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.|$|E
50|$|The {{microorganisms}} {{that are}} evolved with Evolugate's technology are done so through natural selection, and therefore are enhanced without <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> their composition. This {{allows for the}} microorganism to exist without being labelled as a GMO, and therefore circumvents issues related to food and feed regulations.|$|R
25|$|Policy {{regulations}} for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> human embryos by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos {{were to be}} destroyed after seven days.|$|R
50|$|In October, Chinese {{scientists}} {{reported they}} had started a trial to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> T-cells from 10 adult patients with lung cancer and reinject the modified T-cells back into their bodies to attack the cancer cells. The T-cells had the PD-1 protein (which stops or slows the immune response) removed using CRISPR-Cas9.|$|R
5|$|With {{regards to}} vector control, {{a number of}} novel methods {{have been used to}} reduce {{mosquito}} numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae. There are also trials with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> male A.aegypti that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|After a bad {{experience}} with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food, Marge decides to plant her own garden. Crows arrive on the new garden, so Marge makes a scarecrow, which scares Homer. Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns on them and they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.|$|E
5000|$|Oryza sativa, {{commonly}} known as Asian rice, is the plant species most commonly referred to in English as rice. Oryza sativa is a grass with a genome consisting of 430Mb across 12 chromosomes. It is renowned for being easy to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify,</b> and is a model organism for cereal biology.|$|R
2500|$|In October, Chinese {{scientists}} {{reported they}} had started a trial to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> T-cells from 10 adult patients with lung cancer and reinject the modified T-cells back into their bodies to attack the cancer cells. [...] The T-cells had the PD-1 protein (which stops or slows the immune response) removed using CRISPR-Cas9.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Keshavjee’s {{research}} team focuses its main {{efforts on the}} role of gene therapy in lung transplantation. They are currently developing techniques for <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> the donor lung so it can withstand stress during the transplant process. Ultimately, these techniques would be used to address both ischemia reperfusion injury and obliterative bronchiolitis.|$|R
5|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for just under 1% of GDP, yet the United States is the world's top producer {{of corn and}} soybeans. The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{understanding}} of genetics and the techniques available for modifying DNA allow scientists to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> proteins to also carry a fluorescent protein reporter. In biological samples this allows a scientist to directly make a protein of interest fluorescent. The protein location {{can then be}} directly tracked, including in live cells.|$|R

50|$|In genetics, {{gene drive}} is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} inheritance of a particular gene or set of genes is favorably biased. Gene drive can arise {{through a variety of}} mechanisms and results in its prevalence increasing in a population. Engineered gene drives have been proposed to provide an effective means of <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> populations or even whole species.|$|R
5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> soybeans {{that were}} resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed. Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds {{for more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens in}} Dr. Connors's laboratory, where Connors {{demonstrates}} to his interns Peter and Gwen a new {{potential source of}} clean energy: <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> eels. After Gwen and Peter leave, an electrician, Max Dillon, attempts to upgrade the lab's electrical filters, but gets electrocuted and {{is sent to the}} hospital. There, he is found to be emitting strong electrical fields and is placed in quarantine. Max is further angered when a doctor explains that, although he is stable, he must wear a special suit to contain this emitted bioelectricity.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2014 some 1000 {{research}} papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR. The technology {{had been used to}} functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to <b>genetically</b> <b>modify</b> crop strains. CRISPR {{can also be used to}} change mosquitos so they cannot transmit diseases such as malaria.|$|R
2500|$|Studies {{conducted}} in mice demonstrate that removing either IL-23 or IL-17 decreases {{the progression of}} psoriasis. [...] Mice injected with monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-17 blocked, or neutralized, down stream signaling of this cytokine and decreased epidermal hyperplasia. Similarly, <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> mice to not express IL-23 or IL-17 receptors significantly reduced psoriatic lesion development upon stimulation with the lesion-causing tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.|$|R
50|$|After success {{harvesting}} T {{cells from}} tumors, expanding {{them in the}} lab and reinfusing them into patients reduced tumors, in 2010, Steven Rosenberg announced chimeric antigen receptor therapy, or CAR therapy. This technique is a personalized treatment that involves <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> each patient's T cells to target tumor cells. It produced complete remission in a majority of leukemia patients, although some later relapsed.|$|R
