The arbitrariness of the fundamental domain allows for a choice which obeys all the symmetries of the lattice, which is important <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> tilings with a given non-trivial point-group symmetry in Fourier space.

5|$|Due to such {{regulations}} and law codes, no church was ever {{constructed in the}} history of the Republic of Turkey.

5|$|A Baptist {{congregation}} {{was gathering}} {{at the site}} of the present-day church by at least 1756. Primitive Baptist minister John Monroe (1750–1824) is credited for establishing a place of worship at this site; he is interred in the church's cemetery. The land on which Capon Chapel was built originally belonged to William C. Nixon (1789–1869), a member of the Virginia House of Delegates; later, it was transferred to the Pugh family. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated the land to three trustees <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church and cemetery.|$|E

5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received {{by the people of}} the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began pushing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Busch Stadium {{as part of}} a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building.

According to an {{agreement}} in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off {{the north end of the}} Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
