The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped.

[...] Still, she was shocked to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> agent two months later that Murphy had done so.

2500|$|Cotten {{was born}} in 1893 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to a musical family. Her parents were George Nevill (also spelled Nevills) and Louisa (or Louise) Price Nevill. Elizabeth was the {{youngest}} of five children. At age seven, she began to play her older brother's banjo. By the age of eight, she was playing songs. At the age of 11, after scraping together some money as a domestic helper, she bought her own guitar. The guitar, a Sears and Roebuck brand instrument, cost $3.75. Although self-taught, she became proficient at playing the instrument. By her early teens she was writing her own songs, one of which, [...] "Freight Train", became one of her most recognized. She wrote the song in remembrance of a nearby train that she could <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> childhood home. The 1956 UK recording of the song by Chas. McDevitt and Nancy Whiskey was a major hit and is credited as one of the main influences on the rise of skiffle in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Some saw {{the case}} as a vindication of the UK's strict libel laws. Others noted that Justice Gray [...] "indicated {{that he did not}} 'regard it as being a part' of his {{function}} 'as the trial judge to make findings of fact as to what did and what did not occur during the Nazi regime in Germany', but he then spent hundreds of pages arguing about his position on such issues," [...] claiming that it was the overly-strict libel laws that forced a judge to determine historical fact. A minority of reporters who covered the case were either sympathetic to Irving (for his general career, not for his denial) or non-fans of Lipstadt (one reporter called her boring and said people would not want to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> when the trial was concluded); in his book on the trial, Richard C. Evans noted that some articles assumed that Lipstadt was suing Irving even though the plaintiff's name appears first in the court filing and they could have figured this out, and also that Lipstadt was accused of [...] "trying to silence" [...] Irving by launching a defense against Irving's own lawsuit (a lawsuit that would have ended in Lipstadt being silenced in the UK by having her book removed from circulation if Irving had won the case).|$|E
