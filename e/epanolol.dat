40|$|The {{effects of}} a 21 {{infusion}} of isotonic sodium chloride on renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion were measured in nine normotensive volunteers. Changes in these responses to volume expansion induced by cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade by drugs with (<b>epanolol)</b> and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (atenolol) were examined. Renal plasma flow was significantly lower before, during and after sodium chloride infusion whilst on treatment with atenolol compared with <b>epanolol.</b> Urinary sodium excretion was lower on atenolol than <b>epanolol.</b> Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged by either drug. Basal urinary kallikrein excretion was diminished by atenolol and both <b>epanolol</b> and atenolol inhibited the rise in urinary kallikrein excretion after sodium chloride infusion. Although some of these findings {{may be due to}} a more potent hypotensive effect of atenolol, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may contribute to the apparent protective effects of <b>epanolol</b> on renal function...|$|E
40|$|Eight diabetics with {{autonomic}} neuropathy {{were given}} single oral doses of <b>epanolol</b> (200 mg), atenolol (50 mg), pindolol (5 mg) and placebo in a double-blind randomised order at weekly intervals. Supine resting heart rate, physiological tremor and blood glucose were measured before, 2 and 4 h after dosing, and ambulatory heart rate monitored for 24 h. Supine resting heart rate was significantly lowered by atenolol both at 2 and 4 h, and increased on pindolol at 4 h. Heart rate was unaffected by <b>epanolol</b> compared with placebo. Heart rate during the 'waking' period (14. 00 - 23. 00 h) {{was lower than}} placebo after <b>epanolol</b> and atenolol but unaffected by pindolol. During the 'sleeping' period (23. 00 h- 08. 00 h) heart rate was significantly increased by pindolol, lowered with atenolol and unaffected on <b>epanolol.</b> Pindolol significantly increased physiological tremor at 4 h. No differences were seen between <b>epanolol,</b> atenolol and placebo. Plasma glucose was significantly increased by pindolol 2 h after dosing. These results suggest that pindolol probably produces its partial agonist activity at both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors, while the partial agonist activity of <b>epanolol</b> is beta 1 -selective. Despite abnormal cardiovascular reflex tests in these diabetics, the heart rate responses obtained in this study after beta-adrenoceptor blockade were surprisingly normal, and suggest {{that the concept of}} 'cardiac denervation' in diabetes requires modification...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{different}} beta-blockers {{have been}} shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), but the importance of their ancillary properties is not clear. <b>Epanolol</b> is a selective beta(1) -blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, which has been shown useful in angina pectoris, but its value in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and CHF is unknown. We examined the effects of <b>epanolol</b> in patients with LV dysfunction (n = 8; mean LV ejection fraction, 0. 33 +/- 0. 08) and compared them with patients with normal LV function (n = 8; mean LV ejection fraction, 0. 52 +/- 0. 03). Measurement of invasive hemodynamics and neurohormones was performed at rest and during myocardial ischemia, which was induced by atrial pacing. All measurements were performed before and after <b>epanolol.</b> Before <b>epanolol,</b> pacing-induced ischemia led to a similar increase in norepinephrine and coronary sinus blood flow in both groups. After <b>epanolol,</b> the increase in neurohormones was more pronounced in the group with LV dysfunction (norepinephrine, 1, 130 +/- 164 pg/ml for patients with LV dysfunction vs. 637 +/- 41 pg/ml for normal subjects; p < 0. 05). A similar effect was observed for angiotensin II. Further, in the LV-dysfunction group, coronary sinus blood flow increased less, and coronary vascular resistance decreased less (both values, p < 0. 05). Despite the fact that the increase in double product was decreased to a similar extent in both groups, ischemia was reduced only in normal LV function (p < 0. 05). In ischemic LV dysfunction, neurohumoral activation after <b>epanolol</b> may impair adequate coronary flow response, and this may limit its antiischemic propel ties. Because of the small size of the study, no definitive inference on the clinical benefit of <b>epanolol</b> in patients with ischemic LV function can be made from this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>epanolol</b> (200 mg once daily) and {{diltiazem}} (60 mg three times daily) on {{the response of}} atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to exercise were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Exercise tolerance as assessed by peak oxygen consumption was similar with all treatments. Peak heart rate (mean and 95 % confidence intervals) was lower (P < 0. 05) with <b>epanolol</b> (121 (115 - 130) beats min- 1) than with diltiazem (137 (126 - 148) beats min- 1) or placebo (141 (130 - 152) beats min- 1). ANP did not change from resting values with placebo or diltiazem, but rose significantly (P < 0. 05) with <b>epanolol</b> from 19. 7 (13. 0 - 29. 8) pg ml- 1 (geometric mean and 95 % confidence intervals) during supine rest to 49. 6 (33. 7 - 73. 0) pg ml- 1 at peak exercise. Since ANP release is stimulated by atrial distension, patients with untreated angina may stop exercise before atrial dilatation occurs. With beta-adrenoceptor blockade, a reduction in peak heart rate may necessitate increased chamber volumes to maintain cardiac output, accounting for the rise in ANP...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year the}} number of β-blockers on the {{pharmaceutical}} market is increasing, requiring systematization of their standardization methods. Aim of research. The aim of our research is to study literature data about identification and assay methods of β-blockers with different direction of action – selective (praktolol, metoprolol, atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, esmolol, <b>epanolol,</b> esatenolol, nebivolol, Talinolol), non-selective (alprenolol, Oxprenololum, pindolol, propranolol, timolol, sotalol, nadolol, mepindolol, karteol, tertatolol, bopindolol, bupranolol, penbutolol, kloranolol) and combined (labetalol, carvedilol). Methods. The analytical review of literature sources about β-blockers analysis by physical, chemical, and physicochemical methods. Results. After literature sources’ analyzing {{it was found that}} physical and physicochemical constants are basically used for β-blockers pharmacopoeial analysis; both physicochemical values and chemical reactions are used in forensic analysis, resulting in the article. It was founded that titration methods, mostly acid-base titration method, are used for β-blockers assay in the analysis of substances. For β-blockers detection in biological fluids and dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites mixture separation one should prefer physicochemical methods, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, absorption UV-Visible spectroscopy, fluorometry, etc. Conclusion. The results have shown can be used for the further search of the identification and assay optimal methods of β-blockers both pure and mixed with other active substances and excipients</p...|$|E
