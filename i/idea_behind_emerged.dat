40|$|Individual donors coming {{together}} to pool their funds and to make grants, that is the <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> giving circles. <b>Emerging</b> as a new trend in the United States, giving circles are typically organized around a particular issue or area of interest and are considered a high engagement form of philanthropy. The circle's grantmaking functions, proposal review, and site visits engage members in a participatory process that, when combined with the increased impact of pooled charitable resources, has strong appeal to many donors. The Baltimore Giving Project, housed at the Association of Baltimore Area Grantmakers (USA), has supported the growth of many giving circles since 2000. Its report details the growth and lessons learned from two of these circles...|$|R
50|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> The Cosmonaut <b>emerged</b> {{from two}} main sources: a) the conversations between Nicolás Alcalá and Bruno Teixidor (the main {{creative}} minds behind the project’s visual looks) about conspiracies, the Lost Cosmonauts theories and the Soviet space program; and b) the poetry book Poetics for Cosmonauts, written by Henry Pierrot. Throughout {{the time it}} was developed, the main plot core underwent a lot of changes, although some key elements remained through all the process, mainly the principal plot element (the return of an astronaut to Earth after a long trip to the Moon). After the reading of Poetics for Cosmonauts, the script changed to its present form. The preproduction for the short film started in October-November 2008.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{some of the}} <b>ideas</b> <b>behind</b> the <b>emerging</b> {{discipline of}} Web Science, whose ambition is to shape the future development of the World Wide Web and the research agenda that that requires. There are formidable obstacles to this ambition, not least the large scale of the Web, the most complex piece of technology ever devised, and the co-constitution of the Web with its communities of users. Web Science must therefore straddle and integrate computing, mathematics, complexity and network studies on the one hand, together with studies of the social context, using the methods of sociology, law and economics on the other. The chapter defines the Web and differentiates it from the Internet, upon whose infrastructure it depends. Web Science is {{shown to be a}} type of reflective practice, made problematic by its scale and by the complexity of its interrelation with embedding societies; in particular it is difficult to integrate the micro-scale of the protocols which define it, with the macro-scale of the social effects that follow from widespread use of particular systems. The example of the development of the Web of Linked Data is used to illustrate difficulties and potential solutions...|$|R
40|$|Imagine a {{teleconferencing}} system that’s so realistic, so natural, {{that you}} feel you could reach out and shake a participant’s hand, even though the individual may be sitting in a room hundreds or even thousands of miles away. That’s the <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> telepresence, an <b>emerging</b> teleconferencing technology that’s designed to not only connect people together but {{to make them feel}} like they’re all collaborating together inside the same room. Telepresence provides an immersive meeting experience based on the highest possible levels of audio and video clarity. Ideally, participants are life-sized. Ide-ally, every sound, gesture, and facial expression are replicated in high-definition (HD) video and high-fidelity surround sound. The ultimate goal is to make telepresence and in-person meetings virtually indistinguishable from each other. “Telepresence has a great potential for getting people to work together collaboratively, efficiently, and naturally regardless of their physical location,” observes Zhengyou Zhang, a principal researcher focusing on telepresenc...|$|R
