5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

Extremely large pieces {{can take up to}} three years. These trees vary in size from miniatures to gigantic public sculptures. Many trees have unique themes but the most common is the duality of life and death and the relationship of man with the natural world. Most trees are created and sold by artisans who have learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> from their parents and grandparents.|$|E

Thousands of women composed poems [...] "in honour of Akhmatova", mimicking her style and prompting Akhmatova to exclaim: [...] "I taught our women how to speak, but don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> silent". Her aristocratic manners and artistic integrity won her the titles [...] "Queen of the Neva" [...] and [...] "Soul of the Silver Age," [...] as the period came to be known in the history of Russian poetry. [...] In Poem Without a Hero, the longest and one of the best known of her works, written many decades later, she would recall this as a blessed time of her life. [...] She became close friends with Boris Pasternak (who, though married, proposed to her many times) [...] and rumours began to circulate that she was having an affair with influential lyrical poet Alexander Blok. In July 1914, Akhmatova wrote “Frightening times are approaching/ Soon fresh graves will cover the land"; [...] on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia, marking the start of [...] "the dark storm" [...] of world war, civil war, revolution and totalitarian repression for Russia.

2500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps. In the trial version, the player can only select Zeus, but there are nine gods available in the full version of the game. There was debate during Age of Mythologys construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> [...] "fair" [...] while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded {{that the best way to}} make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a [...] "faceless drone in another building".|$|E

2500|$|The {{band and}} their {{creative}} team focused initial meetings {{on what they}} wanted to communicate to the audience and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> feel. After defining the thematic arc of the show, the stage design began to take shape. Devlin explained the creative team's approach in designing the multifaceted stage: [...] "We wanted to respond to the geometry of an arena: all that oval air, how to energize the whole mass of air in those spaces so that the atmosphere reaches everyone in the room equally." [...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on construction drawings. Fisher was unable to physically attend any meetings after the first one, but did occasionally videoconference with the creative team via Skype. In the final meeting he attended before his death in June 2013, when Bono asked the team to think of an object that could symbolise U2 and be incorporated into the stage design, Fisher suggested a cross; the idea would be implemented into some of the stage's lighting fixtures.|$|E

These two parts own their own resources, meaning that there is no reference for behavior of model in structural part and vice versa.

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} an explicit {{form of a}} general integral of motion for some classes of dynamical systems including n-degrees of freedom Euler-Lagrange systems subject to (n - 1) virtual holonomic constraints.
