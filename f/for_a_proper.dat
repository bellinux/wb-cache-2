Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>proper</b> public health response to the virus.

5|$|The private Cloud Club {{formerly}} {{occupied the}} 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>proper</b> restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was {{a compromise between}} William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E

5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>proper</b> identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E

25|$|Rameau {{composed}} prolifically in {{the late}} 1740s and early 1750s. After that, his rate of productivity dropped off, probably due to old age and ill health, although he {{was still able to}} write another comic opera, Les Paladins, in 1760. This was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique, Les Boréades; but for unknown reasons, the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>proper</b> staging.

25|$|In {{order to}} make {{patients}} feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections.

By being available <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>proper</b> amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable psychiatric/mental health nurses to understand the meaning behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attaining a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.|$|E

However, an insight by Los Alamos mathematician Stanislaw Ulam showed that the fission bomb and the fusion fuel could be in separate parts of the bomb, and that radiation of the fission bomb could first work in a way to compress the fusion material before igniting it.|$|E
