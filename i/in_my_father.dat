500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1960 Bennett, {{along with}} Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook, {{achieved}} instant fame by appearing at the Edinburgh Festival in the satirical revue Beyond the Fringe. After the festival, the show continued in London and New York. He also appeared <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> Knew Lloyd George. His highly regarded television comedy sketch series On the Margin (1966) was unfortunately erased; the BBC re-used expensive videotape rather than {{keep it in}} the archives.

2500|$|The {{paternal}} view of God as the Father {{extends beyond}} Jesus to his disciples, {{and the entire}} Church, {{as reflected in the}} petitions Jesus submitted to the Father for his followers {{at the end of the}} Farewell Discourse, the night before his crucifixion. Instances of this in the Farewell Discourse are [...] as Jesus addresses the disciples: [...] "I am <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father,</b> and you in me, and I in you" [...] and in [...] as he prays to the Father: [...] "I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norwegian singer Sondre Lerche covered [...] "Countdown" [...] in December 2011 as a [...] "Christmas gift" [...] and his {{favorite}} {{song of the}} year. He further stated, [...] "I took the liberty of making some gender-oriented changes to the lyrics to better accommodate my macho-persona... That being said, {{the trick is to}} get passed the novelty-factor and just sing a beautiful song at the best of your abilities. Obviously, a significant part of this song's appeal and ecstatic energy comes from the dizzying vocal performance and the mind-blowingly cool production work — elements and talents useless to even attempt replicating (especially not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> in-law's basement). But as long as there's a song underneath, there's a way." [...] His cover of the song contains his vocals and mild acoustic guitar strumming, which according to Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine gives [...] "an approach that puts the focus on the track's stellar songwriting". According to Mallika Rao of The Huffington Post, [...] "Sondre Lerche made us a gift... and probably because he's a talented, popular, professional musician, it's really good". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the cover, saying: [...] "The end result is a simple track, without pomp or circumstance or the crazy marching band, where Lerche is able to replicate not the high-energy feel, but the song's simple message of love and dedication. Thanks to its minimalist nature, the track isn't a corny display of pop mockery, but a demonstration of how universal great music can be." ...|$|E
