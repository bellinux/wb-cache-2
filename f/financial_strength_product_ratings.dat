In turn, a measure of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is built, including indicators of capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity.

Our event history analysis of 119 IJVs formed in Brazil shows that asymmetric <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> increases the likelihood of termination. However, notably, the findings reveal that higher local partner <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is less harmful to IJV performance than lower local partner <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> Moreover, under both conditions, IJV performance is better when the highest equity stake is attributed to the local partner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating {{indicates}} the fundamental <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> of a bank. The aim of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating is to measure a bank’s fundamental <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> excluding the external factors. External factors can {{stem from the}} working environment or can be linked with the outside protective support mechanisms. With the evaluation, the rating of a bank free from outside supportive factors is being sought. Also the financial fundamental, franchise value, the variety of assets and working environment of a bank are being evaluated in this context. In this study, a model has been developed in order to predict the <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating of Turkish banks. The methodology {{of this study is}} as follows: Selecting variables {{to be used in the}} model, creating a data set, choosing the techniques to be used and the evaluation of classification success of the techniques. It is concluded that the artificial neural network system shows a better performance in terms of classification of <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> rating in comparison to multivariate statistical methods in the raining set.

40|$|The initial {{matching}} {{relationships between}} underwriters and bonds/issuing firms and the certification quality of underwriters, {{as determined by}} changes in the issuing firm’s <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> post issue, are the two primary research topics in this dissertation. Based on total underwriter syndicate market share, two distinct categories, low market power (LMP) syndicates and high market power (HMP) syndicates were defined. Firm <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> is examined based on a new factor developed in this research. A comparison of the two underwriting categories, or pools, indicates that the HMP underwriters take on firms of lower initial <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> and additionally, the issuing firms decline more in <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> two years following bond issuance than do firms using LMP underwriters. Notwithstanding these results, the more interesting findings are the relationships within each of these pools. In the LMP pool of underwriters, financially stronger firms used the larger LMPs to underwrite their bonds, while the weaker firms used smaller LMPs. In contrast, among HMP underwriters, the largest HMPs aligned with the firms of relatively lower <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> The relationships in both pools reverse when changes in <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> are examined. Larger LMPs are associated with greater issuing firm financial decline while larger HMPs correlate {{with lower levels of}} decline in firm <b>financial</b> <b>strength.</b> Divergent patterns in initial underwriter-issuer matching and underwriter certification found in this research indicate that there are true differences in the “small” underwriting syndicates as compared to the larger syndicates. These patterns should be considered by both issuing firms and investors as both constituencies contemplate the corporate bond market...|$|R

40|$|Brand {{image is}} {{supposed}} to influence consumers' product evaluations. The goal {{of this study was}} to enlighten this phenomenon. A total of 220 participants rated fictitious but realistic articles from newspapers that have different images: Blick, a popular tabloid newspaper and NZZ, a traditional quality newspaper. Articles were created that appeared as if they were copied from Blick or NZZ but, in fact, both contained the same text. The main hypothesis that <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> would differ as a result of the manipulation of image was confirmed. Participants evaluated the fictitious articles completely differently. As expected, <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> were in line with the related brand images. Also, more salient stimuli elicited stronger image effects. The effect persisted at general as well as detailed product-rating levels. Next to <b>product</b> <b>ratings,</b> image effects also influenced participants' consumption experiences.

40|$|Although {{the quality}} of rating markets has been academically debated for various types of <b>product</b> and credit <b>ratings</b> {{this is not the}} case for {{insurance}} <b>product</b> <b>ratings.</b> This article provides the first empirical investigation of {{the quality of}} insurance <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> with an emphasis on the potential sources of bias that undermine the credibility of ratings. Rating certificates for certain insurance products (e. g., life and disability insurance) were established in the German insurance market after deregulation in 1994. These ratings play a potentially important role by increasing customer awareness of differential product quality, thereby encouraging more optimal insurance purchases. However, their capacity for enhancing market transparency and improving consumer protection depends critically on whether they are credible. In this paper, we consider potential conflicts of interest and other common agency problems that might lead to systematic bias and imprecision in ratings. Using prior analysis of other rating types as a guide, we test a series of hypotheses regarding factors that may explain the variation in rating outcomes over time and across rating agencies. The empirical analysis employs a unique panel-data set containing rating data for disability insurance products over a fifteen year period. The <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> from two rating agencies are combined with additional financial data on the supplying insurance companies. Our initial results suggest that the market structure and governance of the German market avert major concerns regarding the credibility of insurance <b>product</b> <b>ratings.</b> 2 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to shed light on the consumers’ {{decision}} making processes in an online environment. The vast amount of information found online and the presence of online peer recommendations has shaped the purchase decision making environment – making it more simple in some situations, more complex in others. This study answers to the need for more research on consumers’ cognitive processes when making purchase decisions, the influence of website design factors towards consumer decision making as well as the social presence of others in online environments. Previously little research has been done on the effects of <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> toward consumer attention through eye-tracking methodology. Eye-tracking methodology was chosen to overcome the limitations created by using solely self-report methods and projective techniques, such as surveys and interviews, in order to better understand the mental constructs and the behavior of a consumer. A 2 (decision complexity) X 2 (quality of product rating) between-subjects experiment design was employed for this study to assess whether consumers would try to ease cognitively demanding purchase decision making tasks through the use of social heuristics. The data (N= 25) was collected through assessing the eye movements of multiple subjects. From the data eye-tracking parameters such as fixation duration, dwell time and the time to first fixation were analyzed through statistical tests. Supporting data was collected through asking the subjects for a brief verbalization of their thought process during the experiment. The results show a significant combined effect of task complexity and <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> towards the decision making time. No significant combined effect of task complexity and <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> was found for fixation duration, dwell time and the time to first fixation on the area of interest. A significant main effect was discovered between task complexity and dwell time percentage. Good <b>product</b> <b>ratings</b> were perceived faster than bad <b>product</b> <b>ratings,</b> which as a finding is in line with earlier research. Consumers also seem to be prone to using social heuristics, such as peer-made <b>product</b> <b>ratings,</b> to conform with others during the purchase decision making process, even if the purchase decision is seemingly simple...|$|R
