5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the <b>guitarfishes</b> (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the <b>guitarfishes,</b> but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true <b>guitarfishes</b> of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal bony fishes such as croakers and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two bowmouth <b>guitarfishes</b> examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E
50|$|The banded <b>guitarfish,</b> mottled <b>guitarfish,</b> prickly skate, or striped <b>guitarfish</b> (Zapteryx exasperata) is {{a species}} of fish in the Rhinobatidae family found from shallow water {{to a depth of}} 200 m in the East Pacific from California, United States, to Mazatlan, Mexico, {{including}} the Gulf of California. The species has also been recorded further south (as far as Peru), but this likely involves its close relative, the southern banded <b>guitarfish</b> (Z. xyster).|$|R
50|$|The giant <b>guitarfish</b> was {{previously}} believed to range throughout {{a large part}} of the Indo-Pacific, but recent evidence has shown that it, as traditionally defined, actually was a species complex consisting of four different species. In addition to the giant <b>guitarfish,</b> this complex includes the white-spotted <b>guitarfish,</b> the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish. With these as separate species, the giant <b>guitarfish</b> has a relatively restricted range: It is found only in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and the western Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The {{flathead}} <b>guitarfish</b> or pacific <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos planiceps) is {{a species}} of fish in the Rhinobatidae family. It is found in Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and possibly Nicaragua. Its natural habitats are open seas and shallow seas.|$|R
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, <b>guitarfishes,</b> stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
25|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have confirmed}} the urolophids and related taxa {{belong to the}} order Myliobatiformes; they were once placed in the order Rajiformes with the <b>guitarfishes</b> and skates. Based on morphological characters, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman determined in a 2004 study that the urolophids formed a clade with the giant stingaree (Plesiobatis daviesi), and that the two were basal to a clade containing all other myliobatiform families except Platyrhinidae, Hexatrygonidae, and Zanobatidae. They proposed including Plesiobatis in the family Urolophidae, and classifying the family within the superfamily Urolophoidea within Myliobatiformes.|$|E
500|$|The thornback {{guitarfish}} (Platyrhinoidis triseriata) is {{a species}} of ray in the family Platyrhinidae, and {{the only member of}} its genus. Despite its name and appearance, it is more closely related to stingrays than to true <b>guitarfishes</b> of the family Rhinobatidae. This species ranges from Tomales Bay to the Gulf of California, generally in inshore waters no deeper than [...] It can be found on or buried in sand or mud, or in and near kelp beds. Reaching [...] in length, the thornback guitarfish has a heart-shaped pectoral fin disc and a long, robust tail bearing two posteriorly positioned dorsal fins and a well-developed caudal fin. The most distinctive traits of this plain-colored ray are the three parallel rows of large, hooked thorns that start {{from the middle of the}} back and run onto the tail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guitarfish</b> are a family, Rhinobatidae, of rays. The <b>guitarfish</b> {{are known}} for an {{elongated}} body with a flattened head and trunk and small, ray-like wings. The combined range of the various species is tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species has}} had one {{documented}} {{case of an}} attack on a diver when a male <b>guitarfish</b> was interrupted during mating. Because of the tooth structure of the <b>guitarfish,</b> this attack could have resulted in a [...] "gumming" [...] at worst.|$|R

500|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} (Rhina ancylostoma), {{also called}} the shark ray or mud skate, is a species of ray {{and a member of}} the family Rhinidae. Its evolutionary affinities are not fully resolved, though it may be related to true <b>guitarfishes</b> and skates. This rare species occurs widely in the tropical coastal waters of the western Indo-Pacific, at depths of up to [...] Highly distinctive in appearance, the bowmouth guitarfish has a wide and thick body with a rounded snout and large shark-like dorsal and tail fins. Its mouth forms a W-shaped undulating line, and there are multiple thorny ridges over its head and back. It has a dorsal color pattern of many white spots over a bluish gray to brown background, with a pair of prominent black markings over the pectoral fins. This large species can reach a length of [...] and weight of [...]|$|E
500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and <b>guitarfishes)</b> and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary means}} by which fish {{generate}} thrust is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large tail fin. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from pectoral fins (or front limbs in marine mammals). [...] Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) and batiform fish (electric rays, sawﬁshes, <b>guitarﬁshes,</b> skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed labriform swimming. [...] Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinematics}} {{and muscle}} activity {{pattern of the}} head and jaws during feeding in the Atlantic <b>guitarfish</b> Rhinobatos lentiginosus are described and quantified using high-speed video and electromyography to test hypotheses regarding the conservation and modulation of the feeding mechanism. Prey is captured by the <b>guitarfish</b> using suction. Suction capture, bite manipulation and suction transport behaviors in the <b>guitarfish</b> are similar to one another in the relative sequence of kinematic and motor activity, but can be distinguished from one another by variation in absolute muscle activation time, in {{the presence or absence of}} muscle activity and in the duration of muscle activity. A novel compression transport behavior was observed that is strikingly different from the other feeding behaviors and has not been described previously in elasmobranchs. The mechanism of upper jaw protrusion in the <b>guitarfish</b> differs from that described in other elasmobranchs. Muscle function and motor pattern during feeding are similar in the plesiomorphic cranial muscles in the <b>guitarfish</b> and the spiny dogfish probably because of their shared ancestral morphology. Modulation in recruitment of jaw and hyoid depressor muscles among feeding behaviors in the <b>guitarfish</b> may be a consequence of duplication of muscles and decoupling of the jaws and hyoid apparatus in batoids...|$|R
50|$|The Platyrhinidae are {{a family}} of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, {{commonly}} known as thornbacks due to their dorsal rows of large thorns. They resemble <b>guitarfishes</b> in shape, but are in fact {{more closely related to}} stingrays.|$|E
