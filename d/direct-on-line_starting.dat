This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} there is studied the dynamic regime {{behaviour}} of a reluctance synchronous motor fitted {{out with a}} starting cage. There are analyzed two concrete situations: cage made of aluminium and cage made of copper. There are presented the mathematical model of the motor, the simulation program and the simulations carried out for the two situations. For the case of cage made of aluminium there have been performed experimental tests for <b>direct-on-line</b> no-load <b>starting,</b> tests that confirm the simulations carried out.

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} starting performance and losses at rated operation for a 15 kW, 4 -pole industrial induction motor, mounted with standard skewed, unskewed and unskewed asymmetrical die-cast aluminium rotors through measurements and simulations. It is a well-known fact that rotor skewing suppresses the synchronous torques at low speeds and also reduces the audible noise of the machine. However, the casting process results in a low resistive path between the rotor bars and the iron laminations, for skewed rotors, this promotes the flow of inter-bar currents. These currents, flowing between the rotorbars, increase the harmonic torques during a start and create additional losses at rated operation. For standard unskewed rotors, these losses are ideally zero, but these rotors may produce high audible noise. Studies have shown that rotors with asymmetrical rotor slot pitch can reduce the audible noise level in unskewed machines. By removing the skew, the inter-bar current losses are suppressed to a negligible level; ultimately increased machine efficiency is obtained. In this work the electrical performance is verified through measurements on the built prototypes. <b>Direct-on-line</b> <b>starts</b> and rated performance for motors with different rotor slot arrangements is simulated using 2 D FEM tool FCSmek. The three prototypes are tested in the laboratory according to IEC 60034 - 2 - 1 standard and the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured results. An additional test for the measurement of high frequency delta connected stator winding currents for each prototype machine is also performed, in order to study the losses induced in the stator winding. Results have shown that by introducing the proposed asymmetry in the rotor slots, the synchronous torques at low speeds are suppressed effectively, thus, improving the starting performance of the asymmetrical rotor compared to the standard unskewed rotor. Additionally, a higher pull-out torque is obtained for the unskewed rotor motor compared to the standard skewed rotor motor. However, the losses {{were more or less}} re-distributed in the unskewed rotor motor, resulting in similar efficiency as the standard skewed rotor motor. One important observation is that; to capture the inter-bar current losses which are estimated to be 5. 5 % of the total losses, requires more accurate methods of measurements than the existing. And sufficient repeatability must be achieved; alternatively one should rely on statistical data obtained from measurements on several number of motors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effects of inter-bar currents on inductionmotor starting performance and stray-load losses. The work is focused on theperformance differences between aluminium and copper casted rotors. A method to predict the stator current when <b>starting</b> <b>direct-on-line</b> isdeveloped. This includes modelling of skin-effect, saturation of the leakageflux paths and additional iron losses. The results are verified by measurements. An analytical model accounting for inter-bar currents is derived, andthe dependency of the harmonic rotor currents on the inter-bar resistivity isinvestigated. It is found that the inter-bar currents can have considerableeffect on motor starting performance and stray-load losses, the amount beingstrongly dependent on the harmonic content of the primary MMF. Based on measurements of inter-bar resistivity, the starting performanceof an aluminium and a copper casted rotor is simulated. The results indicatea higher pull-out torque of the aluminium rotor than for the equivalent copperrotor. This is rather due to an increase of the fundamental starting torque ofthe aluminium rotor, than due to braking torques from the space harmonicsin the copper rotor. The results are verified by measurements. It is foundthat the difference between the pull-out torques is even larger than calculatedfrom the model. Thereby, it can be concluded that the inter-bar currents havea considerable effect on motor starting performance. At rated speed the braking torques are larger in the aluminium rotor thanin the copper rotor. This is seen as increased harmonic joule losses in the rotorcage. Simulations have shown, that these losses can be as large as 1 % ofthe output power for the studied machine. QC 2010061...|$|R

The systems of differential equations representing the dynamic state behaviours {{of the machine}} as developed are implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The effects of the stepped sequence of mechanical loading on the motor output variables namely: three-phase stator currents (ia, ib and ic), electromechanical torque and rotor speed, d-q stator and rotor currents (iqs, ids, iqr and idr), d-q voltages (vqs and vds) are examined. The results obtained clearly show the elegance of the d-q axis transformation theory in machine modelling and the inherent limitations of the <b>direct-on-line</b> <b>starting</b> of 3 -hp and 2250 -hp asynchronous motors...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the derivation of an algorithm for the selection of a numerical simulation method for the <b>direct-on-line</b> <b>starting</b> of induction motors from power supplies whose voltage and frequency may vary during the simulation period. A major part of the work consisted of an evaluation of methods for treating the variation of motor parameters under different conditions and the relative effect of these variations on predicted output. Two new methods were introduced for predicting the variation of leakage reactance with current and a new method was developed for deriving the rotor parameter variation with slip for bars of arbitrary, but known, cross-section. An existing method was modified to derive model parameters from manufacturer's quoted performance data. The results are given of an investigation into the effect on the derived parameters and consequently on the predicted performance, of allowing the quoted performance data to vary within the tolerances permitted by Australian Standard 1359. A set of descriptive measures for simulation output were defined. This enabled the motor's starting performance to be quantified in terms of a small number of variables. The factorial method of experimental design was used to calculate relative coefficients of performance. These related the effect of changes in program input data to the resultant variation in program output and thus allowed numerical measures to be placed on the significance of data uncertainty and model complexity as they affected the simulated performance. PC-based data acquisition and processing techniques were used to take measurements from two laboratory motors which confirmed the results of numerical simulation work. The broad general conclusion of the thesis was that in most situations, the total system data needs {{to be included in the}} model if the uncertainty is to be improved beyond that obtainable with simple non-recursive calculations. An expert system shell was used to present an algorithm for the selection of a method of modelling appropriate to the quality of the data, the type of system, the purpose of the study and the availability of computational tools...|$|E
