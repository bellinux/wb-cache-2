5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> in {{a marked}} 71st precinct police {{car on a}} routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> a car from Texas to Florida {{as a favor to}} friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E

He had been beaten over the head, stabbed over 20 times, and his throat had been cut.|$|E
25|$|A Chevrolet lorry was {{purchased}} in 1933 for a {{collection and delivery}} service at Staple, especially for the fruit and vegetable farmers. This was apparently a success, but the service seems to have ceased {{in the early part of}} the Second World War. The Station Agent at Staple used his own lorry after that, but was sacked in 1947 for moonlighting; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> produce to the London markets overnight instead of forwarding it to the railway at Staple.|$|E

The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the final}} race {{at the street}} circuit in Adelaide, Australia Prost was fired from the Ferrari team because he made some scathing {{comments}} about the team and described his car as a 'truck' and the Ferrari team as unwilling {{to work with him}} during a press conference for the Japanese Grand Prix. He was replaced by Ferrari test driver Gianni Morbidelli (who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> for Minardi). Although the Drivers' Championship had already been decided, the Constructors' Championship had not – this was still being disputed by the McLaren and Williams teams.|$|E

25|$|A highly {{successful}} motor racing driver in many disciplines, Dan Gurney <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> in Formula One {{since the late}} 1950s. While driving for the Brabham works team, he joined {{with a group of}} prominent motor racing figures and financial backers in the United States, including Carroll Shelby, to found All American Racers. This effort was largely backed by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, in an effort to challenge Firestone's longtime dominance of American open-wheel racing. Inspired by the performance of Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren's own teams, AAR decided to enter Grand Prix racing. Then as now, the main engineering hub for Formula One manufacturers was in the United Kingdom, so AAR set up a subsidiary team known as Anglo American Racers which, while registered and based in the USA, was named in deference to the cars' British Weslake engines.|$|E
25|$|Raymond was {{considered}} the deadly older brother who was the eldest of all the brothers and had a criminal record stretching back to 1947. Raymond specialized in extortion and was a suspect of hundreds of crimes throughout Montreal but despite his crime and tactics he was rarely convicted. In November 1976, Raymond <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> in his limousine when he was violating traffic laws by going through twelve red lights in a row, when he was pulled over by a police officer and was arrested, he grabbed the officers finger and twisted it until it broke. Raymond faced murder charges in 1974 but was acquitted. Raymond died at his own hand in 1989 when he committed suicide {{at the age of}} 57 and was found in a hotel room surrounded by pills with his wrists slit.|$|E

25|$|The team ran the 1987 HDT VL {{during the}} 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship while the {{evolution}} car was homologated {{and prepared for}} later in the season. In the 1988 ATCC, the Commodore's were really just making up the numbers against the Ford Sierra RS500's and the best Perkins could manage was a 3rd at Sandown (during the season, Perkins had actually been testing {{one of the new}} fuel injected Commodore's and became increasingly frustrated at the delays in debuting the car). Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne, both with long associations with TWR, joined the team for the Sandown 500, with Perkins and Hulme sharing a brand new Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV while Allam and Hahne drove Perkins old VL updated to TWR specs. Hahne, who in 1988 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> a Ford Sierra for Walter Wolf Racing in the European Touring Car Championship and the German DTM series, was a late replacement for Tom Walkinshaw, who was unable to drive as scheduled due to the death of his father. Perkins and Hulme had a strong race at Sandown, finishing second behind the Sierra of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford, while the Allam/Hulme car failed to finish.|$|E
25|$|Italian driver Elio de Angelis who {{had joined}} Brabham after six years with Lotus, was the first driver {{to die in a}} works Brabham when he was killed in an {{accident}} while testing at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France. The car survived the accident relatively intact and de Angelis had only minor injuries. However, there were very few track marshals at the circuit and he was trapped in the car and killed by oxygen deprivation due to a fire before they arrived, prompting a review of testing safety, with changes including more marshals as well as medical staff and a required medical evacuation helicopter. Sadly de Angelis would die from smoke inhalation 29 hours after the crash at the hospital in Marseille where he had been taken. In the Belgian Grand Prix following the death of de Angelis, Brabham only entered one car for Patrese. From the next race in Canada, British driver Derek Warwick joined the team. According to team boss Bernie Ecclestone, Warwick, a former factory Renault driver who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> for the TWR Jaguar World Sportscar Championship team in 1986 after having missed out on a seat at Lotus, was reportedly the only top level driver without a current F1 drive who did not contact him in the days following de Angelis' death to ask about the drive.|$|E
25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>driving</b> them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E
