25|$|Organic {{materials}} in a sediment can leave more traces than just fossils. Preserved tracks and burrows {{are examples of}} trace fossils (also called ichnofossils). Such traces are relatively rare. Most trace fossils are burrows of molluscs or arthropods. This burrowing is called bioturbation by sedimentologists. It can be a valuable indicator of the biological and <b>ecological</b> <b>environment</b> that existed after the sediment was deposited. On the other hand, the burrowing activity of organisms can destroy other (primary) structures in the sediment, making a reconstruction more difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Lower Morass {{consists}} of shallow estuaries, marshland and mangrove swamps providing a rich <b>ecological</b> <b>environment</b> {{for a broad}} range of fish, birds and other creatures including lobsters, mangrove snappers, snook and mullet. Here the river is joined by the YS river making the Lower Morass the largest (14,085acres) swamp environment in the Caribbean. American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) inhabit the swamps but the population has declined due mainly to loss of habitat as heavy draining for agricultural or tourist destroys their nesting places. Birds found here include egrets, herons and ospreys. The mangrove trees of the Lower Morass are sometimes spectacular with aerial roots sent out like spiders' legs, sometimes dropping 40feet into the river.|$|E

A great number of {{valuable}} species such as Lonicera oblata and Cypripedium shanxiense S. C. Chen are found here {{and many of them}} can not be conserved through ex situ conservation. Many Chinese professionals of biology and environmentalists deemed that if the Olympic venues are developed in such area, the rare species and integrated <b>ecological</b> <b>environment</b> will be catastrophically collapsed. Chinese government intended to remove such area out from the range of the natural reserves and chose some other area with few rare species as the reserves. Besides, the comments regarding the strict compliance with laws and protection of Songshan National Reserves are widely deleted or restricted in China. All these actions have been criticized by some media and the professionals of biology in China.|$|E

40|$|Suburbanization in the US largely {{occurred}} to solve various urban problems; however, {{it has also}} caused many issues, such as the decline of central urban areas, the waste of land resources, and the deterioration of <b>ecological</b> <b>environments</b> in the suburbs. Therefore, the study of suburbanization has received considerable attention in academia. Scholars have argued that suburbanization leads to ecological deterioration. To examine this viewpoint, the authors analyzed spatial-temporal changes in the ambient environment, the soil environment, the water <b>environment,</b> and other <b>ecological</b> <b>environments,</b> as well as carbon emissions of the central urban areas and the suburbs, in the suburbanization process exemplified by Shanghai. The results showed that suburbanization indeed caused many changes in ecological and environmental quality, but that the overall environmental quality {{in the suburbs of}} Shanghai remained better than that in the central urban area. It is important not to exaggerate the negative impact of suburbanization in metropolitan areas {{on the quality of the}} surrounding <b>ecological</b> <b>environments.</b> However, great attention must be given to controlling the diffusion of pollutants resulting from industrial and population suburbanization.

Therefore,the scope of rural village development and construction must take cognizance of economic production requirements, local culture, living improvements, preservation of nature, and ecological (Dorfoekologie) concernis in an integrated, comprehensive, creative, and sustainable manner.

Based on these models, there were 11 regions, most of which are located in Western China, slightly at risk from over-fertilization, while 14 regions located in central or eastern China were at a moderate hazard from overuse of fertilizers. Six regions in western China were found at <b>ecological</b> safety of <b>environment</b> because of small amounts of fertilizers used in these regions. <b>Ecological</b> safety of <b>environment</b> decreased along the gradient from northwest to southeast by fertilization. There were several factors that influence FEHI. It is obligatory for local governments to offer training to guide reasonable uses of fertilization. It would be prudent for China to establish laws to protect soils, especially to regulate the use of fertilizers in agriculture...|$|R
