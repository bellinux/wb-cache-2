25|$|In modern layman usage {{the term}} is {{restricted}} to the displacement of the third only and the dissonant second or fourth no longer needs to be held over (prepared) from the previous chord. Neither <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all though {{in the majority of}} cases the conventional stepwise resolution to the third is still observed. In post-bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as V chords, and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A good example is the jazz standard, Maiden Voyage.|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, Wordsworth wrote many {{poems that}} dealt with his youth. These poems were partly {{inspired}} by his conversations with his sister, Dorothy, whom he was living with in the Lake District at the time. The poems, beginning with The Butterfly and ending with To the Cuckoo, were all based on Wordsworth's recalling both the sensory and emotional experience of his childhood. From To the Cuckoo, he moved onto The Rainbow, both written on 26 March 1802, {{and then on to}} Ode: Intimation of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood. As he moved from poem to poem, he began to question why, as a child, he once was able to see an immortal presence within nature but as an adult that was fading away except in the few moments he was able to meditate on experiences found in poems like To the Cuckoo. While sitting at breakfast on 27 March, he began to compose the ode. He was able to write four stanzas that put forth the question about the faded image and ended, [...] "Where <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> the glory and the dream?" [...] The poem would remain in its smaller, four-stanza version until 1804.|$|E
2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E
