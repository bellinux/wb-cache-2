40|$|Driven {{largely by}} the rising {{popularity}} of Western style cuisine, particularly the offerings of quick service restaurants (QSRs), frozen french fries and other <b>frozen</b> <b>potato</b> products have become global commodities generating {{billions of dollars in}} revenue worldwide each year. Although exact worldwide production and sales figures for <b>frozen</b> <b>potato</b> products are not available, {{it has been estimated that}} total world <b>frozen</b> <b>potato</b> production capacity is about 11 million metric tons a year (Huffaker, 2003). Worldwide exports of <b>frozen</b> <b>potato</b> products (over 90 percent of which are frozen french fries) in 2002 were valued at 2. 2 billion dollars. This value is at the wholesale level and does not account for the billions of dollars in value added from the marketing at the retail level worldwide. However, after a long period of growth and expansion in the industry, many major markets are showing signs of maturing, with the growth rate in consumption slowing or even declining during the past few years. Concerns about health and increased consumption of alternative foods (e. g. other fruits and vegetables) in developed countries are likely to adversely affect the demand for potato products. On the other hand, per capita consumption of potatoes is low but growing in many developing countries.

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} processors, {{faced with the}} challenge of gaining and maintaining a healthy position in the competitive fruit {{and vegetable}} sector, are optimising traditional processes towards product quality. Using <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> as a case study, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential of improving the texture of potatoes by modifying the processing conditions. The texture of processed <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> is the result of the integral effect of the unit operations applied through the production chain. Production of <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> includes a blanching, a freezing, thawing/cooking step before being served. In this study, blanching temperatures from 70 to 97 °C up to 10 minutes were tested and combined with freezing by two freezing methods, impingement and air-blast freezing. The texture was measured after cooking of <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> in boiling water. Besides texture, water holding capacity, microstructural evaluation and pectinmethylesterase (PME) activity were determined. Blanching of potatoes prior to freezing can both improve water holding capacity and texture of potatoes, but this effect depends on the freezing rate and blanching temperature. Potatoes frozen with fastest freezing method are firmer and hold more water than the ones frozen by air-blast freezing. Blanching at 70 °C can lead to potatoes that after cooking retain a firmer texture, compared with blanching at 90 °C. The duration of the blanching treatment has also an important effect on texture changes. The studies of PME activity showed a good correlation between texture and PME for blanching at 90 °C, but for blanching at 70 °C and longer times, the development of texture does not seem to be solely related to PME activity. Microstructural studies showed that the differences in texture are due to differences in the degree of starch gelatinisation and integrity of the cellular structure...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the effects of replacing grain concentrates with roots and potatoes in dairy cow diets based upon large amounts of grass/alfalfa silage. The emphasis was on the possible improvement of microbial protein synthesis and nitrogen balance. Alfalfa dominated silage has a large excess of ruminally degradable protein that must be balanced with feed carbohydrates to avoid urinary nitrogen losses. The effects on ruminal fermentation pattern, intake and production were also studied. The thesis is based on two batch culture in vitro experiments and three animal experiments. The in vitro experiments compared fodder beets, barley/oats and raw, boiled or <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> as supplements to a silage diet incubated with rumen fluid from cows fed different diets. With respect to amounts fermented during 5 h incubation, supplements were ranked (P barley/oats > raw potatoes = <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> = unsupplemented silage. Substrates were numerically ranked in the same order with respect to microbial protein production, but due to larger variation they could only be divided into two groups, where fodder beets, boiled potatoes and barley/oats gave microbial yields not different from each other, but higher than for raw potatoes, <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes</b> or unsupplemented silage. Butyrate proportion was little affected by incubation substrate but fodder beets fed to rumen fluid donor cows increased butyrate molar proportion in vitro from 10. 7 to 13. 0 %. A change-over design experiment compared barley supplementation with fodder beet and potato supplementation of a silage diet for lactating cows. The fodder beet/potato diet lowered ad libitum silage intake by 0. 9 kg DM/d and milk yield decreased correspondingly by 1. 7 to 2. 3 kg/d. Microbial protein production and nitrogen balance were not increased by the fodder beet supplementation, but a part of N excretion was redirected from urine to feces. Fodder beets tended to decrease the ratio lipogenic/glucogenic VFA, by increasing propionate and butyrate at the expense of acetate. In an intake experiment, most of the cows consumed the maximum allowance of fodder beets (4. 6 kg DM/d) while there was a huge variation in the potato intake. A more synchronous feeding of degradable protein and readily available carbohydrates lowered the urinary nitrogen loss and increased allantoin excretion numerically but not significantly. A close correlation (R 2 = 0. 94) was found between total urinary N excretion and the ratio urea/creatinine in urine, which implies that spot sampling of urine may be a way to facilitate N balance measurements in lactating cows. In conclusion, a full replacement of grain by roots and potatoes can be done and the effects will be lowered urinary N losses but also a reduction in silage consumption and hence also milk production...|$|E

This analysis indicated that the Pacific Northwest dominated the growth experienced in this sector over this time period. Oregon's share of total U. S. employment in SIC 2037 increased from 7. 3 percent in 1954 to 16. 1 percent in 1982. Value added in Oregon was 16. 1 percent of the U. S. total in 1982, and growth in both employment and value added was at a greater rate than the overall U. S. rate of growth in this sector. Washington's share of employment increased from 10. 3 percent to 13 percent, and the share of U. S. total value added in this sector grew from 11 percent to 14. 2 percent. Value added by the freezing of fruits and vegetables in Idaho increased to 10. 3 percent of the U. S. total in 1982, and employment grew to a share of 10. 5 percent, from 3. 5 percent in 1954. An informal survey of executives in six food processing plants in Oregon suggested that expanding international export markets was essential to continued growth for this industry in the Pacific Northwest. A model of Japan's import demand of frozen vegetable products, specifically corn and potatoes, is estimated using data from 1978 through 1986 of real own price at the export site, Japanese consumer expenditures adjusted by Japan's CPI, and Japan's domestic production of frozen corn and potatoes. Commerce Department data on exports by Customs District was used to disaggregate import demand by region; namely Oregon, Washington, the two together as Pacific Northwest, and the total U. S. It was found that the demand for frozen corn imports is more responsive to changes in real own price than the import demand for <b>frozen</b> <b>potatoes.</b> Income elasticities were positive and higher for frozen potato import demand than for frozen corn demand, except for Oregon originating exports. Production in Japan of frozen corn has a higher negative impact on exports from Oregon ports than Washington based exports.
