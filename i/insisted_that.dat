5|$|Melvyn Douglas as Homer Bannon: Hud's father, Lonnie's {{grandfather}} {{and owner of}} the Bannon ranch. Although Paramount was doubtful about casting him due to his heart condition, Martin Ritt <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he was the right actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E

5|$|Oecolampadius and Gerbelius, Erasmus' subeditors, <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he {{introduce}} more {{readings from}} the minuscule 1 {{in the third}} edition. But according to Erasmus the text of this codex was altered from the Latin manuscripts, and had a secondary value.|$|E

5|$|The affair came {{amid the}} larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury {{regarding}} the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> statehood should {{come under the}} constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> a set timetable for the introduction of black majority rule {{would have to be}} in place before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.|$|E

5|$|Upon Presidents {{return to}} port, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the incident. Gathering testimony from Presidents officers and crewmen, they determined that Little Belt had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> President had fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{broadcast}} of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for 19 years, {{as both the}} network and Carruthers at that time considered the incident {{to be one of}} their biggest embarrassments.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> {{it should not be}} a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E

5|$|At age twenty-seven, {{he entered}} the Monastery of Stoudios, giving his life over {{completely}} to discipleship to his teacher Symeon the Studite. The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, electors from the zelanti faction {{attempted}} to elect Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, but this was not possible because of his unpopularity with both France and Spain. Following this attempt cardinals representing the Bourbons <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> no serious attempt to elect a new pope take place until all cardinals who were traveling had arrived, and until the electors had received instructions from the various Catholic monarchs.|$|E
