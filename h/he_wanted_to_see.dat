Blythe testified that when <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} {{told him that}} the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> just what it was that he was being so heavily {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E

5|$|As Paul, Christine and Michael {{continue}} to hit dead ends on solving Carmine's murder, Fen announces {{he wants to}} confess to a judge and be sentenced prison time; Christine and Lauren however are strongly against it. Just as Fen decides {{he is going to}} confess to the judge, Michael discovers that Carmine is in fact alive. He reveals that he was in fact being transported into witness protection the day of the banquet for giving the FBI evidence against another criminal, but <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lauren one last time. Fen shot him that night but doctors and medical examiners secretly revived him and sent him into witness protection. He refuses to return to Genoa City to exonerate Fen because of his own safety, so instead Michael films him confessing that he is alive. Michael arrives with the video before Fen can confess, and he is exonerated. After being reunited with his family, Michael and Lauren later mention that Fen had gone to Arizona to visit potential colleges.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{continued}} to conduct marine research after 1934, {{but he felt}} that he had seen what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> using the Bathysphere, and that further dives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost. With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna by means of dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions on board the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir Romanov {{had shown}} {{interest}} in investing in Scottish football {{for some time}} because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether Lithuanian footballers could prosper abroad.

He made approaches to Dundee United, Dundee and Dunfermline, but these were all rejected. He opened negotiations with {{the board of directors}} to invest in Hearts during August 2004. Romanov offered the prospect of the club staying at a redeveloped Tynecastle, which was very attractive to Hearts supporters. Board chairman George Foulkes pleaded that the shareholders should not scare Romanov away by demanding too much for their shares.|$|E

25|$|Union and Confederate {{forces in}} {{southern}} Texas had been observing an unofficial truce, but Union Colonel Theodore H.

The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle became a Confederate victory. Union forces were surprised by Confederate artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros. Rumors also persist that Confederates were assisted by a steam-powered French gun boat patrolling the Rio Grande.|$|E

At the end of the tournament he was controversially left out of New South Wales' side for the first match of the Sheffield Shield in favour of the younger Daniel Hughes despite being the top run-scorer of the entire tournament in the previous season.

25|$|Paul {{shut down}} Catherine's {{projects}} in Tsarskoye Selo {{and placed the}} redundant workforce at Brenna's disposal. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the castle externally complete {{by the end of}} 1797, so work on site, employing up to 6,000 men, continued day at night while all other residents of Saint Petersburg were ordered to sleep after dusk. Indeed, walls of the castle and nearby Exerzierhaus (Riding House) were built (but not finished in stone) by the end of October 1797. Brenna, realizing that existing project management controls will delay completion, demanded elimination of all financial controls and intermediaries between Paul and himself. Paul agreed and allowed Brenna unchecked access to state finances; in the end, total cost of the Castle reached six million roubles in gold.|$|E
25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation {{in the middle of}} its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Wilson won the Republican {{primary in}} California {{to replace the}} {{retiring}} U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa. Wilson's Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor Jerry Brown. Wilson {{was known as a}} fiscal conservative who supported Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> was one of his home state's U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the Armenian vote in the California governor's race between George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley. Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas. The Deukmejian voters likely also voted for Wilson for senator.|$|E
