40|$|Cultivation {{of heavy}} clay soils with the {{application}} of gypsum {{is often used to}} improve root exploration of the soil profile and hence more efficient use of the soil resource to enable higher grain yields of cereal crops. Soils in south-western Victoria are derived from tertiary basalts with high clay content and often dispersive subsoil. Cereal crops grown on these soils are prone to waterlogging. Waterlogging has been overcome with the use of raised beds. The hypothesis was that the heavy subsoil restricted rooting depth and hence efficient water extraction from the soil profile, particularly in the grain filling period during spring. Deep cultivation of the soil was proposed to overcome subsoil limitations. This study has compared the use of deep ripping, with and without the use of gypsum, to the use of <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> techniques. Soil water use and plant root density have been compared for the different cultivation treatments. Soil water use indicated that the use of <b>direct</b> <b>drill,</b> compared with deep ripping, was favoured during years with dry autumn or delayed autumn breaks. Surface soil water was conserved in the <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> treatments. The use of deep ripping, with and without the use of gypsum did not significantly increase the rooting density to a greater depth than <b>direct</b> <b>drill.</b> Furthermore the deeper roots failed to access soil water to improve grain yield compared with <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> treatments.

40|$|The {{impact of}} three {{cropping}} histories (sugarcane, maize and soybean) and two tillage practices (conventional tillage and <b>direct</b> <b>drill)</b> on plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes {{in the following}} sugarcane crop was examined in a field trial at Bundaberg. Soybean reduced populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) in comparison to previous crops of sugarcane or maize but increased populations of spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera) and maintained populations of dagger nematode (Xiphinema elongatum). However the effect of soybean on P zeae and M. javanica was no longer apparent 15 weeks after planting sugarcane, while later in the season, populations of these nematodes following soybean were as high as or higher than maize or sugarcane. Populations of P zeae were initially reduced by cultivation but due to strong resurgence tended to be higher in conventionally tilled than <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> plots {{at the end of}} the plant crop. Even greater tillage effects were observed with M. javanica and X. elongatum, as nematode populations were significantly higher in conventionally tilled than <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> plots late in the season. Populations of free-living nematodes in the upper 10 cm of soil were initially highest following soybean, but after 15, 35 and 59 weeks were lower than after sugarcane and contained fewer omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Conventional tillage increased populations of free-living nematodes in soil in comparison to <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> and was also detrimental to omnivorous and predatory nematodes. These results suggest that crop rotation and tillage not only affect plant-parasitic nematodes directly, but also have indirect effects by impacting on natural enemies that regulate nematode populations. More than 2 million nematodes/m(2) were often present in crop residues on the surface of <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> plots. Bacterial-feeding nematodes were predominant in residues early in the decomposition process but fungal-feeding nematodes predominated after 15 weeks. This indicates that fungi become an increasingly important component of the detritus food web as decomposition proceeds, and that that the rate of nutrient cycling decreases with time. Correlations between total numbers of free-living nematodes and mineral N concentrations in crop residues and surface soil suggested that the free-living nematode community may provide an indication of the rate of mineralisation of N from organic matter...|$|R

The application of this concept requires the existence of appropriate machinery that enables the use of direct seeding on land where plant residues of previous crops are present in the amount of minimum 30 %. In addition to significant environmental impacts, this concept provides positive economic effects: for the whole society by eliminating the cost caused by soil degradation, but also for individual agricultural producers through the elimination of a significant number of complex machining operations and savings in diesel fuel and working hours of machines and employees.

Expensive weed control in organic farming is the main reason why <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> technique in organic farming is hardly applied. The aim of the project is to develop a suitable <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> technology for organic cereal production under Finnish conditions that guarantees 1. Reasonable weed control, 2. Reduced traffic, 3. Improved soil structure, 4. Cost savings, 5. High cereal quality. Material and methods: Cereals will be drilled into white clover at the organic research farm of MTT Agricultural Engineering Research in Vihti. Some annual subcrop will also be tested. The experiment will be conducted with spring and winter cereals. At least the following four variants are tested: <b>Direct</b> <b>drilling</b> after ploughing, <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> after mowing of white clover, mowing of white clover after <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> and <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> without mowing of white clover. The project is divided into five work packages: 1. <b>Direct</b> <b>drilling</b> technology: Within this work package all technical aspects of the project are handled. Both spring cereal and winter cereal experiments will be established at Vihti. Four treatments are applied with five replications on 25 m* 3 m sized plots. The knowledge, which is obtained in MTT's project: "Direct drilling of spring cereals", will be utilized during this study. 2. Weed control: Within this work package quantity and distribution of weeds is recorded. Perennial weeds are regarded as major threat in cereal production, particularly in organic farming in Finland. The most common and harmful species are Elymus repens, Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis. During the growing period weed survey is conducted, weeds are counted and their dry matter mass is measured. 3. Soil structure: Within this work package quality of soil structure is recorded: Profile of tilled soil, soil odour, soil colour, soil crumb, soil layers, organic material, root development, soil surface and earth worm activities. 4. Crop management and quality: Organic cereal (mainly barley) production often suffers from protein quality. Beside a carefully planned crop rotation under sowing of legumes or legume blends e. g. during row harrowing can solve the problem. Because nitrogen is considered as the limiting factor in respect of quality and yield of organically produced cereals, simultaneous cultivation of cereals and legumes may support nitrogen nutrition. The following data will be collected: Growing stages and root development, yield, harvest index and grain quality in terms of protein quantity, thousand-grain weight, hectolitre weight and falling number, biological activity in terms of mass of edaphon, respiration, mineralisation of organic material, activity of enzymes, amino acid concentration, number of earthworms, environmental pollution in terms of N 2 O and NH 4 emission, biodiversity in terms of weed societies and diversity of fauna. 5.

40|$|Abstract. Phosphorus (P) and {{nitrogen}} (N) exports from cropping areas can {{be greater than}} those from uncropped areas. Conservation farming methods, involving minimal tillage and full stubble retention, offer significant benefits to grain cropping, but may increase nutrient concentrations in surface (i. e. 0 – 20 mm) soils, resulting in increased risks of nutrient mobilisation and loss. The effects of tillage and stubble management on soil nutrients that are potentially mobilised into runoff from a long-term trial site at Rutherglen (established in 1981) were investigated. On 2 different sampling dates (February and August 2006) soils from the 0 – 20, 20 – 50, and 50 – 150 mm depths were collected from 3 treatments: conventional cultivation with stubble burning (CCb); <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> with stubble burning (DDb); and <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> with stubble retained (DDr). In 2004, the trial was sown with wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Dollarbird), followed by faba beans in 2005 (Vicia faba L.) and wheat again in 2006. In August 2006, a rainfall simulation experiment was also conducted on these sites. All nutrient concentrations decreased with depth to 150 mm in all treatments, when both sampling dates were analysed together. This indicated that soil nutrient stratification was occurring in all 3 treatments. The CCb treatment only displayed differences between the 0 – 20 and 20 – 50 mm depths for soil organic C and ammonium-N.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal and spatial effects of two different <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> techniques on bulk density and penetration resistance in the near seed environment. A sandy loam growing small grain cereals was followed during the first 3 years after conversion from conventional tillage to <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> to reveal short-term changes in soil structure. A field experiment with four blocks was conducted in 1999 – 2001 where a conventional mouldboard ploughing–harrowing system (PL) was compared with <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> performed by either a chisel coulter drill (DD-C) or a single disc drill (DD-D). Effects on density and penetration resistance were measured in the field after first, second and third year of crop establishment (T 1, T 2 and T 3). Bulk density was determined at 0 – 100 mm depth using a dual probe gamma-ray transmission system. Penetration resistance was recorded in the field at 0 – 150 mm depth. At T 2 column samples (diameter: 180 mm, height: 200 mm) were taken with the seed row through the centre. Penetration resistance was determined in these samples in a 10 mm× 10 mm grid using a micropenetrometer (3 mm cone base diameter) at 0 to approximately 150 mm depth. Two samples from each treatment were analysed by a medical CT-scanner to determine spatial differences in bulk density. Irrespective of coulter type <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> gave a fast compaction of the arable layer below seeding depth when shifting from mouldboard ploughing to <b>direct</b> <b>drilling.</b> Soil strength was substantially higher already in the first year of <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> (i. e., maximum 0. 4 and 1. 2 MPa, for PL and DD-D/DD-C, respectively). Critical high penetration resistance (> 2. 0 MPa) and bulk density levels (> 1. 5 g cm- 3) were reached at T 2 and remained at the same level at T 3. The DD-C direct drill produced a more favourable soil environment for crop establishment than the DD-D drill. A layer of approximately 40 mm loose granular soil above seeding depth and no indication of a direct compaction effect was found for the DD-C treatment. In contrast, the field as well as the laboratory results indicated a direct compacting effect for the DD-D drill. Despite the lack of direct compaction effect from the DD-C drill itself, evidence suggest that periodic non-inversion soil loosening of the lower part of the arable layer is needed on direct drilled sandy loam soil in a moist and cool climate...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY – There are {{changes in}} the physical, {{chemical}} and biological properties of the soil, when <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> is adopted. This presentation reports experimental results for soil fertility and the response of crops to fertilizers under <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> {{in the south of}} Portugal. The increase of soil organic matter content, that usually occurs under no tillage, seems to be the only effective way to overcome the poor nitrogen-use efficiency of winter cereals under Mediterranean conditions. The normal organic matter content of the soil in the region is only about 1 %. For this level of organic matter, the results indicate that the most economical nitrogen application would be 160 kg N/ha and the correspondent yield would be 3063 kg wheat/ha. However, for an organic matter content of 3 % the most economical nitrogen level would be only 37 kg N/ha and the corresponding yield 3862 kg/ha. The application of fertilizers to the soil surface under <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> can increase soil acidity of the top-most layer. However, the experimental results show that this effect is temporary and the increase in soil organic matter offsets this effect on pH. The soils under <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> develop a very steep gradient in the concentration of nutrient, especially those less mobile in the soil, such as phosphorus. Experimental results suggest that this is one beneficial effect of <b>direct</b> <b>drilling.</b> Another significant interaction between tillage and fertilization is the importance of the timing of the first nitrogen topdressing application (at tillering stage) especially during wet winters. Under conventional tillage systems this can be delayed because of the inability to get onto the land with farm machinery under wet conditions. Experimental results will be presented that quantify this effect...|$|E

Recent studies have highlighted the potential for these breaks to exacerbate nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. An experiment was implemented in 2012 to evaluate the impact of two fallow management options (bare fallow and soybean break crop) and different soybean residue management practices on N 2 O emissions and sugarcane productivity. The bare fallow plots were conventionally tilled, whereas the soybean treatments were either tilled, not tilled, residue sprayed with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) prior to tillage or had a triticale ‘catch crop’ sown between the soybean and sugarcane crops. The fallow plots received either no nitrogen (N 0) or fully fertilised (N 145) whereas the soybean treatments received 25 kg N/ha at planting only. The Fallow N 145 treatment yielded 8 % more cane than the soybean tilled treatment. However there was no statistical difference in sugar productivity. Cane yield was correlated with stalk number that was correlated to soil mineral nitrogen status in January. There was only 30 % more N/ha in the above-ground biomass between the Fallow N 145 and the Fallow N 0 treatment; highlighting poor fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency. Supplying adequate nitrogen to meet productivity requirements without causing environmental harm remains a challenge for the Australian sugar industry.

Four replicate plots of the forages were established (12 x 7. 5 m) in 2009; these were split (10 x 3. 75 m) in spring 2013 and wheat established either after ploughing, or seeds directly drilled; with wheat harvested autumn 2013. It was hypothesised that <b>direct</b> <b>drill</b> would disturb the food web less than ploughing, whilst the plots which were previously legumes would retain a different soil faunal population, even though the crop was the same across all plots. The effect on soil faunal populations of these previous different forage crops and sowing method were assessed after wheat harvest; the soil fauna sampled included microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna. Overall our results have shown that for a number of soil faunal groups across the three scales of sampling, the previous forage still had a significant effect over the current soil food web, even though the ecosystem has now been standardised between the different plots. There was also a significant affect over all soil faunal populations when assessing the difference in cultivation method ? plough versus <b>direct</b> <b>drill.</b> Our findings have begun to show the linkage between soil biodiversity and the effect of agriculture on the whole ecosystem and shows the potential for managing a healthy soil food web and maintaining it, within agricultural production.

40|$|Xeralfs with {{predominantly}} sandy, or {{sandy loam}} surface textures are widespread throughout the Mediterranean climatic {{region of the}} southern Australian wheatbelt. The surface structure of these soils is prone to deterioration with frequent cropping and cultivation. Recognition of this problem has led to interest in conservation tillage as one method for reducing soil degradation. To test the efficacy of this system and to understand the role of crop rotation, information is needed on how different tillage and rotation practices affect the surface stability and chemical properties of these soils. Changes in the surface stability and chemical properties of a red-brown earth (Xeralf) arising after 5 years in a tillage and rotation trial were measured. The stability of air-dried earthworm casts was also measured because of growing interest in their role in soil structure development. Organic carbon levels were significantly higher with <b>direct</b> <b>drilling,</b> compared to conventional cultivation, but were not significantly affected by crop rotation. Aggregate stability was significantly affected by the percentage of organic carbon. Earthworm casts contained relatively low levels of organic carbon and {{were among the most}} unstable aggregates tested. Aggregate disruption arising from the escape of entrapped compressed air was found to have less effect on aggregates from <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> than on aggregates from conventional cultivation, or eathworm casts. In most cases, the release of air resulted in the breakdown of aggregates > 1 mm to smaller aggregates > 250 μm. As expected for a surface soil of low clay content, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) was also strongly dependent upon the percentage of organic carbon and in consequence, was higher with <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> than with conventional cultivation. CEC was also significantly greater under the wheat-lupin rotation than either the wheat-pasture rotation or continuous wheat. Soil pH declined in all tillage and rotation treatments relative to the pH under the original untilled continuous pasture. The smallest decrease occurred in the wheat-lupin rotation and <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> likewise produced only a minor drop in pH. <b>Direct</b> <b>drilling</b> also significantly increased the percentage of total soil nitrogen. The results indicate that soil degradation can be effectively reduced under crop management systems that maximise surface cover with residues and reduce the rate of decomposition of organic matter by <b>direct</b> <b>drilling...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY There are {{changes in}} the physical, {{chemical}} and biological properties of the soil, when <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> is adopted. This presentation reports experimental results for soil fertility and the response of crops to fertilizers under <b>direct</b> <b>drilling</b> {{in the south of}} Portugal. The increase of soil organic matter content, that usually occurs under no tillage, seems to be the only effective way to overcome the poor nitrogen-use efficiency of winter cereals under Mediterranean conditions. The normal organic matter content of the soil in the region is only about 1 %. For this level of organic matter, the results indicate that the most economical nitrogen application would b...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{determining}} {{of reduced}} tillage techniques in green bean farming {{as a second}} crop after harvesting wheat was targeted. To this aim, four different soil tillage methods namely, heavy-duty disc harrow (HD), rotary tiller (ROT), heavy-duty disc harrow plus rotary tiller (HD+ROT) and no-tillage (NT) (seeding by <b>direct</b> <b>drill)</b> were examined. Experiments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. The highest green beans yields were obtained in HD+ROT and NT as 5, 862. 1 and 5, 829. 3 Mg/ha, respectively. The lowest green bean yield was found in HD as 3, 076. 7 Mg/ha. The highest fuel consumption was measured 30. 60 L ha- 1 for HD+ROT whereas the lowest value was found 7. 50 L ha- 1 for NT. No tillage method gave the best results for fuel consumption and effective power requirement. It is concluded that no-tillage method {{can be used in}} second crop green bean in the Thrace Region due to economic and erosion conditions...|$|R
40|$|Perennial crops undersown in cereals provide {{ground cover}} from harvest of the cereal crop to sowing {{of the next}} crop. Such cover crops can e. g. reduce soil erosion, {{nutrient}} leaching and N fertiliser requirements of the succeeding crop. The objective of this thesis was to develop guidelines on how to prevent grain yield losses due to competition from the perennial crops or to increase the yield of the main crops. The effects of species and time of undersowing of perennial crops in spring cereals, and the management of an intercropping system in which winter oilseed rape or consecutive crops of winter wheat were established in a remaining crop of white clover, were studied. The biomass of undersown cover crops {{by the time of}} the harvest of spring barley was significantly reduced with each delay in the undersowing, but the increase in biomass during autumn was generally not affected. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) reduced the grain yield by 6 and 1 %, respectively, but may both be suitable as cover crops with the appropriate main crop, time of undersowing and seed rate. Undersown white clover (Trifolium repens L.) /perennial ryegrass mixtures kept soil mineral N as low as pure ryegrass and improved the residual effect. This suggests that clover in the cover crops may reduce the N fertiliser requirements of the succeeding crop without increased N leaching. Grain yields were smaller in the wheat/clover system than with wheat alone when the wheat was <b>direct</b> <b>drilled</b> and larger when sown after stubble cultivation. <b>Direct</b> <b>drilled</b> wheat and rape yielded more with clover varieties less adapted to the cold climate than with varieties in common use in the area. Grain yield increased, weeds were efficiently controlled and the white clover crop maintained by applying herbicides that mainly act as germination inhibitors when a third consecutive wheat crop had 1 – 2 leaves. It was possible to conclude that (1) the tillage performed in conjunction with the sowing of wheat, (2) the weed control practice, and (3) the choice of clover variety, have large effects on the yield of the winter annuals in the intercropping system...|$|R
