5000|$|Monilinia oxycocci (Woronin) Honey, (synonym Sclerotinia oxycocci), {{common names}} Cranberry Cottonball, Cranberry <b>Hard</b> <b>Rot,</b> Tip Blight, is a fungal {{infection}} of the cranberry plant (Vaccinium macrocarpon). The tips of young flowering shoots wilt before they flower. Fruit that forms on the plant can then be infected by the asexual spores traveling through the plant, causing the berries to harden, turn cottony on the inside, and dry out instead of maturing. [...] The berries are filled with a cotton-like fungus and are generally yellowish with tan stripes or blotches at maturity, making them unmarketable. It results in important economic impacts on many cranberry marshes, particularly in Wisconsin.|$|E
50|$|Within the ovary, fungal mycelia form a white cottony mass {{in each of}} {{the four}} locules, or fruit seed cavities, and grow into the fleshy fruit tissue. The {{infected}} berry itself remains firm, categorizing this type of rot as a <b>hard</b> <b>rot</b> (a soft rot is characterized by total tissue maceration and seepage). Eventually, the fungus consumes the fruit pericarp and a hard black pseudosclerotium (mummy) develops from 25 - 50% of the diseased fruit. Mature pseudosclerotia often float and may be dispersed by harvest or cold protection floods. The fungus will overwinter in these mummies—which can be difficult to detect—at or near the soil surface. Wet conditions in the spring stimulate apothecia growth and the cycle moves forward. Berries without pseudosclerotia decompose by the next spring.|$|E

Diseases discussed include early rot, bitter rot (anthracnose), end rot (blossom end rot and stem end rot), <b>hard</b> <b>rot</b> and tip blight, red gall, rose bloom (Massachusetts false blossom, hypertrophy), red leaf spot, false blossom (Wisconsin false blossom, phyllody), and black rot...|$|E
5000|$|Siamese {{rosewood}} is denser than water, fine grained, {{and high}} in oils and resins. These properties make them dimensionally stable, <b>hard</b> wearing, <b>rot</b> and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant. The density and toughness of the wood also allows furniture to be built {{without the use of}} glue and nails, but rather constructed from jointery and doweling alone.|$|R
50|$|A {{timber bridge}} was {{constructed}} {{at the site}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century, built to a particularly robust design because it catered for heavy military traffic. When Freetown Christiania was founded in 1971, the bridge became the main link between the two parts of the community, the larger and more 'urban' Christianshavn side and the smaller and more 'rural' Amager Side.In the 1990s it became clear that the bridge was in strong need of thorough restoration. When it was dismantled it turned out that it was hit even <b>harder</b> with <b>rot</b> than had first been assumed and that a brand new bridge was needed. A team of German Journeymen from Ax & Kelle was engaged in the project and construction started in April 1998. Ten journeymen spent a total of 2,500 hours over a period of three month before the bridge was completed.|$|R
40|$|Although taro is {{susceptible}} to attack by at least twenty-three pathogens, only a few cause serious reduction in growth and production. Phytophthora blight (Phytophthora colocasiae) and Pythium root and corm rot (Pythium spp.) are the most serious fungal diseases of taro. Phytophthora blight is not yet found in Samoa, the Marquesas, the Society and Cook Islands. Dithane-M 45 is available for control of Phytophthora blight. Pythium root and corm rot is found where ever taro is grown. Five Pythium spp. have been implicated as causal agents of the disease. Captan provides good control of the disease. Data to apply for metalaxyl registration on taro for control of Pythium root and corm rots are being collected. Phyllosticta leaf spot (Phyllosticta colocasiophila), Sclerotium blight (Sclerotium rolfsii), Black rot(Ceratocystis fimbriata), Rhizopus rot (Rhizopus stolonifer), Phytophthora root rot (P. palmivora) and Fusarium dry rot (Fusarium solani) are other fungal diseases which may be locally important. <b>Hard</b> <b>rot</b> (unknown etiology) {{is a major problem}} in wetland taro culture where it can cause substantial losses. Erwinia spp. may cause bacterial soft rots. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause root galls and corm malformations...|$|E
40|$|Dry rot of {{pumpkins}} {{caused by}} F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae race 2 {{is a well}} known post harvest disease. In Malaysia, crust-like lesions are often observed {{on the surface of}} pumpkins in local markets. These symptoms look like the scab caused by Cladosporium cucumerinum or the Fusarium rot caused by Fusarium spp. Most of the symptomatic crusts did not soften or develop further in our observations. As these crusts are merely considered as the mechanical injuries in the local markets, they do not reduce their marketability of pumpkin. However, F. solani was frequently isolated from these symptoms in our preliminary study. Thus these crust symptoms were distinguished from the scab, the Fusarium rot, the preharvest dry, <b>hard</b> <b>rot</b> (type 1) and the dry rot caused by other Fusarium spp. as reported previously. Histological observation of naturally occurring raised pimples or crust symptoms showed periderm formation that apparently healed the loss of palisade layer. Therefore, hereafter, the term ‘canker’ is used to explain the crust symptoms and ‘scab’ for the raised pimples. A majority of the fungal isolates from the canker was identified as F. solani (41. 6...|$|E
