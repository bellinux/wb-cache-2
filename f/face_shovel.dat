50|$|The museum aims {{to collect}} and operate {{industrial}} locomotives and mineral wagons from iron ore quarries. They also have a <b>face</b> <b>shovel,</b> a drag line excavator and dumpers as used in quarry systems. The cab of the massive dragline excavator Sundew is on display here.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler track frames and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included <b>face</b> <b>shovel,</b> dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|E
50|$|Mining is via {{conventional}} {{drill and}} blast mining via <b>face</b> <b>shovels</b> and dump trucks. Around 15 million tonnes of rock is moved {{in any given}} year, consisting primarily of waste rock.|$|R
5000|$|Initially two 550 t CAT6050BH {{backhoes}} {{operating in}} Ore and overburden with custom buckets, {{followed by the}} addition of two CAT6060FS AC electric <b>face</b> <b>shovels</b> operating in overburden commencing in Year 5 and 7 when the third and fourth shovels are required to meet production ...|$|R
50|$|Bradken's GET & Buckets Business is {{a leader}} in the design and {{manufacture}} of differentiated Ground Engaging Tools (GET), associated wear parts and buckets to fit front-end loaders, <b>face</b> <b>shovels</b> and hydraulic excavators. The Business also manufactures and supplies customised rigging packages and buckets to suit a variety of dragline machines.|$|R
5000|$|Though the {{original}} colliery closed, mining was practised until quite recently: {{as late as}} 1997, mining company The Banks Group opened up a 170 acre open-pit mine at Pegswood Moor, from which they extracted some 1.4 million tons of coal, {{with the help of}} a 236-ton <b>face</b> <b>shovel</b> made by Orenstein & Koppel. Also reaped was 84,000 tons of fire clay, a kind of high temperature resistant clay often found between coal layers. Mining there stopped in 2004, and the pit was converted into the Pegswood Community Park, which includes [...] "a dedicated nature reserve, a new woodland and ponds." [...] The second phase of the park's construction would also [...] "provide a fishing lake, an amphitheatre sculpted out of the landform and a footpath link from Pegswood to Morpeth." [...] Extensive open-pit mining still takes place in the area, but such operations remain controversial even when former sites are restored.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{hydraulic}} excavator and mechanical excavator. Due to the flexibility and mobility, hydraulic excavator has almost replaced the mechanical excavator. But there still exists some problems such as hydraulic leaks and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining. On the other hand, the latter one is the excavator of choice in oil sands digging and surface mining for its durability, high productivity and low ownership costs resulting from long economic operating life, but lacks flexibility due to the structural limitations. This paper introduces an innovative design of mechanical excavator with controllable mechanism based on functional analysis of the traditional hydraulic excavator. The solving model in the form of Function-Effect-Technical Action Process-Executive Action-Mechanism (F-E-P-A-M) is used. A planar 2 Degree-OF-Freedom (DOF) controllable mechanism is adopted as the executive mechanism. A backhoe type and a <b>face</b> <b>shovel</b> type excavator both with the ability to accomplish flexible output trajectories by the joint operations of three servo-motors are proposed...|$|E
60|$|Old Doctor Portman {{was one of}} the few {{who came}} from the venerable gate. Spying Pen, he came and shook him by the hand, and eyed with wonder Pen's friend, from whose mouth and cigar clouds of {{fragrance}} issued, which curled round the Doctor's honest <b>face</b> and <b>shovel</b> hat.|$|R
50|$|Jim chases Banks down, {{and they}} fight. Jim chases Banks {{down a hill}} and into what looks like an {{abandoned}} factory. Banks even fires a flare gun at Jim. They try to hit each other with shovels. Banks hits Jim a couple of times, and then Jim beats Banks up and hits Banks in the <b>face</b> with a <b>shovel,</b> knocking Banks down.|$|R
60|$|Many {{contingencies}} {{were considered}} in the making, but the suit would fit Tommy by and by if he grew, or it shrunk, {{and they did not}} pass each other in the night. When proud Tommy first put on his suit the most unexpected shyness overcame him, and having set off vaingloriously he stuck on the stair and wanted to hide. Shovel, who had been having an argument with his old girl, came, all boastful bumps, to him, and Tommy just stood still with a self-conscious simper on his <b>face.</b> And <b>Shovel,</b> who could have damped him considerably, behaved in the most honorable manner, initiating him gravely into the higher life, much as you show the new member round your club.|$|R

Brian arrives at an {{abandoned}} nuclear testing site and surprises Early, hitting him in the <b>face</b> with a <b>shovel.</b> Brian finds Carrie bloodied and handcuffed to a bed, having been sexually assaulted. Early, who was only stunned, attacks Brian and they struggle until Early is hit over the head by Carrie. When Early continues the attack, Brian kills him.|$|R

50|$|The shovel racer {{typically}} races on a basic snow shovel. The rider {{sits in the}} <b>shovel</b> <b>facing</b> {{the handle}} and leans back with his feet pointed forwards. In some cases, shovel racers have extensively modified shovels {{to the point that}} they bear little resemblance to normal shovels. These shovels have been banned from competition due to safety concerns after a high profile accident on a modified shovel. Competitors generally wax the underside of the shovel in order to increase its speed. The top speed of elite shovel racers can range up to 70 miles per hour (112 km/h).|$|R

He is a cheerful, charming and handsome young gentleman, and does his best to help [...] "Mrs. Andrews" [...] (really Annabel) as she struggles through a tough day. He has some occasional breathing trouble, attributed to his adenoids and possibly a psychosomatic reaction to his own mother, which renders his voice nasal, making him unable to pronounce the letters m and n clearly. Because of this, Annabel has always believed his name to be Boris, when it is in fact Morris. Unfortunately, she suffers the exact opposite misunderstanding when he offers to prepare a [...] "beetloaf" [...] for a dinner party with the limited assortment of culinary ingredients available, and she believes he is going to save dinner by providing a much more sensible meatloaf, but she is won over when she samples the new dish and finds it tasty.|$|R
