2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt.

However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon.

How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Bill passed by Parliament.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Philip Lane {{looks at the}} role of {{external}} funding in the funding of infrastructure. He starts with a review of literature which is, in large part, a review of Philip’s own work. This is appropriate given that the body of work he has put together, particularly with Gian Maria Milesi‑Ferretti, is the standard-setter {{when looking at the}} issue of cross-border financial stocks and flows. The difference between Lane’s paper and the previous paper in this session by Marcel Fratzscher is primarily one of frequency. Fratzscher’s paper examines weekly data while Lane’s paper utilises decadal data. Lane uses this analysis of the data on external positions to examine the role of foreign capital flows in funding infrastructure. He notes that accessing this larger pool of capital available offshore for infrastructure reduces the likelihood of crowding out that could occur if only domestic funding were sought. I am not sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> completely <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this argument. Capital is essentially fungible, so there is no particular reason (on this grounds) why offshore funding is more desirable for funding infrastructure rather than any other part of the economy where desired investment or spending exceeds savings. For example, infrastructure could be entirely domestically funded, but other areas of corporate activity could be funded from abroad...|$|R
