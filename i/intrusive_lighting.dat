This paper presents a system for performance-based character animation that enables any user to control the facial expressions of a digital avatar in realtime. The user is recorded in a natural environment using a non-intrusive, commercially available 3 D sensor. The simplicity of this acquisition device comes {{at the cost of}} high noise levels in the acquired data. To effectively map low-quality 2 D images and 3 D depth maps to realistic facial expressions, we introduce a novel face tracking algorithm that combines geometry and texture registration with pre-recorded animation priors in a single optimization. Formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation in a reduced parameter space, our method implicitly exploits temporal coherence to stabilize the tracking. We demonstrate that compelling 3 D facial dynamics can be reconstructed in realtime without the use of face markers, <b>intrusive</b> <b>lighting,</b> or complex scanning hardware. This makes our system easy to deploy and facilitates a range of new applications, e. g. in digital gameplay or social interactions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for reflectance function (BRDF) estimation, which uses polarisation information and photometric stereo. The {{first stage of}} the technique is standard and involves the acquisition of polarisation information (angle and degree of polarisation) using a linear polariser and a digital camera. This yields a field of ambiguous surface normal estimates for an arbitrarily shaped object. A photometric stereo algorithm is then used with three different light source directions to disambiguate the surface normals. Next, the proposed algorithm constructs a 3 D histogram of the surface normals and pixel brightnesses. A surface, representing the BRDF, is then fitted to the histogram data using simulated annealing optimisation. The result {{is a set of}} Cartesian triples that relate the surface normals to the observed pixel brightnesses. Unlike most previous techniques for BRDF estimation, the technique is image-based and does not require sophisticated equipment or <b>intrusive</b> <b>light</b> sources. Although the technique is restricted to smooth and slightly rough dielectric objects, no prior knowledge about the surface geometry is assumed...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the acquisition of model data for automatic 3 D face recognition applications. As 3 D methods become progressively more popular in face recognition research, the need for fast and accurate data capture has become crucial. This paper is motivated by this need and offers three primary contributions. Firstly, the paper demonstrates that four-source photometric stereo offers a potential means for data capture that is computationally and financially viable and easily deployable in commercial settings. We have shown that both visible <b>light</b> and less <b>intrusive</b> near infrared <b>light</b> is suitable for facial illumination. The second contribution is a detailed set of experimental results that compare the accuracy of the device to ground truth, which was captured using a commercial projected pattern range finder. Importantly, we show that not only is near infrared light a valid alternative to the more commonly exploited visible light, but that it actually gives more accurate reconstructions. Finally, we assess the validity of the Lambertian assumption on skin reflectance data and show that better results may be obtained by incorporating more advanced reflectance functions, such as the Oren-Nayar model...|$|R
40|$|The 24 -hour day/night cycle {{naturally}} {{helps to}} maintain balance and stability within a nocturnal ecosystem. While {{the rhythms of}} the natural light-dark cycle of day and night are able maintain a stable balance with ecological and human-made activities {{in relation to the}} nature of lighting and darkness, light pollution still significantly reduces average human well-being, impacts on the visibility of faint night sky objects during the night with the naked eye and telescope, and damages the night environment. It can be defined as “every form of artificial light {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time which creates a sky glow, glare, nuisance, and other relevant causes of environmental degradation including some properties of artificial light which emit non-environmentally friendly or inappropriate light. ” Light pollution can reduce human health, interfere with the nocturnal and/or dark-sky environment, reduce transportation safety and waste lighting energy consumption. Therefore, hard laws and soft laws from international and national jurisdictions established a duty on local authorities to manage outdoor lights and control all key elements of light pollution so as to ensure that people are not exposed to risks to the night environment. These also include environmental risks arising from a sky glow when measuring the non-environmentally atmospheric smog that hangs over urban areas at night where the level of exterior lighting from outdoor light sources is relatively high. However, English law does not contain stage processes and responsibilities for local authorities to deal with all aspects of outdoor light pollution. It also does not contain powers concerning the use of certain measurable degrees of non-environmentally friendly light metric, together with powers for the Government to approve a single framework for the minimisation of sky glow in public atmospheric areas at night. The main purpose of this study is to use comparative law studies to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of light pollution laws in different jurisdictions where adopted legislation has been designed to limit light pollution from outdoor light fixtures and design, and to improve national or local light pollution regulatory frameworks by providing better outdoor lighting practices through making valuable contributions to a comparison of international, European, national and local light pollution laws and to the improvement of regulatory measures in English legal system. It also proposes to do so by illustrating key differences between England and other jurisdictions and examining a set of necessary or proportional regulatory standards to combat light pollution. This research’s review of the jurisdictions and the legal systems available for both light pollution control and sustainable lighting practices has highlighted the recent evidence of such influence of hard and soft law on legislation in selected countries. When comparative law on different jurisdictions is discussed, the influence of a comparative approach in each national or municipal light pollution law is, at most, one of finding inspiration in the procedure of establishing a number of necessary steps to reforming the English law of light pollution control in favour of a better solution. Taking legal action to reduce the effects of non-environmentally friendly or unnecessary lights at night provides an excellent opportunity to deliver further benefits to both environmental lighting practices and energy efficiency. This research also highlights the key legal aspects concerning light pollution and outlines the ways in which regulators and policy makers can make the most of the interconnections between regulatory measures to address key elements of outdoor light pollution, such as sky glow, glare and <b>intrusive</b> <b>light.</b> It is intended to outline a wider vision for how English law can prevent all key elements of light pollution. This research also comparatively examines why England should be committed to ensuring that the English regulatory measures compare favourably with the global and regional light pollution control standards in the highest performing jurisdictions, and establishes stringent legal requirements for light pollution control which measure up to the highest standards set internationally. In the final Chapter we present useful recommendations which highlight instances in which England should be able to promote the application of necessary principles and stage processes through comparative effectiveness for outdoor lighting practices by applying international, regional and national criteria for different forms of outdoor lighting practices...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{camera and}} flash system offers dazzle-free {{photography}} by hiding the {{flash in the}} non-visible spectrum. A pair of images are captured at a blur-free shutter speed, one using a multi-spectral flash (F), the other using ambient illumination (A) {{which in this case}} is 1 / 100 th of that required for a correct exposure. The pair are combined to give an output image (R) which is of comparable quality to a reference long exposure shot (L). The figures in this paper are best viewed on screen, rather than in print. Camera flashes produce <b>intrusive</b> bursts of <b>light</b> that disturb or daz-zle. We present a prototype camera and flash that uses infra-red and ultra-violet light mostly outside the visible range to capture pictures in low-light conditions. This “dark ” flash is at least two orders of magnitude dimmer than conventional flashes for a comparable exposure. Building on ideas from flash/no-flash photography, we capture a pair of images, one using the dark flash, other using the dim ambient illumination alone. We then exploit the correlations between images recorded at different wavelengths to denoise the ambient image and restore fine details to give a high quality result, even in very weak illumination. The processing techniques {{can also be used to}} denoise images captured with conventional cameras...|$|R
