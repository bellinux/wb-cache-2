40|$|Lifetime {{performance}} variability is {{a powerful}} tool for evaluating herd management. Although efficiency is a key aspect of performance, it has not been integrated into existing studies on the variability of lifetime performance. The goal of the present article is to analyse the effects of various herd management options on the variability of lifetime performance by integrating criteria relative to feed efficiency. A herd model developed for dairy goat systems was used in three virtual experiments to test the effects of the diet energy level, the segmentation of the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> and the mean production potential of the herd on the variability of lifetime performance. Principal component analysis showed that the variability of lifetime performance was structured around the first axis related to longevity and production and the second related to the variables used in feed efficiency calculation. The intra-management variability was expressed on the first axis (longevity and production), whereas the inter-management variability was expressed on the second axis (feed efficiency) and was mainly influenced by the combination of the diet energy level and the mean production potential. Similar feed efficiencies were attained with different management options. Still, such combinations relied on different biological bases and, {{at the level of the}} individual, contrasting results were observed in the relationship between the obtained pattern of performance (in response to diet energy) and the reference pattern of performance (defined by the production potential). Indeed, our results showed that over-feeding interacted with the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> segmentation: a high level of <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> segmentation generated a low proportion of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential, whereas a single ration generated a larger proportion. At the herd level, the diet energy level and the herd production potential had marked effects on production and efficiency due to dilution of fixed production costs (i. e. maintenance requirements). Management options led to similar production and feed efficiencies at the herd level while giving large contrasts in the proportions of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential. These results suggested that analysing individual variability on the basis of criteria related to production processes could improve the assessment of herd management. The herd model opens promising perspectives in studying whether individual variability represents an advantage for herd performance...|$|E

Growth performance obtained with two feeding plans previously tested in silico was compared with results from an in vivo experiment on a batch of pigs of the same crossbreed. Pigs were housed in pens of six pigs of the same sex each (n = 168). They were offered feed ad libitum (AL) or were restricted (RA) with an increase in feed allowance of 27 g/d to a maximum allowance of 2. 40 and 2. 70 kg/d, for gilts and barrows, respectively. A two-phase feeding strategy was applied, with 0, 9 and 0. 7 g of digestible lysine per MJ of net energy (NE) in diets provided before or after 65 kg BW (9. 75 MJ NE/kg), respectively. Growth was similar to that obtained by simulation. In vivo, BW 1 was more homogenous with the restricted <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> than with the ad libitum <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> (P = 0. 02), in association with a more homogenous feed intake per pen. Although competition for feedwas not taken into account in the simulations, in vivo and in silico BW 1 coefficients of variation were very similar (AL: 8. 8 vs 8. 3 % / RA: 6. 8 vs 5. 7 %, respectively).

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of standing pasture biomass in livestock production systems {{is a major}} factor for improving <b>feed</b> <b>planning.</b> Several tools are available to achieve this, including the GrassMaster II capacitance meter. This tool relies on an electrical signal, which is modified by the surrounding pasture. There is limited knowledge on how this capacitance meter performs in Mediterranean pastures. Therefore, we evaluated the GrassMaster II under Mediterranean conditions to determine (i) the effect of pasture moisture content (PMC) on the meter’s ability to estimate pasture green matter (GM) and dry matter (DM) yields, and (ii) the spatial variability and temporal stability of corrected meter readings (CMR) and DM in a bio-diverse pasture. Field tests were carried out with typical pastures of the southern region of Portugal (grasses, legumes, mixture and volunteer annual species) and at different phenological stages (and different PMC). There were significant positive linear relations between CMR and GM (r 2 = 0. 60, P 80 % (r 2 = 0. 57, P < 0. 01, RMSE = 2856. 7 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE= 17. 1 % to GM; and r 2 = 0. 51, P < 0. 01,RMSE = 353. 7 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE = 14. 3 % to DM). Therefore, under the conditions of this current study there exists an optimum PMC (%) for estimating both GM and DM with the GrassMaster II. Repeated-measurements taken at the same location on different dates and conditions in a bio-diverse pasture showed similar and stable patterns between CMR and DM (r 2 = 0. 67, P < 0. 01, RMSE = 136. 1 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE = 6. 5 %).

The R rabbits were fed from 80 % (first days on trial) to 100 % (end of 3 rd wk) of ad libitum intake, whereafter R rabbits had free access to feed. The 3 <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> were: MM plan, M diet with moderate digestible energy (DE) content, 10. 6 MJ/kg, throughout the trial; HH plan, H diet with high DE content, 11. 1 MJ/kg, throughout the trial; MH plan, M diet for the first 3 wk and H diet for the last 2 wk. Feed restriction did not affect nutrient digestibility, growth rate on the whole trial and slaughter results, but improved feed conversion (2. 96 vs. 2. 89 in L and R rabbits, respectively; P< 0. 01) and reduced N excretion (2. 16 vs. 2. 07 g excreted N/d, in L and R rabbits; P< 0. 05). At {{the end of the}} first period (55 d), R rabbits showed lower empty body protein, lipid, and gross energy gains than L rabbits, but differences disappeared within the end of the trial.

40|$|This review {{describes}} the principal causes of poor welfare in beef cattle and veal calves raised in intensive husbandry systems in Italy. Nowadays {{there are no}} specific regulations in force for beef cattle welfare. However, a document produced in 2001 by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare of the European Commission on Health and Consumer Protection identified the main causes of inadequate welfare levels in the different cattle rearing systems in Europe. In Italy and in the Po Valley in particular, the beef cattle farms are mainly finishing units characterised by animals kept at high density in multiple pens and fed high starch diets. Under these rearing conditions the limited space allowance {{is one of the}} most important issues impairing animal welfare. Other risk factors for poor welfare related to the housing structures are type of floor, space at the manger, number of water dispensers and lack of specific moving and handling facilities. Microclimatic conditions can be critical especially during the summer season when cattle can experience heat stress. The <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> adopted in the Italian beef farms may be another factor negatively affecting the welfare of these animals due to the low content of long fibre roughage which increases the risk of metabolic acidosis. In the veal calf rearing systems there has been a mandatory introduction of the new system of production according to the European Council Directives 91 / 629 /EEC and 97 / 2 /EC. Farms had to adopt group housing and to provide calves with an increasing amount of fibrous feed in addition to the all-liquid diet. Despite this specific legislation, several risk factors for calves' welfare can still be identified. Some of them are related to the housing system (type of floor, air quality, feed and water supply equipment and lack of loading facilities) and some others to the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> (type and amount of roughage, quality of milk replacers). Recent studies have shown that the welfare of veal calves and beef cattle can be severely affected by the quality of the stockmanship and particularly by negative human-animal interaction...|$|E
30|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed as potential mechanisms behind the benefits of CR [98]. The hormesis hypothesis suggests that CR acts as a low-intensity stressor and thus, improvements in health and longevity can result as a defense against the exposure [118]. In addition, the oxidative damage hypothesis, which is supported in the literature, suggests that CR itself achieves the same goal by decreasing oxidative stress [119, 120]. Dietary fasting {{has been shown to}} prevent atherogenesis by improving NO bioavailability [121 – 123]. The Daniel Fast [98, 110, 124] is one type of dietary fast involving a plant-based <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> that restricts intake of animal products, refined foods, white flour, preservatives, additives, sweeteners, caffeine, and alcohol. Bloomer et al. [98] reported several benefits resulting from 21  days of this ad libitum dietary intervention. Improvements of oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant status were noted which included a significant reduction in MDA, an increase in nitrate/nitrite, and a 9  % increase in Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity [98]. Also reported were improvements in blood lipids, glucose, insulin, systolic blood pressure, and body weight [98].|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} for the correct feeding {{of the horses}} is to provide them all the nutrients required to satisfy the organism’s needs and all the substances that can help to avoid metabolic problems and to use energy substrates and different nutrients sources in proper way. Many factors can influence {{the success of a}} <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> such as owner expectations, metabolic and digestive differences among horses, and stable conditions. Moreover the estimation in field conditions of nutritional requirements is usually performed by empirical way and not always estimated with care.

As a result the nutritional requirements of the horse are frequently misjudged. In particular energy expenditure for exercise is often correlated to the riders perception or horse work attitude.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{increasing}} feeding volumes for infants of {{low birth weight}} was devised by the author. It was determined by considering birth weight {{and at the same}} time subsequent daily body weight of infants. In this report results obtained by adopting our method were described. Premature infants are usually divided into several groups according to their birth weight and increase rates of feeding volumes are determined by considering only on birth weight. Therefore, increase rate of calorie uptake seems paradoxically faster in infants of low birth weight than in infants of higher birth weight. As a consequence, physiological loss of body weight is seemingly fewer and subsequent regaining seems inevitably quicker in infants of low birth weight than in those of higher birth weight. Body weight changes in premature infants of low birth weight are remarkable several weeks after birth. Such changes may correspond to that observed in 2 to 4 months old normal infants during over a month period. Therefore, it may not be appropriate method for feed them by schedules based only upon birth weight.

Forty-five patients who required intraduodenal or intrajejunal enteral feeding {{in the intensive care}} unit were randomly assigned to one of the three tube-length groups. Even the 105 -cm short feeding tubes were able to be introduced beyond the duodenojejunal junction, although insufficient tube length remained for tube fixation at the nose. The longer variants, however, were positioned significantly (p < 0. 01) deeper in the intestine, with enough spare tube length for slack formation in the stomach and fixation at the nose.

Examine and analyze the handover challenges in a local setting, and document current practice. Material and methods. Three qualitative semi structured focus group interview was conducted with 13 registered nurses to describe the current practice. Using a checklist including 23 items, the information transfer during 100 post-operative handovers was documented, and subsequently compared with patient medical records. Results. The focus group interviews indicate that sender and receiver often have different opinions about what items {{should be included in}} the verbal handover. In the observed handover situations, two items were transferred in all cases, patient name and type of surgery. Items regarding the post-operative period was transferred in only 72 % of the handovers. Items rarely transmitted were plan for lines and drains, postop investigations, antibiotic therapy, <b>feeding</b> <b>plan,</b> regular medication and patient's relatives. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that current practice in post-operative handover is incomplete. A standardized handover appears useful to optimize the handover process. Relevance. Postoperative handover involves staff across professional group and skill sets, each with their own different yet important priorities of what information must be transferred. Incomplete information transfer may have a negative impact on patient safety.

Five bulls {{were randomly selected from}} each farm to be slaughtered in the same abattoir. Bulls age was similar across treatments but the CS 44 bulls had a lower carcass weight (396 kg) than the other two treatments (436 and 446 kg for CS 0 and CS 22, respectively). Carcass fleshiness (SEUROP) and fatness scores were not affected by the level of corn silage in the diet. Meat quality was evaluated on a joint sample of the m. Longissimus thoracis, excised from the 5 th to the 9 th rib of each right half carcass 24 h post-mortem, after an ageing period of 10 d vacuum packaged at 4 °C. Meat chemical analysis showed no variations in pH, DM, intramuscular fat and protein content due to the different silage inclusion in the diet. Only the cholesterol content was progressively reduced in the meat of bulls fed increasing quantities of corn silage according to a significant negative linear trend.

40|$|Pumpkin {{provides}} a valuable source of carotenoids and ascorbic acid which have major roles in nutrition as provitamin A {{and as an}} antioxidant respectively. Carotenoids {{are a source of}} vitamin A, and β-carotene present in pumpkin is converted to vitamin A in the body. Pumpkins’ biomass is distinguished for having antioxidant and phytobiotic characteristics. The aim of our research is to analyse pumpkin fruit (Cucurbita maxima D.) flours’ influence upon calves growth, intestinal microflora, digestibility of rations’ nutrients and health. In pursuance of this aim two groups of 1 -month-old Lithuanian Black and White breeds’ heifers were constituted, 10 animals per group: control and experimental. The heifers were fed by the same <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> and grown in equal conditions. Except for experimental groups’ animals, each of them was additionally given 120 g of pumpkin fruits’ flour with their days’ ration. The results of this research showed that calves which were additionally given pumpkin fruits‘ flour had grown more rapidly. After six months of the research the weight of experimental groups‘ heifers was 9, 2 kg or 5, 34 pct. bigger than the weight of control groups‘ heifers. Pumpkin fruits‘ flour distinguished for phytobiotic activity in calves‘ intestine, it stimulated the increase of lacto- and bifidobacteria. After four months of the research there were 63, 6 pct. (P 0, 05). Morphological blood indexes of both calves groups conformed to physiologic norms and defined good animals‘ health. Moreover, with this research it was determined that heifers which were additionally given pumpkin fruits‘ flour had an increase of haemoglobin in their blood. With reference to the data of this research, we made a conclusion that pumpkin fruits‘ flour in the calves‘ ration stimulates calves‘ growth, improves digestibility of rations‘ nutrients, positively affects intestinal microflora and activates vital processes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Literature {{reflects}} that neonatal clinical practices are increasingly infant-driven, and promote, developmentally based care. Particularly, {{in the area}} of oral feeding, practitioners are moving away from traditional gestational age criteria for the initiation of oral feeding, or progressing feedings based on volume, instead they are trending toward feeding protocols that are based on developmental maturity. A statement released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2008), made the attainment of independent oral feeding one of the critical criteria for hospital discharge of preterm infants. This statement not only reflected the increased research attention on oral feeding acquisition and outcomes, it caused neonatal clinicians to seriously reconsider their methods for feeding premature infants, so that premature infants could safely acquire oral feeding prior to going home. This paper reviews and summarizes the principles and benefits of cue-based feeding that have been presented in the literature. Cue-based feeding is an outgrowth of developmentally-based care. Being increasingly used in <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> for premature infants, cue-based feeding is a feeding method, where, the infant directs how and when it will eat, by displaying behavioral cues and eating reflexes...|$|R

It will partly run within an integrated corridor with {{the second stage of}} Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline. [...] In Khabarovsk, it will be connected with the Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline. Together, these pipelines will <b>feed</b> a <b>planned</b> LNG plant, which will produce liquefied natural gas for export to Japan, and a planned petrochemical complex in Primorsky Krai. Branches toward Northern China are envisaged.|$|R
40|$|Pig {{livestock}} farming systems face {{economic and environmental}} issues. The pig fattening unit is {{responsible for most of}} the feeding cost and nutrient excretion in pig farming. Thus, optimizing the <b>feed</b> sequence <b>plans</b> of growing-finishing pigs is a way to improve the economic and environmental outputs on a commercial farm. We developed a model, called PigOptim that optimizes the <b>feed</b> sequence <b>plan</b> of a population of growing pigs. PigOptim calculates the environmental impacts of pig production by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). It optimizes the number of feeding phases, the average live weight {{at the beginning of each}} phase, the lysine supply (from 70 % to 130 % of the average requirement of the population) and the formula of each feed with a multi-objective function which integrates gross margin (GM) of the unit and its impact on Climate Change (CC). PigOptim includes response laws of growth performance issued from simulations performed with InraPorc® software for a population. For an optimization of GM only, the best results of GM and CC were obtained for a lysine supply between 90 % and 100 % of the average requirement of the population, whereas animal performance was maximized at 110 % of the average requirement. Indeed, reducing feed costs between 110 % and 90 % of the average lysine requirement compensates for the reduction in growth performance. This result highlights the interest of models accounting for animal variability when investigating economic and environmental issues. The simultaneous optimization of GM and CC led to a reduction of GM and CC, but some other environmental impacts increased. These first results suggest that PigOptim gives consistent estimations of animal performance, GM and environmental impacts. To our knowledge, PigOptim is the first model optimizing <b>feed</b> sequence <b>plan</b> on criteria calculated by LCA. In the future, PigOptim will have to include various environmental impacts in the objective function and will need an improved optimization process for further integration into a decision support system...|$|R
