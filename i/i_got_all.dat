It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because last time I commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused to pay me and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>all</b> manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!" ...|$|E

500|$|As an infant, Stone had baby colic {{and cried}} frequently; she {{consequently}} developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords {{while she was}} a child. Stone has described herself as having been [...] "loud" [...] and [...] "bossy" [...] while growing up. She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although {{she did not like}} school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that [...] "I made sure <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>all</b> As". Stone suffered panic attacks as a child, which she says caused a decline in her social skills. She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>all</b> excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>all</b> profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|Poulidor {{has several}} times {{accepted}} that {{his career was}} handicapped {{by a lack of}} ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil.
