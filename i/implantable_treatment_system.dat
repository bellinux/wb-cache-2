50|$|An active <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> for the Askam Borehole was {{proposed}} by the Earth Conservancy by 2013. As of 2014, the Earth Conservancy has been constructing, testing, and monitoring an abandoned mine drainage <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> at the Askam Borehole. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> makes use of a technology known as the Maelstrom Oxidizer, which uses electricity to blow air {{across the surface of}} the water, causing iron precipitate out of the water before the water is moved to a holding pond and then into the stream. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> is known as the Askam AMD <b>Treatment</b> <b>System</b> or the Askam <b>Treatment</b> <b>System.</b> An artificial wetland has also been used to treat the borehole's discharges. This wetland was constructed in May 1999 and has an area of 2.2 acre.|$|R

50|$|A passive <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> is {{a method}} for {{removing}} metals from acid mine drainage. There are several types of passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> each {{of which may be}} used on their own or in combination to treat effluents. The type of system selected is dependent upon the chemistry of the acid mine drainage and the flow of the discharge, as well as State and Federal regulations. Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> do not require power and are less expensive than active <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> They also require less maintenance, which is an advantage in remote locations.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} types of water <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> {{available}} for removing metals from acid mine drainage. Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are a relatively recent technology that involves using sulfate-reducing bacteria or limestone or both to neutralize acidity and precipitate metals. These systems are sometimes called “wetlands” or “bioreactors.” Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> differ from active <b>systems</b> (water <b>treatment</b> plants), which commonly use power; use more hazardous chemicals such as hydrated lime, caustic soda, or ammonia; and, are more expensive. Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are preferred for sites managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).|$|R

40|$|A pilot-scale wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> was {{specifically}} designed and constructed at Clemson University to evaluate removal of mercury, selenium, and other constituents from flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater. Specific objectives {{of this research}} were: (1) to measure performance of a pilot-scale constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> in terms of decreases in targeted constituents (Hg, Se and As) in the FGD wastewater from inflow to outflow; (2) {{to determine how the}} observed performance is achieved (both reactions and rates); and (3) to measure performance in terms of decreased bioavailability of these elements (i. e. toxicity of sediments in constructed wetlands and toxicity of outflow waters from the <b>treatment</b> <b>system).</b> Performance of the pilot-scale constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> was assessed using two criteria: anticipated NPDES permit levels and toxicity evaluations using two sentinel toxicity-testing organisms (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas). These systems performed efficiently with varied inflow simulations of FGD wastewaters removing As, Hg, and Se concentrations below NPDES permit levels and reducing the toxicity of simulated FGD wastewater after treatment with the constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Sequential extraction procedures indicated that these elements (As, Hg, and Se) were bound to residual phases within sediments of these systems, which should limit their bioavailability to aquatic biota. Sediments collected from constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were tested to observe toxicity to Hyalella azteca or Chironomus tetans. Complete survival (100 %) was observed for H. azteca in all cells of the constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> and C. tentans had an average of 91 % survival over the three treatment cells containing sediments. Survival and growth of H. azteca and C. tentans did not differ significantly between sediments from the constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> and controls. Since the sediments of the constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> are repositories for As, Hg, and Se and the bioavailability of these elements decreased after deposition, the pilot-scale constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> contributed significantly to mitigation of risks to aquatic life from these elements...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy`s Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) {{required}} <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> capacities {{for risk}} and cost calculation. Los Alamos was tasked with providing these capacities to the PEIS team. This involved understanding the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex waste, making the necessary changes to correct for problems, categorizing the waste for treatment, and determining the <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> requirements. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> requirements {{depended on the}} incoming waste, which varied for each PEIS case. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> requirements also depended {{on the type of}} treatment that was desired. Because different groups contributing to the PEIS needed specific types of results, we provided the <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> requirements in a variety of forms. In total, some 40 data files were created for the TRU cases, and for the MLLW case, there were 105 separate data files. Each data file represents one treatment case consisting of the selected waste from various sites, a selected <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> and the reporting requirements for such a case. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> requirements in their most basic form are the treatment process rates for unit operations in the desired <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> based on a 10 -year working life and 20 -year accumulation of the waste. These results were reported in cubic meters and for the MLLW case, in kilograms as well. The <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> model consisted of unit operations that are linked together. Each unit operation`s function depended on the input waste streams, waste matrix, and contaminants. Each unit operation outputs one or more waste streams whose matrix, contaminants, and volume/mass may have changed {{as a result of the}} treatment. These output streams are then routed to the appropriate unit operation for additional treatment until the output waste stream meets the treatment requirements for disposal. The total waste for each unit operation was calculated as well as the waste for each matrix treated by the unit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{estimation}} of overall on-site and off-site greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by {{wastewater treatment plants}} revealed that in anaerobic and hybrid <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> greater emissions result from off-site processes compared to on-site processes. However, in aerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> onsite processes make a higher contribution to the overall GHG emissions. The total GHG emissions were estimated to be 1. 6, 3. 3 and 3. 8 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD in the aerobic, anaerobic and hybrid <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. In the aerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> without the recovery {{and use of the}} generated biogas, the off-site GHG emissions were 0. 65 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD, accounting for 40. 2 % of the overall GHG emissions. This value changed to 2. 3 and 2. 6 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD, and accounted for 69. 9 % and 68. 1 % of the overall GHG emissions in the anaerobic and hybrid <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. The increased off-site GHG emissions in the anaerobic and hybrid <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are mainly due to material usage and energy demand in these systems. The anaerobic digester can contribute up to 100 %, 55 % and 60 % of the overall energy needs of plants in the aerobic, anaerobic and hybrid <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively.
