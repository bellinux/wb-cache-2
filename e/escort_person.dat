50|$|This {{specialist}} {{unit of the}} Metropolitan Police {{consists of}} officers {{with a range of}} skills and operational experience from various policing backgrounds. One motorcyclist (lead bike) positions himself in front of the escort, controlling the precise pace, position, speed and timing of the escort, whilst the others forge ahead, dealing with traffic situations and advising the lead bike of the safest path through the traffic they are controlling. SEG officers on Honda VFR1200F motorcycles use whistles in preference to sirens (which are not fitted). This reduces the level of noise that precedes an escort and softens the environmental impact on the <b>escorted</b> <b>person</b> and general public. Officers from The Special Escort Group are among the few police motorcyclists within the UK that carry firearms openly whilst riding. All SEG officers are Advanced Drivers, Advanced Motorcyclists and are fully trained in anti-hijack driving and firearms tactics. The SEG uses a wide range of other vehicles aside from motorcycles, including Range Rovers, and BMW 5 Series, both marked and unmarked.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} robots navigating in populated environments. Because traditional obstacle-avoidance algorithms do not differentiate between people and other objects in the environment, this thesis argues that such methods do not produce socially acceptable results. Rather, robots must detect people in the environment and obey the social conventions that people use when moving around each other, such as tending {{to the right side}} of a hallway and respecting the personal space of others. By moving in a human-like manner, a robot will cause its actions to be easily understood and appear predictable to people, which will facilitate its ability to interact with people and thus to complete its tasks. We are interested in general spatial social tasks, such as navigating through a crowded hallway, as well as more cooperative tasks, such as accompanying a person side-by-side. We propose a novel framework for representing such tasks as a series of navigational constraints. In particular, we argue that each of the following must be considered at the navigational level: the task definition, societal conventions, and efficiency optimization. This thesis provides a theoretical basis for each of these categories. We propose to validate this conceptual framework by using it to design a simple navigational algorithm that will allow a robot to move through a populated environment while observing social conventions. We will then extend this algorithm within the framework to allow a robot to <b>escort</b> a <b>person</b> side-by-side. Finally, we will examin...|$|R

50|$|Moray behaved with generosity, {{allowing}} them to depart on swearing never again to take arms against the supporters of King David. There was, besides any chivalric considerations, a political dimension to his actions. Namur {{was the subject of}} Philip VI, king of France, and the Guardian had no wish to upset Scotland's most vital ally. He even decided to <b>escort</b> Namur in <b>person</b> back towards the border. It cost him dearly. On his way back he was ambushed by an English force from Jedburgh under William Pressen. Sir William Douglas managed to escape, but his brother, James, was killed. Moray himself was taken prisoner, destined to spend the next five years in English jails. Namur returned to Berwick and sailed with Queen Philippa to join Edward at Perth. He was well received by the king, although his recent discomfiture must have been the occasion for some political embarrassment. Because of his pact with Moray the count was of no military value to Edward, and he soon left Scotland, never to return. With his reputation compromised the unfortunate Namur was severely censured by the English chroniclers for daring to enter enemy territory with so modest a following.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Tộ {{was further}} exposed to Western {{education}} by reading French language newspapers and books {{in addition to}} materials available through Chinese translation.

In more recent times, the historian Truong Ba Can demonstrated that according to the files of the Foreign Missions Society's headquarters in Paris, Gauthier definitely did not venture to France during 1859 - 60.

40|$|A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE EXPERIENCE OF ESCORT SERVICE UNDER THE ACT (SFS 1993 : 387) SUPPORT AND SERVICE FOR THE DISABLED The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{experiences}} of escort service under the Act (SFS 1993 : 387) concerning Support and Service for the disabled (LSS) for self-determination, participation and equality of living conditions. In the results of this study appears that the escort service fulfills its role in breaking the isolation of persons with disabilities. It gives a picture of the escort service is much more than to break the isolation of people with disabilities. The aspects that emerges is that <b>escort</b> service gives <b>persons</b> with disabilities the opportunity to develop their independence, increase their self-esteem and broaden their frames of reference through increased participation in community life. All users report that they experience autonomy in the choice and order of activities within their grant initiatives. The result reveals that even the escorts feel that the users have the option to be able to determine their choice of activities. When it comes to concepts of self-determination, participation and equality of living conditions there is a certain ambiguity regarding the individual's definition of the various concepts as they can be experienced and perceived differently by different individuals. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about experience of escort service.

The sixpences did indeed flow in rapidly; the advertisements had, so far, produced their effect. But the reserved seats sold very slowly. The members of the Institution, who were admitted for nothing, arrived in large numbers, and secured the best places. Towards eight o'clock (the hour at which the lecture was to begin), the sixpenny audience was still pouring in. Rufus recognised Phoebe among the late arrivals, <b>escorted</b> by a <b>person</b> in the dress of a gentleman, who was palpably a blackguard nevertheless.

A gaunt, dirty, savage old woman, miserably dressed, offered her sixpence to the moneytaker, while the two gentlemen were shaking hands; the example, it is needless to say, being set by Rufus. The old woman looked attentively at all that was visible of Mr. Farnaby--that is to say, at his eyes and his whiskers--by the gas-lamp hanging in the corridor. She instantly drew back, though she had got her ticket; waited until Mr. Farnaby had paid for his wife and himself, and then followed close behind them, into the hall.|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots that {{encounter}} {{people on}} a regular basis must react to them in some way. While traditional robot control algorithms treat all unexpected sensor readings as objects to be avoided, we argue that robots that operate around people should react socially to those people, following the same social conventions that people use around each other. This thesis presents our COMPANION framework: a Constraint-Optimizing Method for Person–Acceptable NavigatION. COMPANION is a generalized framework for representing social conventions as components of a constraint optimization problem, which is used for path planning and navigation. Social conventions, such as personal space and tending to the right, are described as mathematical cost functions that can be used by an optimal path planner. These social conventions are combined with more traditional constraints, such as minimizing distance, in a flexible way, so that additional constraints can be added easily. We present a set of constraints that specify the social task of traveling around people. We explore the implementation of this task first in simulation, where we demonstrate a robot’s behavior {{in a wide variety of}} scenarios. We also detail how a robot’s behavior can be changed by using different relative weights between the constraints or by using constraints representing different sociocultural conventions. We then explore the specific case of passing a person in a hallway, using the robot Grace. Through a user study, we show that people interpret the robot’s behavior according to human social norms, and also that people ascribe different personalities to the robot depending on its level of social behavior. In addition, we present an extension of the COMPANION framework that is able to represent joint tasks between the robot and a person. We identify the constraints necessary to represent the task of having a robot <b>escort</b> a <b>person</b> while traveling side-by-side. In simulation, we show the capability of this representation to produce behaviors such as speeding up or slowing down to travel together around corners, as well as complex maneuvers to travel through narrow chokepoints and return to a side-by-side formation. Finally, we present a newly designed robot, Companion, that is intended as a platform for general social human–robot research. Companion is a holonomic robot, able to move sideways without turning first, which we believe is an important social capability. We detail the design and capabilities of this new platform. As a whole, this thesis demonstrates both a need for, and an implementation and evaluation of, robots that navigate around people according to social norms...|$|R

Consecutive ambulatory patients referred for endoscopy under midazolam sedation with ASA I or II, <b>escorted</b> by a <b>person,</b> were eligible. Flumazenil was given on arrival in the recovery room. Patients were discharged when adequate Aldrete scores and physical mobility were present. The next day, they were contacted by telephone. A total of 1, 506 patients participated. They received 5 mg midazolam, while 887 patients also received 50 mcg fentanyl. The median dose of flumazenil was 0. 2 mg. Oxygen desaturation (sO 2 < 92 %) occurred in 15 % during the procedure without an effect on recovery and discharge times. Patients left the department 65 min after the last midazolam administration. The majority (82. 7 %) were fully alert during their journey home. At home, 2. 7 % went to bed, 45. 2 % took a nap, and 40 % undertook activities. Almost every patient (98. 8 %) liked the shortened recovery time. Three patients had an incident (fainting, fall, and near-fall) without consequences. Based on this low incidence, a non-inferiority comparison of midazolam-flumazenil with midazolam-recovery would require a total of 32, 650 patients.
