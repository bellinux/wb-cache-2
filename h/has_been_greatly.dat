This species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> affected by habitat destruction, and about 42,000 Coke's hartebeest occur today in Mara, Serengeti National Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania and Tsavo East National Park in Kenya. The population is decreasing, and 70% of the population lives in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{aggressiveness}} {{of these}} snakes <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> exaggerated. In tests {{designed to measure}} the various behavioral responses by wild specimens to encounters with people, 23 of 45 (51%) tried to escape, while 28 of 36 (78%) resorted to threat displays and other defensive tactics. Only when they were picked up with a mechanical hand were they likely to bite.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> curtailed {{due to their}} effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|Approximately 57,000 {{visitors}} come to {{the park}} each year {{for a variety of}} outdoor recreational activities. The 1978 final rule listing Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as threatened estimated that 60 percent of the habitat at Chittenango Falls was trampled by humans. Human disturbance also continues to threaten Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, although this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> minimized by fencing of the snail's habitat area at Chittenango Falls. The current strategy for recovering Novisuccinea chittenangoensis includes buffering the species against extinction by perpetuating the extant population at Chittenango Falls at a baseline size, and new attempts in maintaining multiple captive populations.|$|E

5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} by the Caliphs Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. The Caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149) made significant further changes, adding a fourth arcade with keel arches, and a dome with elaborate carved stucco decorations in front of the transept. Since then, the mosque <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> enlarged and modified over the years. Of the original building little remains other than the arcades and some of the stucco decoration.|$|E
5|$|Its {{distribution}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> {{reduced and}} is now discontinuous. Decades of poaching for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. The Guianas {{are one of the}} last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It {{is one of the most}} endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and loss is the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held.|$|E

5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>greatly</b> assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
