25|$|Adding to King Henry's {{troubles}} is the behaviour {{of his son}} and heir, the Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has forsaken the Royal Court {{to waste}} his time in taverns with low companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and calls into question his royal worthiness. Hal's chief friend and foil in living the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince.|$|E
500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it {{is fair to say}} that Plantinga has solved this problem. That <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E
500|$|John Kinnaird later {{commented on}} Hazlitt's words terming Iago [...] "an amateur of tragedy in real life", {{pointing}} out that Bradley and others after him developed the idea that Hazlitt saw Iago as an artist in his own right, [...] "a dramatic artist manqué". [...] "But the form Iago's will to 'mischief' takes is not primarily aesthetic or creative but practical and critical. Soldier that he <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a 'craving after action {{of the most difficult}} and dangerous kind,' and he has none of the artist's sympathy with pleasure; his 'licentious' bent is always 'saturnine,' and stems from 'a desire of finding out the worst side of every thing, and of proving himself an over-match for appearances' [...] ". David Bromwich later warned against carrying too far the idea that Iago is an artist figure within the play, a representation of Shakespeare himself, as Iago's [...] "genius is [...] the opposite of Shakespeare's. It presents all things in a distorting medium [...] Iago's peculiar genius is" [...] as Hazlitt represented it, [...] "the exuberance of one part of Shakespeare's mind—not an allegorical representation of the whole of it." ...|$|E

500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
500|$|Forster's {{performance}} at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 {{in his fourth}} match was highly impressive and drew plaudits from many. The Gunners dominated the match, and had 11 shots on target as opposed to Southampton's three. Forster pulled off a string of saves in what The Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "genuinely inspired goalkeeping performance". He saved twice from Mesut Özil in the first half, saving his first effort at goal with an outstretched leg then parrying his second shot, a volley from close range, away to safety. In the second half a shot from Alexis Sánchez was saved so spectacularly that Arsenal's Olivier Giroud was seen to turn towards Forster and applaud the save. A double save {{near the end of}} the match from Theo Walcott helped Southampton secure a hard fought 0–0 draw. After the match, Koeman praised his goalkeeper, hailing his performance as [...] "magic" [...] and describing him as [...] "one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League and maybe in Europe". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger also acknowledged Forster's showing, saying, [...] "He had a brilliant game." [...] Former Arsenal goalkeeper, Bob Wilson, added further praise: [...] "It was an exceptional goalkeeping display," [...] adding, [...] "Where I am admiring Fraser most <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> come back so well from a real long lay-off from a career-threatening injury... As regards who won Southampton the point it was Fraser without any doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, the {{magazine}} National Review described Thompson as pro-choice {{based in part}} on Thompson's statements from 1994 and 1997. After Thompson's office called {{to say that he was}} pro-life, National Review analyzed Thompson's voting record and declared that, [...] "Thompson is an ally of pro-lifers in all the actual fights that come up, but he's not one of them on the core issue. Unless, that <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> changed his mind, as suggested by his current self-description as a pro-lifer." ...|$|E

60|$|And now his life, if {{not more}} virtuous, was more crafty than it <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> no tutor to watch his doings and {{complain}} of them, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sufficient sense to keep himself from absolute pecuniary ruin. <b>He</b> lived, it <b>is</b> true, where sharpers and blacklegs had too often opportunities of plucking him; but, young as <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sufficiently long about the world to take care <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not openly robbed; and as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not openly robbed, his father, in a certain sense, was proud of him.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Sheldon may be asexual or aromantic. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre said: [...] "Part of what's {{wonderful}} and unique about [...] <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> chosen not {{to play in the}} relationship game either way – heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any sexuality." [...] This is referenced in [...] "The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem", when Sheldon unknowingly attracts the attention of grad student Ramona Nowitzki, and Penny, seeing this, asks his friends what his [...] "deal" [...] (i.e., sexual orientation) is, to which Leonard responds, [...] "Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no 'deal'." ...|$|E

How well I remember that first day I caught sight of Sam, it was a Sunday service in his church. I was still rather gun-shy and diffident about churches. I can still see him standing there before the lectern, and Sam's utter honesty, his tremendous forthrightness, his almost terrible sincerity struck me deep. I shall never forget it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on the colt's success, Dettori said [...] "I {{had an easy}} lead, but Jamie [...] {{was very}} clever. He {{attacked}} early, he eyeballed me, but the horse showed what a true champion he <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> a lot of guts and was going away at the end." [...] After the race Oppenheimer was reportedly keen to run the colt in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes but Gosden was cautious in outlining future plans saying [...] "a day at a time, {{a week at the}} time, the horse’ll tell me. I watch, I listen, that’s my job. It’s up to the horse". He did however, suggest that the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe could be a long-term target but added that the colt would not run if the ground was [...] "bottomless".|$|E
