5|$|Simon de Montfort {{claimed to}} be ruling in the King's name through a council of officials. However, he had {{effective}} political control over the government {{even though he was}} not himself the monarch, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> had happened in English history. Montfort successfully held a parliament in London in June 1264 to confirm new constitutional arrangements for England; four knights were summoned from each county, chosen by the county court, and were allowed to comment on general matters of state – the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> had occurred. Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory at Lewes, however, and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis.|$|E

5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|Before the match, the {{decision}} was taken to close the roof on the Millennium Stadium, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> {{had happened in the}} United Kingdom. Liverpool lined up in a 4–4–2 formation, with new signing John Arne Riise included in the team, while midfielder Steven Gerrard was absent with an ankle injury. There was also no place for striker Robbie Fowler, who was expected to captain the side. Manchester United lined up in a 4–4–1–1 formation, with Paul Scholes playing just off the main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, who made his debut for the club. Van Nistelrooy's fellow new signing, Juan Sebastián Verón, was on international duty with the Argentina national team; his place in midfield was taken by Nicky Butt.|$|E

5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after he ran into a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds reacted to the increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the right to the left. Liverpool continued to press for a winner as the half drew to a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake. Neither team managed to score before full-time and the match went to extra time, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> happened since the 1947 final.|$|E
5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of the Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised.

In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E
5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16.

O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis in opening round of the Scottish Open.|$|E
