5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet. The planet orbits <b>its</b> <b>parent</b> star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of <b>its</b> <b>parent</b> star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E

5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} {{treated as}} an {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of <b>its</b> <b>parent</b> species. Concomitantly, it takes on <b>its</b> <b>parent</b> category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.|$|E

5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from <b>its</b> <b>parent</b> species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
