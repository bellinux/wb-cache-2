40|$|Magnetic Carnot cycle {{refrigerators}} {{should be}} capable of pumping heat efficiently and inexpensively from liquid helium temperatures to liquid hydrogen temperatures. At higher temperatures, up to room temperature, Stirling cycle devices using ferromagnets are feasible. At low temperatures paramagnets absorb hundreds of joules per liter upon demagnetization; at higher temperatures, ferromagnets absorb tens of kilojoules per liter upon demagnetization. Four magnetic refrigerators have been built, but no <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>unit</b> is in operation. However, fundamental consideration indicates that magnetic refrigerators should eventually replace gas refrigerators, at least below about 80 K where lattice specific heats can be kept small...|$|E
40|$|Entrepreneurs are encountering {{a number}} of {{constraints}} pertaining to finance, marketing, technological and export for smooth running of their entrepreneurial units. Therefore, there is urgent need to provide the facilities which facilitate them setting up of <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>units</b> {{and they should be}} equipped with latest technologies and skills by organizing different entrepreneurial motivational and skill oriented programs frequently. With this background the present study was undertaken in the four industrially leading districts of Haryana state to determine the correlates which help in establishing <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> small scale agro- processing units; to determine the specific training needs of entrepreneurs who have already established their units; to make an assessment of problems encountered by entrepreneurs to facilitate setting up of sustainable units and to suggest the strategies for smooth working of small scale agro-processing units. A total number of 120 entrepreneurs who were running their agro-processing units were constituted the sample for the study...|$|R
