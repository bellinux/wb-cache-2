40|$|Butterfly wing color {{patterns}} often contain eyespots, {{which are}} developmentally determined at the late larval and early pupal stages by organizing activities of focal cells that can later form eyespot foci.

Here, we examined the possible relationships of the pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> with the underneath pupal wing tissues and with the adult wing eyespots using Junonia butterflies. Large pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> were found in two species with large adult eyespots, J. orithya and J. almana, whereas only small pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> were found in a species with small adult eyespots, J. hedonia. The size of five pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> on a single wing was correlated {{with the size of}} the corresponding adult eyespots in J. orithya. A pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was a three-dimensional bulge of cuticle surface, and the underside of the major pupal <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> exhibited a hollowed cuticle in a pupal case.

40|$|RESOLFT {{microscopy}} {{has been}} the first method {{that is capable of}} non-invasively resolving three dimensional structures with real subdiffraction resolution using visible light. It exploits the strong nonlinear saturation of a reversible optical transition. A focal intensity pattern is essential that de-excites or de-activates dyes outside the remaining ultrasharp <b>effective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>spot.</b> For a given amount of available power, the steepest applied de-excitation pattern will yield the highest resolution. In this thesis, for the first time, a comprehensive search, optimization and characterization of de-excitation patterns is performed. The microscope’s pupil function is decomposed into orthonormal polynomials which allows the restriction of the space of pupil functions so that boundary conditions are fulfilled. The chosen global optimization algorithm converges reasonably well to pupil functions that can be idealized further to simple shapes. Optimal pupil functions are found according to assumptions made about the practical limitations. The optimization identified a novel, superior de-excitation pattern for circularly polarized light. Its experimental application has led to a hitherto unrivaled lateral resolution of down to 20 nm in biological systems. It is shown that an efficient resolution increase in all spatial directions is only possible by incoherent combinations of de-excitation beams. The optimal choice for current experimental conditions is identified. Finally, a new concept for fast acquisition of high resolution images is developed that is based on the simultaneous creation of compact arrays of sub-diffraction sized fluorescence spots in the sample. An optical setup that can generate the corresponding complex pupil functions is detailed...|$|E
30|$|FE {{sources have}} the {{potential}} for extremely high spatial modulation. By controlling, the electron emitter location at the nanoscale, coarse control over the position of the electron beam, and subsequent X-ray beam are possible. A range of focussing techniques has also been developed to reduce the electron beam focal spot size. Standard X-ray tubes have a focal spot size of typically around 1  mm diameter. For greater spatial resolution, “mini-focus” X-ray tubes have been developed, with a spot size down to 50  μm, as well as “micro focus” X-ray tubes with a spot size of ~ 5  μm [227]. Almost exclusively, X-ray sources with <b>effective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes of < 10  μm, which are commercially available, employ electrostatic or magnetic focussing and require high beam current pulsing techniques, to prevent limitation in their imaging resolution by motion-induced blurring [206]. The size of the electron beam at its source and latterly as it impacts the target material, contributes, in part, {{to the size of the}} X-ray focal spot, which itself impacts on the resolution of the resultant X-ray image. A large electron beam focal spot will create a penumbra effect where the X-ray spot subtends a significant angle at the subject; this blurs the resultant image. Conventional X-ray tubes will use a lensing cup around the heated filament assembly. This, to a first order, electrostatically focuses the electrons onto the centre of the anode. Careful design of the cathode and supporting electrostatic lenses will minimise the size of the focal spot [228, 229]. Additionally, further electrostatic rings or focussing coils may also be employed to redirect the flow of electrons emanating from the cathode, to further reduce the spot size, where the focal spot size is determined by measuring the Point Spread Function using standard methods [230].|$|E
40|$|Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is {{a limited}} angle {{computed}} tomography technique that can distinguish tumors from its overlying breast tissues and has potentials for detection of cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage. Current prototype DBT scanners {{are based on the}} regular full-field digital mammography systems and require partial isocentric motion of an x-ray tube over certain angular range to record the projection views. This prolongs the scanning time and, in turn, degrades the imaging quality due to motion blur. To mitigate the above limitations, the concept of a stationary DBT (s-DBT) scanner has been recently proposed based on the newly developed spatially distributed multibeam field emission x-ray (MBFEX) source technique using the carbon nanotube. The {{purpose of this article is}} to evaluate the performance of the 25 -beam MBFEX source array that has been designed and fabricated for the s-DBT system. The s-DBT system records all the projection images by electronically activating the multiple x-ray beams from different viewing angles without any mechanical motion. The configuration of the MBFEX source is close to the published values from the Siemens Mammomat system. The key issues including the x-ray flux, focal spot size, spatial resolution, scanning time, beam-to-beam consistency, and reliability are evaluated using the standard procedures. In this article, the authors describe the design and performance of a distributed x-ray source array specifically designed for the s-DBT system. They evaluate the emission current, current variation, lifetime, and focal spot sizes of the source array. An emission current of up to 18 mA was obtained at 0. 5 × 0. 3 mm <b>effective</b> <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size. The experimentally measured focal spot sizes are comparable to that of a typical commercial mammography tube without motion blurring. Trade-off between the system spatial resolution, x-ray flux, and scanning time are also discussed. Projection images of a breast phantom were collected using the x-ray source array from 25 different viewing angles without motion. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed s-DBT scanner. The technology has the potential to increase the resolution and reduce the imaging time for DBT. With the present design of 25 views, they demonstrated experimentally the feasibility of achieving 11 s scanning time at full detector resolution with 0. 5 × 0. 3 mm source resolution without motion blur. The flexibility in configuration of the x-ray source array will also allow system designers to consider imaging geometries that are difficult to achieve with the conventional single-source rotating approach...|$|E
40|$|The <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} is often {{considered to have}} a fully stable position. In practice, however, the beam control loop of a linear accelerator needs to stabilize after the beam is turned on. As a result, some motion of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> might occur during the start-up phase of irradiation. When acquiring portal images, this motion will affect the projected position of anatomy and field edges, especially when low exposures are used. In this paper, {{the motion of the}} <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> and the effect of this motion on portal image analysis are quantified. A slightly tilted narrow slit phantom was placed at the isocenter of several linear accelerators and images were acquired (3. 5 frames per second) by means of an amorphous silicon flat panel imager positioned approximately 0. 7 m below the isocenter. The motion of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was determined by converting the tilted slit images to subpixel accurate line spread functions. The error in portal image analysis due to <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> motionwas estimated by a subtraction of the relative displacement of the projected slit from the relative displacement of the field edges.

40|$|Purpose: The {{quality of}} a {{radiography}} system is affected by several factors, a major one being the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size of the x-ray tube. In fact, the measurement of such size is recognized to be of primary importance during acceptance tests and image quality evaluations of clinical radiography systems. The most common device providing {{an image of the}} <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> emission distribution is a pin-hole camera, which requires a high tube loading in order to produce a measurable signal. This work introduces an alternative technique to obtain an image of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot,</b> through the processing of a single radiograph of a simple test object, acquired with a suitable magnification. Methods: The radiograph of a magnified sharp edge is a well-established method to evaluate the extension of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> profile along the direction perpendicular to the edge. From a single radiograph of a circular x-ray absorber, it is possible to extract simultaneously the radial profiles of several sharp edges with different orientations. The authors propose a technique that allows to obtain an image of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> through the processing of these radial profiles by means of a pseudo-CT reconstruction technique. In order to validate this technique, the reconstruction has been applied to the simulated radiographs of an ideal disk-shaped absorber, generated by various simulated <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> distributions. Furthermore, the method has been applied to the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of a commercially available mammography unit. Results: In the case of simulated radiographs, the results of the reconstructions have been compared to the original distributions, showing an excellent agreement for what regards both the overall distribution and the full width at half maximum measurements. In the case of the experimental test, the method allowed to obtain images of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> that have been compared with the results obtained through standard techniques, namely, pin-hole camera and slit camera. Conclusions: The method was proven to be effective for simulated images and the results of the experimental test suggest that it could be considered as an alternative technique for <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> distribution evaluation. The method offers the possibility to measure the actual <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size and emission distribution at the same exposure conditions as clinical routine, avoiding high tube loading {{as in the case of}} the pin-hole imaging technique...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} a new method based on a coded aperture mask combined with a digital x-ray imaging detector for measurements of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes of diagnostic x-ray tubes. Common techniques for <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size measurements employ a pinhole camera, a slit camera, or a star resolution pattern. The coded aperture mask is a radiation collimator consisting of a large number of apertures disposed on a predetermined grid in an array, through which the radiation source is imaged onto a digital x-ray detector. The method of the coded mask camera allows one to obtain a one-shot accurate and direct measurement of the two dimensions of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> (like that for a pinhole camera) but at a low tube loading (like that for a slit camera). A large number of small apertures in the coded mask operate as a ???multipinhole??? with greater efficiency than a single pinhole, but keeping the resolution of a single pinhole. Methods: X-ray images result from the multiplexed output on the detector image plane of such a multiple aperture array, and the image of the source is digitally reconstructed with a deconvolution algorithm. Images of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of a laboratory x-ray tube (W anode: 35 ??? 80 kVp; <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size of 0. 04 mm) were acquired at different geometrical magnifications with two different types of digital detector (a photon counting hybrid silicon pixel detector with 0. 055 mm pitch and a flat panel CMOS digital detector with 0. 05 mm pitch) using a high resolution coded mask (type no-two-holes-touching modified uniformly redundant array) with 480 0. 07 mm apertures, designed for imaging at energies below 35 keV. Measurements with a slit camera were performed for comparison. A test with a pinhole camera and with the coded mask on a computed radiography mammography unit with 0. 3 mm <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> was also carried out. Results: The full width at half maximum <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes were obtained from the line profiles of the decoded images, showing a <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of 0. 120 ???mm× 0. 105 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 6. 1, with a detector entrance exposure as low as 1. 82 mR (0. 125 mA???s tube load). The slit camera indicated a <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of 0. 112 ???mm× 0. 104 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 3. 15, with an exposure at the detector of 72 mR. <b>Focal</b> <b>spot</b> measurements with the coded mask could be performed up to 80 kVp. Tolerance to angular misalignment with the reference beam up to 7 ° in in-plane rotations and 1 ° deg in out-of-plane rotations was observed. The axial distance of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> from the coded mask could also be determined. It is possible to determine the beam intensity via measurement of the intensity of the decoded image of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> and via a calibration procedure. Conclusions: Coded aperture masks coupled to a digital area detector produce precise determinations of the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> of an x-ray tube with reduced tube loading and measurement time, coupled to a large tolerance in the alignment of the mask...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{adaptive}} optics {{system has been}} developed, implemented and evaluated at the Lund High Power Laser facility, Atomic Physics Division, Lund Institute of Technology. The laser system delivers ultrashort pulses with peak powers exceeding 40 TW at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The pulses are focused to achieve extreme irradiance exceeding 1019 W/cm 2. In order to increase the peak intensity at the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> {{it is possible to}} either increase the pulse energy, to reduce the pulse length or to make the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> smaller. Cost and the laser bandwidth put limits to the two first alternatives. This thesis explores the third option. The aim for this project was to investigate the abilities of an adaptive optics system to precompensate for alignment or intrinsic optical errors that would degrade the focusing power of the laser system. A test system, using a smaller deformable mirror than required for the main laser system was developed and implemented by the author and comprise a deformable mirror, a detection system and an optimization algorithm. The deformable mirror was a Micromachined Membrane Deformable Mirror (MMDM), it had 37 electrostatic actuators and was coated with gold. The detection system measured the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> peak intensity and the mirror shape was optimized by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Heavily astigmatic foci were routinely corrected and the MMDM was used to precompensate for the astigmatic errors introduced by off-axis focusing with a spherical mirror. At an off-axis angle of 17 o, the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size was improved from 6. 5 to 1. 3 times the diffraction limit. When the laser was focused with a well aligned parabolic mirror, the algorithm and the deformable mirror were still able to increase the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> peak intensity by 85 %. The deformable mirror was also used to manipulate the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> intensity profile. Multiple <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> of equal intensity were successfully generated from a single beam and a scheme that would allow tailored <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> was tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of lithotripters {{over the past}} 20 years has lead {{to the production of}} lithotripters with smaller focal zones (diameters 4 - 8 mm) than the first generation lithotripters (∼ 12 mm diameters) and with higher peak pressures (∼ 100 MPa compared to ∼ 40 MPa). At first glance it may seem beneficial to focus the acoustic energy more tightly onto the stone however clinical reports suggest that the narrower focal zones have poorer outcomes and more side effects. Here the impact of <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size on energy delivered to stones and the intensity delivered to tissue is considered by numerical modeling. It is shown that lithotripters with <b>focal</b> <b>spots</b> much larger than a stone are able to deliver similar energy to a stone as a narrow high pressure <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> lithotripter. The reduction of energy delivered to the stone is exacerbated in the presence of motion. The larger <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> lithotripters result in reduced incident intensity to the tissue. These results suggest that wide <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> lithotripters have the potential to adequately fragment stones with a lower risk of side effects. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
