50|$|The {{process of}} joining the IAEA is fairly simple. Normally, a State would notify the Director General of its desire to join, and the Director would submit the {{application}} to the Board for consideration. If the Board recommends approval, and the General Conference approves the application for membership, the State must then submit its instrument of acceptance of the IAEA Statute to the United States, which functions as the <b>depositary</b> <b>Government</b> for the IAEA Statute. The State is considered a member when its acceptance letter is deposited. The United States then informs the IAEA, which notifies other IAEA Member States. Signature and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are not preconditions {{for membership in the}} IAEA.|$|E

50|$|The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals -- more {{commonly}} abbreviated {{to just the}} Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) or the Bonn Convention -- aims to conserve terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout their range. It is an international treaty, concluded {{under the aegis of}} the United Nations Environment Programme, concerned with the conservation of wildlife and habitats on a global scale. Since the Convention's entry into force, its membership has grown steadily to include over 120 Parties from Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Europe and Oceania. The Convention was signed in 1979 in Bad Godesberg, a suburb of Bonn (hence the name), and entered into force in 1983. The <b>depositary</b> is the <b>government</b> of the Federal Republic of Germany.|$|R
25|$|Each ADR {{is issued}} by a {{domestic}} custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited {{in a foreign}} depositary bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent {{a fraction of a}} share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK <b>government.</b> <b>Depositary</b> banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.|$|R
50|$|Upon the law school’s {{move from}} DeLand to Gulfport in 1954, the library {{collection}} {{also had to}} be moved. The new house for the law library consisted of “several small cubicles” {{and at the time}} “all the law books ‘fit into one moving van.’” The collection contained less than 18,000 books. In 1955, an anonymous donor pledged $250,000 to assist in paying {{for the creation of a}} new law library and classroom building. Within one year, the law school was able to raise the money to match the anonymous donation and met its $750,000 goal. It became known that the anonymous donor was Charles A. Dana and the Charles A. Dana Foundation. Construction on the new Charles A. Dana Library began in 1957. Students and staff transferred the small law library collection from the original location on the Gulfport campus to the new library in less than thirty minutes. This new library included space to expand the collection (housing for 70,000 volumes) and study space for 100 students. In 1958, the Charles A. Dana Law Library opened. The dedication of the library, made in the presence of Charles A. Dana, included a convocation by Florida’s Governor, LeRoy Collins. The Charles A. Dana Foundation provided a gift in 1971 for the purpose of doubling the law library’s size. The school completed the expansion in 1973 and provided space for 275 students and 160,000 volumes. During this time, the Charles A. Dana Library also became “the first law library in Florida to be a <b>depositary</b> for Federal <b>Government</b> documents.” By 1981, the library’s collection contained more than 165,182 volumes.|$|R
