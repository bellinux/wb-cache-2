500|$|Gervase Hughes concludes his {{chapter on}} Sullivan's orchestration: [...] "n this vitally {{important}} {{sector of the}} composer's art <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> rank as a master." [...] Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and a technically highly skilled orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect. Percy Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: [...] "Sullivan never asked his players {{to do what was}} either uncongenial or impracticable." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Fred Thomas of AllMusic complimented them for disposing of the introspective material which appeared on prior albums and choosing to [...] "accentuate all the throbbing rhythms, metallic guitars and bilious disgust that defined the band's best work." [...] He went on to suggest that Born Villain could pave the way for future releases. Reviewing for Classic Rock, Mick Farren – who was cynical of the hype the album was receiving – said [...] "to my delight as a closet fan, Born Villain turns out to be little short of excellent", praising its emphasis on [...] "bone-crunching rhythm". A review for Blabbermouth said that several tracks were likely to be considered classics among the band's discography. The Ottawa Sun complimented the album's lyrical themes, saying that it saw Manson [...] " [...] like the slasher-flick antihero <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy praised the album for being more fun than previous work, while Gary Graff from Billboard applauded it for containing a wide variety of moods and styles.|$|E

2500|$|Pullman has {{singled out}} certain {{elements}} of Christianity for criticism, {{as in the}} following: [...] "I suppose technically, you'd have to put me down as an agnostic. But {{if there is a}} God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be put down and rebelled against".

2500|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his absence, Louch’s career went into {{overdrive}} on his return and <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be described as ubiquitous for the sheer volume of his appearances at every venue imaginable from 1787 until his final retirement {{at the end of the}} 1797 season. [...] In all, he has 134 recorded appearances in major matches. [...] Only the Earl of Winchilsea (128) and William Bullen (119) were anywhere near his total when he retired.|$|E
2500|$|Blackmun {{has been}} noted {{for the fact that}} {{compared}} to other Justices on the Supreme Court, he had let his law clerks utilize great latitude as far as writing opinions for him, such as his opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was written by Stephanie Dangel, now a lawyer in Pennsylvania. Blackmun's Casey opinion draft included sharp criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist, which included, according to Dangel, a sarcastic reference to Rehnquist as [...] "The Chief" [...] rather than Chief Justice because [...] "I have my doubts as to whether <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be called 'justice' on this one." [...] Dangel, however, changed it to [...] "Chief Justice" [...] at the urging of Justice Anthony Kennedy.|$|E
5000|$|... "I can't help {{thinking}} about how many people {{that he may have}} killed later, how many of my friends, how many Marines. He messed up and <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> die. That still bothers me." ...|$|R

2500|$|Though Pullman {{has stated}} he is [...] "a Church of England atheist, and a 1662 Book of Common Prayer atheist, because that’s the {{tradition}} I {{was brought up}} in”, he has also said he is technically an agnostic. He has singled out elements of Christianity for criticism: [...] "if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be put down and rebelled against." [...] However, {{he said that his}} argument can extend to all religions. Pullman has also referred to himself as knowingly [...] "of the Devil's party", a reference to William Blake's revisionist view of Milton in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Pullman is a supporter of Humanists UK and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. [...] In 2011 he was given a services to Humanism award by the British Humanist Association for his contribution as a longstanding supporter.|$|E
2500|$|Cesare Borgia's remains {{then were}} sent to Viana's town hall, {{directly}} across from Santa María, where they remained until 1953. They were then reburied immediately outside of the Church of Santa María, no longer under the street and in direct danger of being stepped on. A memorial stone was placed over it which, translated into English, declared Borgia the Generalisimo of the papal {{as well as the}} Navarrese forces. A movement was made in the late 80s to have Borgia dug up once more and put back into Santa María, but this proposal was ultimately rejected by church officials due to recent ruling against the interment of anyone who did not hold the title of pope or cardinal. Since Borgia had renounced the cardinalate it was decided that it would be inappropriate for his bones to be moved into the church. However, Fernando Sebastián Aguilar, the Archbishop of Pamplona, caved in after more than 50 years of petitions and Borgia was finally moved back inside the church on 11 March 2007, the day before the 500th anniversary of his death. [...] "We have nothing against the transfer of his remains. Whatever he may have done in life, <b>he</b> <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> be forgiven now," [...] said the local church.|$|E
