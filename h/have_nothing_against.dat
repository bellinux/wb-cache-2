500|$|Masked {{protesters in}} Seattle, Washington, United States congregated {{in front of}} the Church of Scientology of Washington. Protesters were quoted as saying, [...] "We believe in total freedom of belief. We <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the people of Scientology, however the Church of Scientology has {{committed}} crimes. They're vehemently anti-opposition. Anyone who opposes them, must go down." [...] A protester in Santa Barbara emphasized that their opposition was against the organization, not the belief system, and that they supported the Scientology split-off group known as the Free Zone. Protesters turned out in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania despite unusually cold weather. The masked crowd consisted mainly of college students, including some who had travelled from as far as Penn State University.|$|E
500|$|Following the competition, former {{national}} team captain Lilian Thuram stated that Evra {{should be banned}} permanently from playing for the national team. His sentiments were later echoed by Sports Minister Chantal Jouanno, who declared, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Evra but, as a France player and especially captain, he did not defend the values of sport which are shared by the Republic. I am sure there exist other talents who have not sullied France and {{are waiting for the}} chance to write new history". On 6 August, Evra was one of five players summoned to attend a hearing held by the Disciplinary Committee of the FFF in response to the team's strike at the World Cup. On 17 August, he received a five-match international ban for his part in the incident.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{the songs}} from the album explore social issues. The songs [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lush" [...] and [...] "Too Famous" [...] use satire to criticise the {{superior}} attitudes of male musicians, while [...] "Husband" [...] disapproves [...] "gruff and pushy" [...] boyfriends. The band also clarified that they <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Negatively, Mika was {{included}} in Complexs list of the [...] "lamest" [...] Street Fighter characters, reasoning [...] "Street Fighter has never been shy with the gorgeous ladies, but they've always had full-figured back stories {{to go along with}} their full-figured backsides. Rainbow Mika on the other hand is the most blatant example of mysogynistic [...] character design seen in the series." [...] Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network declared Mika as [...] "the worst Street Fighter character," [...] reasoning [...] "every little detail about her annoyed me, from the stupid boob-hearts on her costume to the way she whomped opponents with her butt—and rubbed it after she hit the ground." [...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against,</b> er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E

2500|$|Gigi Becali, {{known for}} his {{repeated}} homophobic comments at previous LGBT events, stated, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> them, but why they make a parade, I don’t understand. Let them meet in the park, 300, 500 of them, to make a show. I would <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> it, but a parade, propaganda? It is abnormal." [...] Becali, {{who is also the}} president of the Steaua football club, stated that he doesn't want any more homosexuals coming to Ghencea Stadium, but later appeared to contradict himself by saying [...] "Discrimination? It's discrimination if I don't let them come. Where's the discrimination?" [...] The National Council for Combating Discrimination announced that it will be investigating if Becali's comments breach Romania's anti-discrimination laws, which also cover speech. In a later interview, however, Becali declared, [...] "I love them [...] {{in the same way that}} I love all other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don't have a place.|$|E
2500|$|A November 8, 2004, cartoon {{depicted}} {{mentally disabled}} children as classroom teachers {{in an attempt}} to make an analogy to American voters who reelected Bush, drawing complaints from advocates for the disabled and led to his cartoons being dropped from The Washington Posts website. Rall responded in his blog saying: [...] "I regret hurting people who I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against.</b> I do want to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, and I think I failed in that with this cartoon. Not to mention that the cartoon failed—too many people got bogged down in the analogy and the main point got lost." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 November, Eritrea's {{envoy to}} Nairobi Beyene Russom {{told the press}} that his {{government}} had no objections vis-a-vis Operation Linda Nchi. He blamed the allegations that Eritrea was supplying weapons to Al-Shabaab on lack of due diligence {{on the part of}} the media. Russom also accused Ethiopia, stating that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Kenya. This piling up of accusations is the work, as we believe, of Ethiopia to camouflage its illegal military occupation of Eritrean territory. What is being said now about the planeload of weapons to Al-Shabaab again we believe is a creation of Ethiopia." [...] With regard to Wetangula's warning that the Kenyan government would sever ties, Russom indicated that Asmara believed the Kenyan authorities were acting on false information. Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed is scheduled to arrive in Nairobi for talks on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Cesare Borgia's remains {{then were}} sent to Viana's town hall, {{directly}} across from Santa María, where they remained until 1953. They were then reburied immediately outside of the Church of Santa María, no longer under the street and in direct danger of being stepped on. A memorial stone was placed over it which, translated into English, declared Borgia the Generalisimo of the papal {{as well as the}} Navarrese forces. A movement was made in the late 80s to have Borgia dug up once more and put back into Santa María, but this proposal was ultimately rejected by church officials due to recent ruling against the interment of anyone who did not hold the title of pope or cardinal. Since Borgia had renounced the cardinalate it was decided that it would be inappropriate for his bones to be moved into the church. However, Fernando Sebastián Aguilar, the Archbishop of Pamplona, caved in after more than 50 years of petitions and Borgia was finally moved back inside the church on 11 March 2007, the day before the 500th anniversary of his death. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the transfer of his remains. Whatever he may have done in life, he deserves to be forgiven now," [...] said the local church.|$|E
