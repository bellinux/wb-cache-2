40|$|I got several {{comments}} from my audience {{to the effect}} that the story on the invention of real bills and discounting has only historical interest, and hardly any relevance to contemporary affairs. Actually, if the world is ever to return to a gold standard, we have to understand how it worked in the past. My researches show that economists have not succeeded in explaining its operation. They approached the issue from the position of mercantilism and from that of the Quantity Theory of Money. For example, theyexplained the adjustment mechanism governing foreign trade in terms of the international gold standard as follows. A country running a trade surplus is gaining gold while another running a deficit is losing it. The money supply of the surplus country grows, and that of the <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> contracts. Other things being the same, there will be an increase in the price level in the surplus and a decrease in the <b>deficit</b> <b>country.</b> In the absence of trade barriers the surplus country will export less and import more, while the <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> will export more and import less. This process will continue until the trade surplus/deficit disappears. International gold flows tend to reestablish equilibrium in the foreign trade accounts of gold standard countries, through their effect on the price level. So goes the argument. However, the available trade statistics show that this was not at all what was happening. International gold flows were negligible, and they were moved by other factors than payment for net imports. In fact, the adjustment mechanism worked not on the relative price levels, but on the discount rates of the trading countries. We must have a new theory of foreign trade, purged from the influence of mercantilism and the Quantity Theory of Money. In these Lectures I intend to develop this new theory of the gold standard in terms of the Real Bills Doctrine. Let us now return to The Secon...|$|R

5000|$|Each item {{a member}} country {{exported}} would add bancors to its ICB account, and each item it imported would subtract bancors. Limits would {{be imposed on}} the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought, and {{on the amount of}} bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold.

For chronic creditors, it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits, rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits, to the ICB's Reserve Fund.
