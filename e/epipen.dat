5|$|Claire goes on {{a miserable}} double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan (Travis Schuldt), and his ill-mannered friend Benny (Bailey Chase). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear {{as if she had}} {{requested}} this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's <b>EpiPen.</b> Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an <b>EpiPen</b> or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick {{go inside}} while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy {{attack from the}} peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by {{stabbing}} him with an <b>EpiPen.</b> Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E
50|$|As of September 2016, two <b>EpiPens</b> cost around $100 in France {{and around}} $200 in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, Manchin was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when USA Today, a national newspaper, published an article noting that Manchin, upon becoming Board of Education president in 2012, spearheaded a campaign for states to require schools to purchase <b>EpiPens</b> and other medical supplies. Eleven states created laws to require schools to stock <b>EpiPens,</b> made by Mylan pharmaceuticals, leading to a [...] "near monopoly" [...] of Mylin's epinephrine autoinjector in the school health sector. The article noted the potential for a conflict of interest, as Mylin's CEO, Heather Bresch, is Manchin's daughter.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Mylan {{launched}} {{a program called}} EpiPen4Schools to sell <b>EpiPens</b> in bulk and with discounts to schools; {{to participate in the}} program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An <b>EpiPen</b> or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
25|$|Workers with {{a history}} of severe {{allergic}} reactions to insect bites or stings should consider carrying an epinephrine auto injector (<b>EpiPen)</b> and should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace stating their allergy.|$|E
500|$|Noah binds and gags Vicky {{with duct}} tape and uses an audio {{recording}} of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky's dead body, with her throat having been slashed by Noah. A horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he says his mother wasn't {{the woman in the}} crash. [...] His mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett, having freed himself, attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noah's eye with Kevin's <b>EpiPen.</b> When Noah removes the <b>EpiPen</b> from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death, she then jams her thumb into the same damaged eye to blind him further, much to Noah's agony and he strikes her across the face. When he later holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a switch that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as the police arrive. Garrett is put in an ambulance. A paramedic says that Garrett will be fine. Claire and Kevin ride in the ambulance with him and Claire tells Garrett that he's gonna be okay and promises him after he arrives at the hospital, [...] "we're going home.", hinting at a family reconciliation between Claire, Garrett and Kevin. As all three family members remain together in the ambulance, the ambulance then drives off into road to the hospital and the camera pans out to the moon hovering in the night sky.|$|E
50|$|The Corps {{maintains}} three {{fully equipped}} BLS ambulances. The vehicles are type III ambulances. These vehicles are rotated through for {{the day-to-day operations}} of the Corps. These vehicles carry AEDs, oxygen, glucose, epinephrine auto injectors (more commonly known as <b>EpiPens),</b> bandaging and splinting supplies, and transportation equipment. The three ambulances carry fleet numbers 172, 429, and 868, however these vehicles are all marked as 134, the Corps' radio call sign.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{constant}} threat of bioterrorist related events, {{there is an}} urgent need to develop pulmonary protective and reparative agents {{that can be used}} by first responders in a mass casualty setting. Use in such a setting would require administration via a convenient route for e.g. intramuscular via <b>epipens.</b> Other feasible routes of administration could be inhalation and perhaps to a lesser extent oral – swallowing can be difficult in many forms of injury especially if accompanied by secretions or if victim is nauseous. A number of in vitro and in vivo models lend themselves to preclinical evaluation of novel pulmonary therapies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alternate}} products {{expected to}} most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the <b>EpiPens</b> made by Mylan in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada. Mylan already had an 85% {{market share of}} the auto-injectors in the US {{in the first half}} of 2015. Maylan is expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of November 2, 2015: [...] ".... it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," [...] Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on November 3, 2015.|$|R
2500|$|The {{scope of}} medical {{practice}} for EMTs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among {{states as well}} as inside states. In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, glucose testing using a glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the <b>EpiPen.</b> EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Mylan {{acquired}} {{the right to}} market the <b>EpiPen</b> from Merck KGaA {{as part of a}} larger transaction. At that time annual sales were around $200 million and the <b>EpiPen</b> had about 90% of the market.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EpiPen,</b> {{manufactured}} by King, {{a subsidiary of}} Pfizer, and marketed by Mylan, has dominated the market.

5000|$|In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the <b>EpiPen,</b> an {{epinephrine}} autoinjector, became {{controversial and}} was widely {{referred to as}} [...] "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the <b>EpiPen</b> under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the [...] "outsized compensation" [...] of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a [...] "$98 million" [...] 2016 [...] "pay package" [...] {{in spite of the}} [...] "harm to the company inflicted by the <b>EpiPen</b> controversies" [...] and [...] "steep shareholder losses."
