5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from the college.|$|E

The terrain is level.|$|R
5|$|The Alban Goldsmith House was {{constructed}} sometime prior to 1820. The story-and-a-half brick edifice is laid in common bond with a Flemish bond facade on the front. Three gabled windows {{were added to}} the facade many years after its construction. Interior chimneys with corbels on top adorn each end of the house. It faces west onto Second Street, away from Constitution Square, and opposite the Ephraim McDowell <b>House</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evergreen Terrace {{is holding}} a street-wide rummage sale in Springfield. As Homer dances on tables selling items, there is a diversion: the empty <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> is being moved into. It is {{occupied}} by former President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara. Bart decides to visit, and Barbara takes a liking to him, but his overall rebellious attitude annoys George. Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men vow to make trouble for each other.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from {{the house to the}} prison. Berkman had been given access to {{a large portion of the}} prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
50|$|In July 1994 the Harbor Department {{granted a}} {{revocable}} permit to the L.A.

5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his residency in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has held a state-issued medical license since moving there in 1993. He received {{his first job}} from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after {{completing his}} residency. Paul worked for Downing {{for about five years}} before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000. His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals. Paul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants. As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} shot was fired, {{witnesses}} saw a man, later {{believed to be}} James Earl Ray, fleeing from a rooming <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from the Lorraine Motel. Ray had been renting a room there. Police found a package dumped close to the site, which included a rifle and binoculars, both with Ray's fingerprints.

25|$|Near {{the end of}} May, during Operation Rainbow, the Israeli army {{demolished}} {{a building}} {{across the street from the}} home of Ibrahim Hammad, one of the perpetrators of the attack on the Hatuel family. According to a neighbor, residents had already left the area on the assumption that Hammad's house would be demolished. According to Human Rights Watch, Hammad's house was not harmed but a <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> belonging to Mahmoud Abu Arab was bulldozed instead. Abu Arab submitted a claim for compensation from the Israeli authorities.|$|E

25|$|By the 1830s tanneries, {{leather goods}} factories, {{carriage}} factories and blacksmith shops were active around Morice Mill Pond (renamed recently to Silver Lake) a few kilometres {{north of the}} current town centre. The centre of activity started to shift to the present downtown area when in 1836 William Crane moved his business {{to the site of}} the former town hall, and built his <b>house</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> He also donated land for a small Methodist chapel that was built in 1838 and later evolved into the much larger Sackville Methodist/United Church. In 1839, Charles Frederick Allison donated money and land to establish the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy, which became Mount Allison University. This was followed by the development of shipyards on the Tantramar River. Official records for shipbuilding in New Brunswick began in 1824, but by that time shipbuilding was already well under way with several ships of over 100 tons having been built.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, President Harry S. Truman was {{residing}} in Blair House while the White <b>House,</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House {{with the intent}} to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm German Luger to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. , Coffelt is {{the only member of the}} Secret Service killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the abdomen but made a full recovery). Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979.|$|E
