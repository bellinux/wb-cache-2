Our steel works, as everybody knows, are now idle because we have no work to do there. Until the reduction of ten per cent on the 10th of this month {{there has been no}} reduction in your wages for nearly a year, while during that time there has been a falling off in the prices we get for iron and steel of over twenty-five per cent. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> consider these things fully and reflect whether the little work we can give you is not better than no work at all. I assure you when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in proportion.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Dwyer went to {{his press}} conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21 page {{prepared}} text later described as a [...] "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer spoke out {{against the death penalty}} and expressed regret for voting in favor of it {{while he was in the}} Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, [...] "Those of you who are putting your cameras away, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> stay because we're not, we're not finished yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> know," [...] Chatterton {{answered}} dryly. [...] "Women {{generally have}} {{a finger in}} it whenever there is trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could, dear, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought.</b> May <b>I</b> speak quite freely, {{and will}} you {{remember}} that it's Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--That perhaps," [...] I went on, [...] "you will excuse my boldness on that account. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> most seriously to {{know that}} Richard is poorer than he was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to say what will suit eccentric persons," [...] she answered, [...] "but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him with neglect." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{how do you}} {{reconcile}} such marriages as I speak of, {{with the}} spirit of Christ's teaching? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> answer me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Necessity," [...] I proceeded. [...] "My {{stock of}} money is decreasing, and I don't know how to {{replenish}} it. My pictures have been turned out of the exhibition-rooms; nobody comes to sit to me; I can't make a farthing; and I must try another line in the Arts, or leave your studio. We are old friends now. I've paid you honestly week by week; {{and if you can}} oblige me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought.</b> <b>You</b> earn money somehow. Why can't I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> to,' Mr. Hawtrey said {{somewhat}} sharply, 'considering that he {{has done}} what all the detectives in London have failed to do, even aided by the police all over the Continent, and has gone a long way towards lifting a cloud, which, {{if it had not been}} for him, would have darkened your whole life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> {{not to pay}} such marked {{attention}} to Lady Gladys. Two or three times I have fancied I noticed it, and have meant to mention it to you, but I {{thought it might be}} unnecessary. On many accounts, however, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is best not to let it pass any longer. The difference of station----" ...|$|R
