25|$|The 2007 Energy White Paper: Meeting the <b>Energy</b> <b>Challenge</b> was {{published}} on May 23, 2007. It contained a 'preliminary {{view is that}} it is in the public interest to give the private sector the option of investing in new nuclear power stations'. Alongside the White Paper the Government published a consultation document, The Future of Nuclear Power together with a number of supporting documents. One of these, a report by Jackson Consulting, suggested that it would be preferable to site new power stations on existing nuclear power stations sites that are owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority or British Energy.|$|E
25|$|If the AMPK {{response}} to exercise is responsible {{in part for}} biochemical adaptations to training, how then can these adaptations to training be maintained if the AMPK {{response to}} exercise is being attenuated with training? It is hypothesized that these adaptive roles to training are maintained by AMPK activity and that the increases in AMPK activity in response to exercise in trained skeletal muscle {{have not yet been}} observed due to biochemical adaptations that the training itself stimulated in the muscle tissue to reduce the metabolic need for AMPK activation. In other words, due to previous adaptations to training, AMPK will not be activated, and further adaptation will not occur, until the intracellular ATP levels become depleted from an even higher intensity <b>energy</b> <b>challenge</b> than prior to those previous adaptations.|$|E

40|$|China s forest {{bioenergy}} {{policies are}} evolving {{against the backdrop}} of pressing national <b>energy</b> <b>challenges</b> similar to those faced by OECD countries, and chronic rural <b>energy</b> <b>challenges</b> more characteristic of developing countries. Modern forest bioenergy could contribute to solutions to both of these challenges. However, because of limitations in current technologies and institutions, significant policy and resource commitments would be required to make breakthroughs in either commercializing forest bioenergy or modernizing rural energy systems in China. Given the potential attention, funding, and resource trade-offs between these two goals, we provide an argument for why the focus of China s forest bioenergy policy should initially be on addressing rural <b>energy</b> <b>challenges.</b> The paper concludes with a discussion on strategies for laying the groundwork for a modern, biomass-based energy infrastructure in rural China...|$|R
