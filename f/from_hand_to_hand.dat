The Georgian army put up a stubborn fight {{in defense of the}} approaches to the capital, which they held for a week in the face of overwhelming Red Army superiority. From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> in heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, bowed to the inevitable and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction. The Georgian government and the Constituent Assembly evacuated to Kutaisi in western Georgia, which dealt the Georgian army a significant moral blow.|$|E

500|$|Tracing is {{a process}} that allows for the {{recovery}} of property (such as land or money) by the owner if it is taken involuntarily, and the owner has not consented to the transfer of title. This can be through theft, breach of trust, or mistake. Owners can recover their property and perhaps also any profits made from it, or in situations where the property cannot be recovered (as it has been mixed in with other property, or cannot be found), substitute property. The process has two steps, following and tracing. In Foskett v McKeown, Lord Millett defined them by saying that [...] " [...] are both exercises in locating assets which may or may be taken to represent an asset belonging to the [...] and to which they assert ownership. The process of following and tracing are, however, distinct. Following is the process of following the same asset as it moves <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand.</b> Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as the substitute for the old". Following, therefore, is simply establishing who the original owner of property is, where that property is, and returning it to the original owner. Tracing arises when the property cannot be returned and the court is asked to recognise an interest in new property, such as whatever the defendant received in exchange for the claimant's original property. Tracing can occur at both the common law and equity. It is not a remedy for breach of trust; tracing is merely the process of identifying the property. It is then up to the courts to decide what will happen to it.|$|E

To investigate this coordination, we focused on the transition <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> opening <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> closing in the grasping component of prehension. Earlier research has suggested that the time taken <b>to</b> close the <b>hand</b> remains constant over varying reaching amplitudes. In the present experiment, in which subjects reached for objects at six different distances and for objects that moved away from them at three different, constant speeds, hand-closure time was found to vary as a function of experimental conditions. Moreover, initiation of hand closure did not occur at a constant value of the (perceptually available) first-order time remaining until contact with the object. However, the variations observed, occurring as a function of initial hand-object distance and object speed, could be accounted for by an abstract dynamical model of perceptually driven postural changes...|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, {{prior to}} 1737 the {{economic}} motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take {{of the third}} night of a play. This {{could be a very}} large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, John Gay grew wealthy with The Beggar's Opera. In 1726, Leonard Welsted's indifferent success, The Dissembled Woman, was acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights. [...] After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more. [...] From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act. [...] Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass <b>from</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand,</b> and spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Weyl {{semimetal}} (WSM) {{is expected}} to be an ideal spintronic material owing to its spin currents carried by the bulk and surface states with spin-momentum locking. A photocurrent generation in noncentrosymmetric WSM was also predicted owing to its broken inversion symmetry and linear energy dispersion which are unique to Weyl systems. In our recent measurements, the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) has been demonstrated in WSM of TaAs. The CPGE voltage is proportional to the helicity of the incident light and reverses its direction on changing the radiation helicity <b>from</b> left <b>handed</b> <b>to</b> right <b>handed,</b> a periodical oscillation therefore appears following with the alteration of optical polarization.
