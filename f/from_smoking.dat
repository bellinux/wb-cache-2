5|$|After {{recognizing}} {{the harmful effects}} of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on smoking. Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> while they were on duty. Smoking was also outlawed in schools.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained <b>from</b> <b>smoking,</b> gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons given}} by some smokers for this {{activity}} have been categorized as addictive smoking, pleasure <b>from</b> <b>smoking,</b> tension reduction/relaxation, social smoking, stimulation, habit/automatism, and handling.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} a role {{of education to}} acquire a healthy lifestyle (health education) in achieving a smokeless society, the relationship between attitudes toward {{the legal right to}} be free <b>from</b> involuntary <b>smoking</b> in public places, based on human rights, and personal health practices was determined using answers to a questionnaire from 887 randomly-selected citizens of Osaka. The answers were analyzed within four subgroups of respondents divided by smoking status and sex. Among the respondents, three significant relationships of attitude scores to health practices were identified. Within subgroups of female subjects, questionnaire attitude scores decreased as health practice scores increased. Among male non-smokers, those who had high health practice scores also had high attitude scores. Among male smokers, there was no statistical association between health practice scores and attitude scores. Our results demonstrated that attitudes toward the legal right to be free <b>from</b> involuntary <b>smoking</b> among male-nonsmokers were closely related to personal health practices, and implied the effectiveness of health education among this subgroup for the advancement of their legal right to be free <b>from</b> involuntary <b>smoking.</b> legal right to be free <b>from</b> involuntary <b>smoking</b> personal health practices lifestyle...|$|R

25|$|Cigarettes contain polonium-210, {{originating}} from the decay products of radon, which stick to tobacco leaves. Heavy smoking {{results in a}} radiation dose of 160 mSv/year to localized spots at the bifurcations of segmental bronchi in the lungs from the decay of polonium-210. This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> is delivered to a very {{small portion of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} countries, {{people who}} smoke tobacco products, {{or who are}} exposed to second-hand smoke, {{are among the most}} highly exposed groups; tobacco smoke contributes to 90% of indoor PAH levels in the homes of smokers. For the general population in developed countries, the diet is otherwise the dominant source of PAH exposure, particularly <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> or grilling meat or consuming PAHs deposited on plant foods, especially broad-leafed vegetables, during growth. PAHs are typically at low concentrations in drinking water.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal from heavy, chronic {{cannabis}} use {{does not}} usually exceed 3–4 days, {{but it has}} the potential to be psychologically addictive.

Bladder cancer diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas, and efforts to control schistosomiasis in Egypt have led to decreases in the bladder cancer rate. The risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers, perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it {{to be exposed to}} carcinogens <b>from</b> <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originating in the 1930s, {{this myth}} {{was the basis}} for films like Reefer Madness, and used by Harry Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics as {{justification}} for outlawing cannabis. The allegation was that even the calmest, most normal person could be transformed into a psychopathic killer or rapist solely <b>from</b> <b>smoking</b> a joint. No relationship has ever been proven linking such crimes to the acute intoxication of cannabis alone, and cannabis' psychological effects tend to be more associated with pacifism and inactivity than with aggression. For example, studies of the Jamaican working class showed no difference in the crime rates between users and the non-user of cannabis.|$|E
