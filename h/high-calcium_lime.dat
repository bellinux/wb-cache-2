His successor, chosen on July 1, 1913, was Ralph H. Sweetser, who held largely opposite views. Sweetser modernized not only No. 1 and No. 3 stacks at Hokendauqua, but the old No. 7 stack at Alburtis. He also attempted to restart local limonite mining, an effort which proved a costly failure. By 1915, No. 6 stack at Hokendauqua had been abandoned (leaving only No. 1 and No. 3 in operation there).

50|$|The {{theoretical}} heat (the standard enthalpy) {{of reaction}} {{required to make}} <b>high-calcium</b> <b>lime</b> is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple shaft kilns, similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current shaft kilns. Modern variants include regenerative and annular kilns. Output is usually in the range 100-500 tonnes per day.|$|E

40|$|Based upon a {{scientific}} {{understanding of the}} reasons different properties develop, slaked lime putty, aged slaked lime putty (which undergoes time-dependent changes upon storage in water) and putty from hydrated lime (i. e., soaked dry hydrate) are discussed, along with mortars made with them. The results of recent research on lime mortars are reviewed and interpreted focusing on the implications for the appropriate or inappropriate use of <b>high-calcium</b> <b>lime</b> mortar types in architectural conservation. The nanostructure and irreversible colloid nature of calcium hydroxide crystals in slaked lime putty, which determine the desirable working properties of putties, such as plasticity, density and viscosity, are modified through crystal coarsening triggered by drying. These properties are not fully regained upon subsequent reintroduction of water (e. g., putty preparation with hydrated lime such as commercially available dry powder). The calcium hydroxide crystals in slaked lime putty may be further modified upon storage in water for extended time periods, also affecting the working properties and density. The nature of the crystals also influences the carbonation, and development of porosity and compressive strength of the mortar. Additionally, the results of tri-axial compressive strength testing, as opposed to uni-axial compression, suggest that the limited strength of <b>high-calcium</b> <b>lime</b> mortar contributes to the durability of masonry. status: publishe...|$|E

Lime was added at rates of 1, 3, 10 and 16 percent, chlorides were added at 0. 5 percent rate only. Speciments were compacted using vibratory compaction apparatus and {{were tested in}} triaxial compression using lateral pressures from 10 to 100 psi. Triaxial test results indicate that: (1) sodium chloride slightly decreased the {{angle of internal friction}} and increased cohesion, (2) calcium chloride slightly increased the angle of internal friction and decreased cohesion, and (3) lime had no appreciable effect on angle of internal friction but increased cohesion, decreased density and increased pore water pressure...|$|E

Their physical, mechanical strength and durability properties, raw material compositions can play significant roles in structural behaviour of historic buildings. Their production technologies may be also different according to their specific use in the structural layout. Therefore, the characteristics of lime mortars are of particular interest {{in the evaluation of}} structural characteristics of the historic buildings. Besides, determination of characteristics of the lime mortars is also important for the production of intervention mortars {{to be used in the}} restoration of historic buildings. In this study, lime mortars used in the walls and domes of some historic Ottoman baths in Seferihisar-Urla region near İzmir were analyzed in order to understand their characteristics for the purpose of conservation of these buildings. It is also aimed to investigate characteristics of the lime mortars in relation to their specific use in the structural elements of the walls and domes. Therefore, several laboratory studies were carried out on the collected mortar samples. Their basic physical and mechanical properties, raw material compositions, pozzolanic activity of aggregates used in the mortars, soluble salts in the mortars, their mineralogical and chemical compositions, and microstructural and hydraulic properties were determined. In addition, basic physical properties and pozzolanic activity of bricks used in the construction of domes were also determined in order to evaluate their contribution to the structural stability of the domes. Stone masonry mortars used in the walls and brick masonry mortars used in the domes of the Ottoman baths are lime mortars. Lime ratios of the stone masonry mortars are relatively higher than those of the brick masonry mortars. Some differences have been identified in the aggregates used in the mortars. Particle size distributions of the aggregates used in each mortar are almost the same. Fine aggregates used in each mortar have similar mineralogical and chemical compositions with their coarse aggregates. However, the fine aggregates have higher pozzolanic activity than their coarse aggregates due to high contents of amorphous materials, silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide in their compositions. Either of <b>high-calcium</b> <b>lime</b> and lime containing silica at high ratios was used as binding material in the stone and brick masonry mortars. All brick masonry mortars and some of the stone masonry mortars have hydraulic properties owing to the use of pozzolanic aggregates and lime containing silica at high ratios. These pozzolanic aggregates have good adhesion with the lime used in these mortars. Hydraulic lime mortars used in all domes have higher mechanical strength properties than non-hydraulic lime mortars used in the walls built of stone. Such differences in the stone and brick masonry mortars have been explained with a mortar technology developed consciously in relation to the difference in structural behaviour of the wall and dome. Even though the bricks used in the domes have poor pozzolanicity, they are tightly adhered to the lime mortar. This contributes to the structural strength of the domes. All these results indicate a lime mortar technology developed according to the use of the lime mortars in structural layout and its traditional character peculiar to the Ottoman baths in Seferihisar-Urla region. The first part of the study defines its subject and aim, limits and method. The second part deals with the subject of lime mortars in respect to their general characteristics and production process. In the third part, method of the study composed of sampling and experimental study is presented. In the fourth part, the results of the experimental studies are evaluated and discussed in respect to results of the related studies in the literature. The fifth part is devoted to the conclusions of the study...|$|E
