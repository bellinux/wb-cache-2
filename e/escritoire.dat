500|$|To {{the south}} of the Long Hall is the Dining Room, which is little changed since the Tudor era. [...] Its {{contents}} include a 16th-century refectory table, an oak <b>escritoire</b> from about 1650, and items of Wedgwood majolica ware made in about 1830. [...] The Dining Room leads to the small Guard Room, which contains two 17th-century chairs and an 18th-century blunderbuss. [...] To the west of this is the Drawing Room, the principal living room of the hall which has been little altered since the middle of the 16thcentury. [...] To {{the south of}} the Drawing Room is a small room known as the Gold Room. [...] This room has retained a frieze dating from the early 16thcentury, including carvings of Tudor roses, flowers and birds. [...] Also in the room is a bust of Charles Gerard. [...] In the southeast corner of the hall is the Green Room. [...] This contains a painting of Gawsworth Rectory by Charles Tattershall Dodd, and a complete set of a dinner service by Minton, comprising 120pieces.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} empty little drawer with a sigh, and shut {{and locked the}} <b>escritoire,</b> {{and came back to}} the solitary fireside.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed through}} the hall and the small oak parlour, on the table of which stood the three {{tumblers}} and the empty rum-bottle which had served for Sir Pitt's carouse, and through that apartment into Sir Pitt's study, where they found Miss Horrocks, of the guilty ribbons, with a wild air, trying at the presses and <b>escritoires</b> {{with a bunch of}} keys. She dropped them with a scream of terror, as little Mrs. Bute's eyes flashed out at her from under her black calash.|$|R
60|$|The {{ponderous}} portal obeyed {{the signal}} of the bell, and apparently opened without any human means; and Captain Armine, proceeding down a dark yet capacious passage, opened a door, which invited him by an inscription on ground glass that assured {{him he was}} entering the counting-house. Here several clerks, ensconced within lofty walls of the darkest and dullest mahogany, were busily employed; yet one advanced to an aperture in this fortification and accepted the card which the visitor offered him. The clerk surveyed the ticket with a peculiar glance; and then, begging the visitor to be seated, disappeared. He was not long absent, but soon invited Ferdinand to follow him. Captain Armine was ushered up a noble staircase, and into a saloon that once was splendid. The ceiling was richly carved, and there still might be detected the remains of its once gorgeous embellishment in the faint forms of faded deities and the traces of murky gilding. The walls of this apartment were crowded with pictures, arranged, however, with little regard to taste, effect, or style. A sprawling copy of Titian's Venus flanked a somewhat prim peeress by Hoppner; a landscape that smacked of Gainsborough was the companion of a dauby moonlight, that must have figured in the last exhibition; and insipid Roman matrons by Hamilton, and stiff English heroes by Northcote, contrasted with a vast quantity of second-rate delineations of the orgies of Dutch boors and portraits of favourite racers and fancy dogs. The room was crowded with ugly furniture of all kinds, very solid, and chiefly of mahogany; among which were not less than three <b>escritoires,</b> {{to say nothing of}} the huge horsehair sofas. A sideboard of Babylonian proportions was crowned by three massive and enormous silver salvers, and immense branch candlesticks of the same precious metal, and a china punch-bowl which might have suited the dwarf in Brobdignag. The floor was covered with a faded Turkey carpet. But amid all this solid splendour there were certain intimations of feminine elegance in the veil of finely-cut pink paper which covered the nakedness of the empty but highly-polished fire-place, and in the hand-screens, which were profusely ornamented with ribbon of the same hue, and one of which afforded a most accurate if not picturesque view of Margate, while the other glowed with a huge wreath of cabbage-roses and jonquils.|$|R
60|$|The Professor {{hesitated for}} a moment. Then he slowly crossed the room, opened the drawer of a small <b>escritoire,</b> and drew out a letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "'All is discovered,' he said; 'here is my signet ring, go at {{once and}} get the child, and make your way with it to Scotland; take {{all the money in}} the <b>escritoire,</b> quick!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The long lashes of {{the maiden}} played quickly above their dark organs, and then, conquering {{feelings}} that were strangely in contradiction to each other, {{she said with}} dignity, turning to a little ebony <b>Ã©scritoire</b> which lay beside her dressing-box-- ...|$|E
6000|$|As they wandered back to {{the gate}} to watch the furniture-man Gertie tried to regain the superiority due her years by remarking, of a large <b>escritoire</b> which was being juggled into the front door, [...] "My papa bought that desk in Chicago----" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had been}} married but a few months when our visit to them {{commenced}} during which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of money which Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father's <b>Escritoire,</b> {{a few days before}} his union with Sophia.|$|E
6000|$|She {{stared at}} him fixedly, and he {{returned}} the look with an evil smile. So they sat in silence a moment. Then slowly she arose and moved to her <b>escritoire,</b> drawing {{a sheet of paper}} toward her and beginning to write. [...] "Is there a telephone at the place?" [...] enquired Mershone abruptly.|$|E
60|$|But on the {{threshold}} she paused. Milor was sitting at a gigantic <b>escritoire</b> placed squarely {{in front of the}} window. He had obviously been writing; at the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish of Lydie's skirts, he raised his head from his work and turned to look at her.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning, in court, I heard Harold's cross-examination. He {{described}} {{exactly where}} {{he had found the}} contested will in his uncle's <b>escritoire.</b> The cross-eyed Q.C., a heavy man with bloated features and a bulbous nose, begged him, with one fat uplifted forefinger, to be very careful. How did he know where to look for it? ...|$|E
60|$|Alured knew I should forgive him, {{and he took}} my {{key from}} my basket, {{unlocked}} the <b>escritoire,</b> and gave him my purse of household money, undid the shutters, and helped Perrault to squeeze himself through the little parlour window; and then, as he said, something came over him, and he just reached the sofa, and knew no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} one I cannot find, though I had both on the <b>escritoire</b> in my own room this morning. I cannot believe anyone would touch it. I did not lock them away, not expecting to have any use for them; but I am quite sure, the last time I saw them, they were lying there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold {{wrote me}} from London {{that all was}} going well. He had found the will which I drew up at Florence in his uncle's <b>escritoire,</b> and {{everything}} was left to him; but he trusted, {{in spite of this}} untoward circumstance, long absence might have altered my determination. 'Dear Lois,' he wrote, 'I expect you to come back to England and marry me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There it is, though,' said Mr. Levison, very quietly. 'You know, Captin, {{there is}} the arrears on that 'ere annuity, three years next Michaelmas. I think it's Michaelmas; let me see.' So saying, Mr. Levison opened an <b>escritoire,</b> and brought forward an awful-looking volume, and, {{consulting}} the terrible index, turned to the fatal name of Armine. 'Yes! three years next Michaelmas, Captin.' ...|$|E
60|$|Merchants on 'change {{seem the}} {{passengers}} that buzz on her decks, while, from quarters unseen, comes a murmur as of bees in the comb. Fine promenades, domed saloons, long galleries, sunny balconies, confidential passages, bridal chambers, state-rooms plenty as pigeon-holes, and out-of-the-way retreats like secret drawers in an <b>escritoire,</b> present like facilities for publicity or privacy. Auctioneer or coiner, with equal ease, might somewhere here drive his trade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay! If {{you doubt}} me, my good Stainville----" [...] And M. Joseph rose with slow and solemn majesty from the divan, {{where he had}} been reclining, and walking across the room with a {{measured}} step, he reached an <b>escritoire</b> whereon ink and pens, letters tied up in bundles, loose papers, and all the usual paraphernalia commonly found on the desk of a busy man. M. Joseph {{sat down at the table}} and rang a handbell.|$|E
60|$|He took a {{bunch of}} keys from his pocket, singled out by the candle-light the key he wanted, and then, with a candle in his hand, went to a bureau or <b>escritoire,</b> {{unlocked}} it, touched the spring of a little secret drawer, and took from it an ordinary ring-case made for a single ring. With this in his hand, {{he returned to his}} chair. As he held it up for the young man to see, his hand trembled.|$|E
60|$|Sit {{right down}} at the {{handsome}} carved mahogany <b>escritoire</b> and shoot us in a line telling us just what you want, {{and if we can}} find it we'll come hopping down your lane with the good tidings, and if we can't, we won't bother you. To save your time, just fill out the blank enclosed. On request will also send blank regarding store properties in Floral Heights, Silver Grove, Linton, Bellevue, and all East Side residential districts.|$|E
60|$|The funeral {{had taken}} place. Depressed, yet {{resolved}} in his demeanour, Owen Graye sat before his father's private <b>escritoire,</b> engaged in turning out and unfolding a heterogeneous collection of papers--forbidding and inharmonious {{to the eye}} at all times--most of all to one {{under the influence of}} a great grief. Laminae of white paper tied with twine were indiscriminately intermixed with other white papers bounded by black edges--these with blue foolscap wrapped round with crude red tape.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Warrington {{thought that}} there was no cause why he should tell his aunt how {{intimate}} he was with her early history, and accordingly held his peace upon that point. When their meal was over, she pointed with her cane to her <b>escritoire,</b> and bade her attendant bring the letter which lay under the inkstand there; and George, recognising the superscription, of course knew the letter to be that of which he had been the bearer from home.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} room cowed, like a beaten dog. She returned, set the lamp silently on the table, and was gone. Then he noticed a letter, which lay on the <b>escritoire,</b> and was {{addressed}} to him. It was a rather peculiar letter to look at, or rather the envelope was peculiar; for, though bordered with heavy black, it was stamped, where the seal should have been, with a strange device in gold and colors--a brown bun, in a glory of gilt rays.|$|E
6000|$|I religiously obeyed his {{instructions}} {{with regard to}} the papers in the <b>escritoire,</b> and burned them in a heap without looking into one, though sorely tempted. But the old journal I kept. Perhaps in strict conscience I ought also to have burned that; but casting my eye over some half-torn leaves the other day, I could not resist an impulse to give some fragments of it to the public. To do this satisfactorily, I am obliged to twist this thread, so as to string together into a semblance of order my Oberon's [...] "random pearls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Charleworth? Well, {{perhaps she}} will {{return it to}} me. I know the lady {{slightly}} and will explain that I {{did not wish to}} part with it." [...] Still his eyes were roving around the room, and his interest in the chair seemed somewhat perfunctory. [...] "The other piece of furniture was a sort of <b>escritoire,</b> set on a square pedestal that had a carved base of lions' feet." [...] His voice had grown eager now, although he strove to render it calm, and there was a ring of anxiety in his words.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{cruel to}} see the {{enjoyment}} {{he got out of}} teasing this woman by an ironical jargon which mystified her into madness. This time he went too far. With an inarticulate snarl of passion she lifted a knife that lay on the dining-room table and made for him. But this time, being prepared, he was not alarmed; nay, he seemed to take leasure in the success of his plan of tormenting. The heavy <b>escritoire</b> at which he sat was a breastwork between him and the angry woman. He coolly opened a drawer; produced a revolver, and remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{last day}} of my holiday I was obliged, of course, to devote to Mrs. Hoggarty. My aunt was {{excessively}} gracious; and {{by way of a}} treat brought out a couple of bottles of the black currant, of which she made me drink the greater part. At night when all the ladies assembled at her party had gone off with their pattens and their maids, Mrs. Hoggarty, who had made a signal to me to stay, first blew out three of the wax candles in the drawing-room, and taking the fourth in her hand, went and unlocked her <b>escritoire.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{one side}} of the room stood an <b>escritoire,</b> and from a lower drawer therein he took out a small box tightly nailed down. He forced the cover with the poker. The box {{contained}} a variety of odds and ends, which Pierston had thrown into it from time to time in past years for future sorting--an intention that he had never carried out. From the melancholy mass of papers, faded photographs, seals, diaries, withered flowers, and such like, Jocelyn drew a little portrait, one taken on glass in the primitive days of photography, and framed with tinsel in the commonest way.|$|E
60|$|Flat-dwellers shall indorse my dictum that {{theirs is}} the only true happiness. If a home is happy it cannot fit too close--let the dresser {{collapse}} and become a billiard table; let the mantel turn to a rowing machine, the <b>escritoire</b> to a spare bedchamber, the washstand to an upright piano; let the four walls come together, if they will, so you and your Delia are between. But if home be the other kind, let it be wide and long--enter you at the Golden Gate, hang your hat on Hatteras, your cape on Cape Horn and go out by the Labrador.|$|E
60|$|We {{followed}} her through winding paths bordered by shrubs and flowers, and presently {{came to a}} low house surrounded by a wide, cool gallery, and shaded by spreading trees. Behind it were clustered the kitchens and quarters of the house servants. Mademoiselle, picking up her dress, ran up the steps ahead of us {{and turned to the}} left in the hall into a darkened parlor. The floor was bare, save for a few mats, and in the corner was a massive <b>escritoire</b> of mahogany with carved feet, and there were tables and chairs of a like pattern. It was a room of more distinction than I had seen since I had been in Charlestown, and reflected the solidity of its owners.|$|E
6000|$|A {{sensation}} of being pleasantly accepted warmed {{him as she}} cried, [...] "So glad----" [...] and introduced him, gave him tea and a cake with nuts in it. From a wing-chair Carl searched {{the room and the}} people. There were two paintings--a pale night sea and an arching Japanese bridge under slanting rain, both imaginative and well-done. There was a mahogany <b>escritoire,</b> which might have been stiff but was made human by scattered papers on the great blotter and books crammed into the shelves. Other books were heaped on a table as though people had been reading them. Later he found how amazingly they were assorted--the latest novel of Robert Chambers beside H. G. Wells's First and Last Things; a dusty expensive book on Italian sculpture near a cheap reprint of Dodo.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{grand old}} line, major, a sublime old line, and {{deserves to be}} mourned for, almost royally; almost imperially, I may say. Er--Lady Gwendolen--but she's gone; never mind; I wanted my Peerage; I'll fetch it myself, presently, and show you {{a thing or two}} that will give you a realizing idea of what our house is. I've been glancing through Burke, and I find that of William the Conqueror's sixty-four natural ah-- my dear, would you mind getting me that book? It's on the <b>escritoire</b> in our boudoir. Yes, as I was saying, there's only St. Albans, Buccleugh and Grafton ahead of us on the list--all the rest of the British nobility are in {{procession}} behind us. Ah, thanks, my lady. Now then, we turn to William, and we find--letter for XYZ? Oh, splendid--when'd you get it?" ...|$|E
60|$|I was astounded. The Prefect {{appeared}} absolutely thunder-stricken. For some {{minutes he}} remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up {{and signed a}} check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it {{across the table to}} Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an <b>escritoire,</b> took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Esmond, {{forced to}} be quiet, betook himself to {{literature}} for a relaxation, and composed his comedy, whereof the prompter's copy lieth in my walnut <b>escritoire,</b> sealed up and docketed, [...] "The Faithful Fool, a Comedy, as it was performed by her Majesty's Servants." [...] 'Twas a very sentimental piece; and Mr. Steele, who had more {{of that kind of}} sentiment than Mr. Addison, admired it, whilst the other rather sneered at the performance; though he owned that, here and there, it contained some pretty strokes. He was bringing out his own play of [...] "Cato" [...] at the time, the blaze of which quite extinguished Esmond's farthing candle; and his name was never put to the piece, which was printed as by a Person of Quality. Only nine copies were sold, though Mr. Dennis, the great critic, praised it, and said 'twas a work of great merit; and Colonel Esmond had the whole impression burned one day in a rage, by Jack Lockwood, his man.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hayes's keen eye {{had noted}} the subtle shade of {{distinction}} and admission. But {{he said nothing}} openly. 'Well, then, Higginson forged, and Lord Southminster accepted, a false will, which purported to be Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's. Now, follow me clearly. That will {{could not have been}} put into the <b>escritoire</b> during Mr. Ashurst's life, for there would have been risk of his discovering it. It must, therefore, have been put there afterward. The moment he was dead, you, or somebody else with your consent and connivance, slipped it into the escritoire; and you afterwards showed Mr. Tillington the place where you had set it or seen it set, leading him to believe it was Mr. Ashurst's will, and so involved him in all this trouble. Note that that was a felonious act. We accuse you of felony. Do you mean to confess, and give evidence on our behalf, or will you force me to send for a policeman to arrest you?' ...|$|E
