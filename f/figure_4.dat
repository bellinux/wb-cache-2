5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As shown in <b>figure</b> <b>4,</b> after an atomic exchange event the adatom {{has taken the}} place of a surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E

30|$|The visual {{assessment}} of the processed images (<b>Figures</b> <b>4</b> and 5 e) shows that the fusion-based method enhances the local and global details in the image with negligible saturation and over-enhancement problems. The proposed method also produces a minimum change in the global outlook. It can be noticed that histogram-based methods HE (<b>Figures</b> <b>4</b> and 5 c) and CLAHE (<b>Figures</b> <b>4</b> and 5 b) produce significant colour shift {{in many areas of}} the images. The HE method results in saturation and over-enhancement reducing the details. In the CLAHE method, the local details are better enhanced than HE; however, the image looks unnatural. The imadjust method (<b>Figures</b> <b>4</b> and 5 d) does not provide any significant contrast enhancement but retains the image outlook and does not result in over-enhancement, colour shift or saturation. The fused image (<b>Figures</b> <b>4</b> and 5 e) gives better local and global detail enhancement; it suppresses the over-enhancement and saturation problem while retaining the brightness or the outlook of the image.|$|R

25|$|Hedgehog has {{roles in}} larval body segment {{development}} and in formation of adult appendages. During {{the formation of}} body segments in the developing Drosophila embryo, stripes of cells that synthesize the transcription factor engrailed can also express the cell-to-cell signaling protein Hedgehog (green in <b>Figure</b> <b>4).</b> Hedgehog is not free to move very far from the cells that make it and so it only activates a thin stripe of cells adjacent to the engrailed-expressing cells. When acting in this local fashion, hedgehog works as a paracrine factor. Only cells {{to one side of}} the engrailed-expressing cells are competent to respond to Hedgehog following interaction of Hh with the receptor protein Patched (blue in <b>Figure</b> <b>4).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Duality Principle, or De Morgan's laws, can be {{understood}} as asserting that complementing all three ports of an AND gate converts it to an OR gate and vice versa, as shown in <b>Figure</b> <b>4</b> below.

25|$|Most CB1 antagonists {{reported}} so far {{are close}} analogs or isosteres of rimonabant. A general CB1 inverse agonist pharmacophore model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (<b>Figure</b> <b>4).</b> This pharmacophore contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. pyrazole in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic lipophilic part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In <b>Figure</b> <b>4</b> rimonabant is used as an example. Unit A represents a 4-chlorophenyl group and unit B a 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring. Unit C is the central pyrazole ring and unit D represents the carbonyl group which serves as the hydrogen bond acceptor. Unit E represents a lipophilic aminopiperidinyl moiety.|$|E

25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see <b>figure</b> <b>4)</b> provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in <b>figure</b> <b>4),</b> differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

25|$|In {{tests of}} the ability to {{discriminate}} between two sounds with varying VOT values but having a constant VOT distance from each other (20 ms for instance), listeners are likely to perform at chance level if both sounds fall within the same category and at nearly 100% level if each sound falls in a different category (see the blue discrimination curve in <b>Figure</b> <b>4).</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{inactive}} state of CB1 rimonabant binds within the transmembrane-3-4-5-6 aromatic microdomain.
