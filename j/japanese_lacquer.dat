50|$|The {{processed}} form (in {{which the}} lacquer is stirred continuously until {{much of the}} water content has evaporated) is called guangqi (光漆) in Chinese but comes under many different Japanese names depending on the variation, for example, kijiro-urushi (木地呂漆) is standard transparent lacquer sometimes used with pigments and roiro-urushi (黒呂色漆) is the same but pre-mixed with iron hydroxide to produce a black coloured lacquer. Nashiji-urushi (梨子地漆) is the transparent lacquer but mixed with gamboge to create an even clearer lacquer and is especially used for the sprinkled-gold technique. These lacquers are generally used for the middle layers. <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquers</b> of this type are generally used for the top layers and are prefixed by the word jo- (上) which means 'top (layer)'.|$|R

He bought carved ivory figures, <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquered</b> boxes, silk, brocades, and sword guards. Typically his purchases were impulsive, numerous, and deeply personal. Both H.O. and Louisine had distinct tastes for art collecting that largely complemented each other. Both H.O. and Louisine {{had to be in}} agreement as to an object's worth for it to enter their now legendary collection. Louisine focused on collecting modern works by European painters, including the then-unappreciated Impressionists. She was most influenced by her close friend Mary Cassatt, who encouraged her to buy works by Edgar Degas and Claude Monet. Louisine would make 33 transatlantic crossings, returning from each major trip with a bounty of great western art.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This section {{contains}} a comprehensive description of {{different styles of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquering.</b> Tools and equipment are discussed fully. The collection, refining and use of lacquer (urushi) are included, as are recipes {{for most of the}} materials used at the three different stages of the work (preparation, lacquering, finishing). This is followed by a thorough explanation of the techniques used in several different styles of lacquering. Since this is a chemical process there are some trouble areas, such as allergies to urushi that do not arise with such crafts as woodworking. The nurishi may also be responsible for cleaning and repair of the butsudan some 50 years after it was made. The artisan’s workload is described in order to explain both the wide-ranging skills involved and the shift of emphasis from making new butsudan to cleaning old ones in our modern world. The table of contents gives a detailed list of what is included in this section. Many diagrams and photos are included to augment the text...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work addresses the material properties and behaviour of <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquers</b> (urushi) coatings {{similar to those found}} on the Mazarin Chest, an important Japanese lacquerware artefact currently displayed in the Toshiba Gallery of Japanese Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London. For almost four centuries, the Mazarin Chest has been displayed in uncontrolled environmental conditions and has been exposed to a range of lighting conditions. As a result, the Mazarin Chest has deteriorated and started to suffer from different kinds of damage. However, the optimal conservation approach to repairing this damage is not known and as a consequence, research on urushi and related materials is of great interest. For the first time, the effect of changing relative humidity (RH) on the response of urushi is investigated by examining the deflection of a glass substrate coated with a thin film of urushi. Phase shifting interferometry was employed to measure this deflection, from which the in-plane stress developed in the system due to the expansion mismatch in the bilayer was calculated. This was performed for aged (exposed to ultra-violet radiation) and non- aged urushi films. The film stress was observed over 66 hrs under 30...|$|R
5000|$|Opium {{caused a}} stir with its {{controversial}} name and brought accusations that brand designer Yves Saint Laurent was condoning drug use. In the United States, a group of Chinese Americans demanded a change of the name and a public apology from Saint Laurent for [...] "his insensitivity to Chinese history and Chinese American concerns." [...] They formed a committee called the American Coalition Against Opium and Drug Abuse, which expressed outrage at {{the choice of a}} name representing [...] "a menace that destroyed many lives in China." [...] But such controversies rather helped the perfume to be well-publicized, which soon became a best-selling scent. For its launch party in 1977, a tall ship Peking was rented from the South Street Seaport Museum in New York's East Harbor, and writer Truman Capote sat {{at the helm of the}} ship at the party. The ship was draped with banners of gold, red, and purple, and the Oriental theme was displayed with a [...] bronze statue of the Buddha, decorated with white cattleya orchids. YSL carried the Oriental theme into its packaging design as well - the red plastic container holding the perfume's glass vial, designed by Pierre Dinand, was inspired by inro (印籠, いんろう), the small <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquered</b> cases that were worn under kimonos and held perfumes, herbs and medicines.|$|R

5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three <b>Japanese</b> style <b>lacquered</b> wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|R

5000|$|Chinese lacquerware {{had been}} the first to develop shell-inlaid lacquer, at least as early as the Tang dynasty (618-907), and pieces reached Japan as {{diplomatic}} gifts and through trade.

40|$|New Material World: Rethreading Technology {{highlights}} ten contemporary textile {{artists from}} Canada, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, who engage modern technology either by employing or studiously resisting {{it in their}} work. The exhibition explores ways in which some artists utilize technology {{as a tool to}} expand their design capabilities and others use it to further their cultural, political, scientific, or social interests. Technology aids in planning and implementing artwork, allowing artists more time to explore new creative ventures. Modern exchanges of information facilitate collaborations between artists and industry. Although technology has benefited many textile artists, others find new meaning in the materials they choose. The use of non-traditional mediums such as combs, stainless steel, paper, and wood have led to innovative new designs. Some artists use technology as a means to production and design, and others consider their choice and use of material inherently antithetical to technological advancement. This tension between handcrafting and modern machinery has historical precedents, perhaps most famously in the Art and Crafts movement of the midto- late 19 th century. During this period in Great Britain, designer William Morris and art critic John Ruskin opposed industrialization and its perceived ills-the alienation of the worker and shoddy mass-productionand envisioned a utopian society of communal laborers dedicated to handcrafting. According to artist Jessica Smith, with today 2 ̆ 7 s digital capabilities, we are at similar crossroads. Smith 2 ̆ 7 s work invites the viewer to consider the connection between innovation and tradition. She uses chemically enhanced pigments and industrial woven cloth to articulate historical textile patterns. Her installations combine hand-printed wall coverings and Jacquard-woven upholstery with digitally-printed ceramics. For New Material World, Smith has recreated a 19 th-century domestic interior. Here, she draws from 17 th-century fabrics that were woven in England and France, but visually inspired by Asian imports such as Chinese porcelains, Indian textiles, and <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquers.</b> Domestic textiles such as these have communicated both actual and aspiring social status, as well as gender and ethnicity throughout history. Tying the handcrafting versus technology debate with taste and class, Smith is interested in how textiles can transcend historical boundaries...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} his early works in this genre is the [...] (c. 1670, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna). This {{painting}} stands in {{a long tradition of}} Dutch still life paintings depicting vanitas symbols. These symbols include not only hourglasses, skulls and smoking candles but also attributes of scholarship and intellectual inquiry assembled in an amateur collector's cabinet or the study of a humanist scholar. This tradition is also found in the Dutch painter Gerard Dou's rare still lifes, which are considered an important influence on van der Heyden's still lifes. Dou's , which includes still life elements, has been identified as an important influence on this composition. In particular, like in Dou's composition, van der Heyden's still life scene depicts a wide range of objects of an artistic as well as a scientific nature. These objects reference the passion of contemporary scholars for putting together collections of miscellaneous objects. The objects in van der Heyden's Still Life with Globe, Books, Sculpture, and Other Objects were apparently selected to evoke the two intellectual attributes of the active and contemplative life. The contemplative life is the life of art, philosophy and theology while the active life is characterised by curiosity about the outside world and, in particular, the commerce with the New World in which the home country of van der Heyden was actively involved. This world of trade is represented in the globe and atlas, as well as the imported products such as the Chinese silk cloth on the table, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>lacquered</b> box and the exotic animal (a South American iguana) suspended {{at the back of the}} composition. The map on which the atlas is open is a plan of the fortifications of Bergen-op-Zoom. [...] These fortifications had been built during the Eighty Years War with Spain and had played an important role in achieving the first victories against the Spanish troops. They thus referenced the founding myths of the nation. Van der Heyden may also have selected this map as a reference to the recent hostilities with France. The same map is also included in two of his later still lifes. In the lower right of the painting is a large Protestant Bible opened to the end of Het Boeck der Psalmen (Book of Psalms) at the chapter entitled PROVERBIA / Spreuken / SALOMONIS (Solomon's Proverbs). It is likely that the artist intended to reference the messages in Solomon's Proverbs about wisdom, self-discipline and justice as well as the vanitas message, as one of the Proverbs states that only righteousness can deliver from death.|$|R
