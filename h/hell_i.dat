While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, [...] "To <b>hell,</b> <b>I</b> suppose." [...] In 1844, the couple {{bought a house in}} Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often {{with the help of a}} relative or hired servant girl.|$|E

At {{one point during}} the match, after Awesome delivered a suicide dive, Styles said, [...] "And it's a shame he didn't succeed in taking his own life." [...] 20 months after the match, Awesome committed suicide by hanging himself on February 17, 2007. Styles has confirmed that this comment, {{as well as several}} other comments he made, were actually shoots. He said if the Original ECW was ending he was [...] "going to say whatever the <b>hell</b> <b>I</b> wanted."

500|$|From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn {{starred in}} the Broadway musical Coco, {{about the life of}} Coco Chanel. She {{admitted}} that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical. She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, [...] "what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts". The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show. She was nervous about every performance, and recalled [...] "wondering what the <b>hell</b> <b>I</b> was doing there." [...] Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised and Coco was popular with the public—with its run twice extended. She later said Coco marked the first time she accepted that the public was not against her, but actually seemed to love her. Her work earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
500|$|The album's themes {{revolve around}} events {{which took place}} in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's {{handling}} of the United Kingdom general election, {{as well as on the}} state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody <b>hell,</b> <b>I</b> was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E

500|$|The {{composition}} and {{setting of the}} scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide. Otto is heard humming [...] "Iron Man" [...] by Black Sabbath. The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote [...] "Like <b>Hell</b> <b>I</b> Can't". The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography Yes, I Can. Homer mistells the story of [...] "Androcles and the Lion", instead referring to it as [...] "Hercules and the Lion". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Burns's line about getting [...] "A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present" [...] is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt {{to get it out}} of the mailbox, are inspired by the Honeymooners episode [...] "Letter to the Boss".|$|E
500|$|During the October 15, 1973 session, drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens {{contributed to}} the tracks [...] "Peace Go with You", [...] "Rivers of My Fathers", [...] "Back Home", and [...] "The Bottle". Adams, however, was {{disappointed}} that [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] was to be left off the album. The song originally served as an opening monologue concerning the Watergate incident used by Scott-Heron at his concerts, and it contains proto-rap and talking blues elements, in which rhythmic speech or near-speech {{is accompanied by a}} free melody and strict rhythm. The studio version, which was recorded during the album's sessions, was not intended to be for the album prior to Adams' objection, as Scott-Heron said that [...] "nobody outside of Washington seemed to know what the <b>hell</b> <b>I</b> was talking about." [...] Scott-Heron later revisited the experience in the liner notes of the album's 1998 reissue. On Adams' opinion of [...] "H²Ogate Blues", he wrote that [...] "His reply was that even if people didn’t understand the politics it’s still funny as hell."

500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been <b>hell.</b> <b>I</b> know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to <b>hell.</b> <b>I</b> felt I was deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track.

[...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the <b>hell</b> <b>I</b> was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E

With his rank of {{squadron}} leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No.464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, {{he gave a}} series of morale-building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students: [...] "So I, you know, went round and lied like <b>hell.</b> <b>I</b> {{said that it was}} all a [...]" [...] In January 1944, he joined No.2 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Mildura, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No.80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, [...] "a little dark-haired popsy" [...] named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23January 1945.|$|E
