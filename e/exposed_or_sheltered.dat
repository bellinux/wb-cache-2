More specifically, lizards, which forage close to the ground, reduced the abundance of exposed spiders by two-thirds but had no effect on the abundance of sheltered spiders.

40|$|Recruitment and {{population}} structure of Perna perna in low shore mussel beds were investigated over 15 months at six sites {{along the south}} coast of South Africa. Initial, subjective classification of sites as wave <b>exposed</b> <b>or</b> wave <b>sheltered</b> (three of each) was confirmed using the dissolution of cement blocks to measure average water flux and dynamometers for maximum wave force. Recruitment occurred throughout the year, but recruit (1 – 5 mm) densities were significantly higher from January to April 1996 on both shore types. Recruit densities were positively correlated with adult (> 15 mm) densities for both shore types (P 0. 05). Thus wave exposure dramatically affects density, recruitment and mussel size, but not recruitment timing or biomass where there is 100 % cover, and mediates a three-way interaction among food supply, larval supply and intraspecific competition for space. In contrast to shores with saturation recruitment, mussel biomass here appears to be limited by recruit supply and constraints of food, especially on sheltered shores, while density is regulated through intraspecific competition for space primarily on exposed shores and at small spatial scales...|$|R

The mean pit diameter of the antlions exposed to treatments of dry and foot traffic were significantly larger than the mean pit diameter of antlions with the rain treatment. The number of antlions that relocated to shelter after the no treatment and foot traffic treatment was not significantly greater than the number of antlions that relocated to shelter after the treatment of rain. There was a greater proportion that chose shelter as the number of trials increased for no treatment and foot traffic treatment.

Whereas their narrow, natural distribution within species-poor communities in drier, less fertile {{conditions on the}} ridge {{can be explained by}} the selection of adaptive traits and reduced plant competition compared to the more extensive, surrounding richer forest communities on more fertile soils, recent disturbances altering site conditions have diminished their populations. Populations were compared among various terrain and site conditions (ridge spine or rockface, <b>exposed</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheltered)</b> on less disturbed and very disturbed portions of the ridge. A. rupestris was scarce or absent in sites shaded by taller vegetation, probably an inability to establish in conditions associated with deeper soil development. I. praetermissa appeared specially adapted to rockfaces where unstable substrates and poor soil development may restrict competition with other plants. All three species were adversely affected to varying degrees by disturbance and altered site conditions; invasive, fast-spreading, thicket-forming, weeds in disturbed sites on gentler terrain on the ridge spine appear to be especially detrimental to A. rupestris and E. milsumii establishment. Although the larger plant size of I. praetermissa compared to the other two species could mean it is less likely to be shaded out by invading weedy species, residual adults as well as new regeneration may not adapt to changed site conditions following disturbance. Distinguishing between adaptation (of both adults and new regeneration) to changed environmental conditions following disturbance, and ability in competing for space and resources against invading weedy species, is relevant...|$|E
40|$|Rock pools {{represent}} patches or {{islands of}} habitat {{different from the}} surrounding shore. They contain diverse assemblages of invertebrates and algae. The shape, size, height on the shore and exposure to waves are considered important influences on the abundances of organisms. In studies of natural pools, these factors are confounded because pools are rarely comparable; they differ in size, position on the shore and history of colonization. To solve this, experimental pools of different diameters (15, 30 and 50 cm) and depths (5, 15 and 30 cm) were drilled in sandstone rocky shores in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Replicate pools of each size were made in each of 24 randomly-chosen sites, six sites representing each combination of two heights (mid and low) on the shore and sheltered versus wave-exposed habitats. The influence of diameter of the pool is examined here, using data from a total of 360 experimental pools. Despite a 2 - 3 -fold increase in surface-area of pools with increased diameter, {{there was no difference}} in densities of most taxa examined (gastropods, a starfish, sessile invertebrates, algae). An exception was foliose algae, the cover of which was generally greater low on the shore and in 50 cm than 30 cm diameter pools. There were also consistently more species in any stratum (i. e., depth in a pool) in the wider pools. There were approximately 25 - 50 % more species in the widest than the narrowest pools, consistently from season to season and year to year. There were, however, significantly fewer species per unit area of a given stratum in Pools of 50 versus 30 versus 15 cm diameter. These results require further investigation in relation to different theories to explain species-area relationships. Multivariate analyses revealed no influence of diameter on the structure of assemblages of organisms in pools of different diameter. This was true for different strata in pools and at mid- or low-shore positions on <b>exposed</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheltered</b> shores. Diameter of pools thus had remarkably little influence on the organisms; those effects found were consistent. Experimental pools were shown to be effective for testing hypotheses about proposed influences on the ecology of inhabitants.

40|$|Epilithic microphytobenthos (EMPB) is of core {{importance}} in intertidal assemblages and responds {{to a variety}} of environmental variables, including season, light, temperature and exposure to waves. To help understand responses by EMPB to these variables and their interactions, EMPB was compared at 2 different latitudes in eastern Australia. In subtropical Brisbane and temperate Sydney, EMPB was sampled at 4 different heights on shores <b>exposed</b> to, <b>or</b> <b>sheltered</b> from, waves during the austral winters and summers of 2006 to 2008. Trends of increasing biomass with decreasing height on shore supported previous studies. In particular, the interaction between season and height was similar to results of previous studies in Australia. There were no differences in biomass of standing stock between Sydney and Brisbane. Differences in timing of sampling occasions confounded some comparisons, and some observed patterns may be due to differences in rates of recolonisation among treatments. Spectrometric assessment of the composition of pigments in EMPB differed with latitude. Spectral samples were more similar to those from assemblages of cyanobacteria than to assemblages of green algae, and this was more marked in Sydney than in Brisbane. Amounts of chlorophyll a were greater on sheltered shores than on those exposed to waves. These patterns are not easily explained, but serve to illustrate the difficulties of extrapolating patterns and processes from one area to another. Variations in pattern at different heights on the shore and in different years emphasise the need for spatially and temporally extensive data in order to make reliable predictions about EMPB. Improved capacity to make reliable predictions will help us understand how EMPB may respond to our changing climate, which is forecast to be hotter with more frequent storms. © Inter-Research 2010...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{population}} dynamics of the brown mussel, Perna perna, were examined at 18 sites along the south coast of South African. Specifically the effects of wave exposure and tidal height were examined in relation to mussel size, biomass and density. A single set of samples was removed {{from each of the}} 18 sites, over three spring tide cycles. Sites were classified as <b>exposed</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheltered</b> prior to sampling. Principal component analysis (PCA) (based on mussel length data) and length frequency histograms revealed that there was a general decrease in the modal size of the adult mussel cohort with an increase in tidal height. The effects of exposure on mussel size decreased higher on the shore. On the exposed low shore the maximum size of mussels had a mean length of 102. 3 mm and was significantly larger (ANOVA, p l 5 mm) were calculated as real densities from randomly placed quads i. e. not from areas of 100 % cover. Density decreased up the shore; low, mid and high shore zones were significantly different from each other (ANOVA, p< 0. 0001; followed by multiple range tests). There {{was no significant difference between}} the densities of mussels at exposed and sheltered sites within each zone (ANOVA, p= 0. 7155). Recruit (<l 5 mm) densities increased with an increase in adult mussel densities, and this relationship was significant at all zones and for both degrees of exposure (regression analysis, p< 0. 05 in all cases). The regression between recruits and adults was strongest on the mid and high shore exposed sites. There was a general trend towards stronger regressions and greater predictability with an increase in shore height. The presence of free space within the mussel beds and significant regressions between recruit and adult densities indicates that mussel populations are recruit limited. Mean biomass decreased with an increase in shore height and was probably related to the decrease in size and density of mussels at higher shore levels. Exposure did not affect the average biomass within each zone. A fine scale study of the effects of wave exposure, tidal height and substratum type on recruit densities was undertaken at two sites, viz. Diaz Cross and High Rocks. Two shores, one exposed and one sheltered were identified at each of the sites. All shores were classified prior to sampling. Sampling was completed over a 30 day period during peak recruitment, and samples were removed on as many days as sea and tide conditions permitted i. e. daily when possible. The total density of early plantigrades was greater at Diaz Cross than it was at the High Rocks, and this may be related to the local hydrodynamic patterns adjacent to the two sites. Exposure affected the densities of early and late plantigrades on algae on the low shore sites, where greater numbers of recruits were recorded on exposed low shore zones. Densities of plantigrades on the mussel bed and on algae on the mid and high shore were not affected by exposure. Low and mid shore zones usually had greater densities (at 100 % cover of substratum) of plantigrades than the high shore zones, this was probably related to lower settlement rates on the high shore as a result of reduced submergence time. Generally greater plantigrade densities were recorded on algal substrata than on the mussel bed. In only one of the 20 comparisons completed was the density of plantigrades greater on mussels than it was on algae. However when the area of the substratum within a zone was taken into account the number of plantigrades in the mussel bed at a zone was often greater than the number on algae within the same zone. In close to half of these comparisons the total numbers of plantigrades were greater on the mussels than on the algae. This was due to the greater area of mussel bed available to recruits. There was no evidence supporting the suggestion of secondary settlement of plantigrades from algae to the mussel bed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of wave exposure, tidal height and substratum on certain {{aspects of the}} ecology of Perna perna. The importance of these factors is demonstrated at both the adult and early recruit stages of this mussel...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{manuscript}} is {{a result}} of a collaboration between the KU Leuven and the Université d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse. In an era of urbanization, biodiversity is under pressure more than ever. Biodiversity is considered a major driver of ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Green roofs, a prime example of urban novel ecosystems, offer habitats and can hence mitigate some biodiversity loss in cities. Apart from biodiversity, green roofs also offer other ecosystem services, such as thermal regulation, stormwater management, and aesthetic and amenity value. Here we focused on extensive green roofs (substrate depth < 20 cm) as these can be applied widely and are more durable (i. e. less maintenance, self-sustaining). In southern Europe (Mediterranean), the performance of (extensive) green roofs is rather low, probably due to the elevated temperatures and summer drought. One may expect that plant stress on green roofs will further increase as a result of climate change. Irrigation could help plant growth and survival. However, irrigation is often perceived as an unsustainable practice, as water is already a limiting factor in many regions and climate change will lead to an even more severe water scarcity during summer. Therefore, research is needed to select plant species suitable for Mediterranean (unirrigated) extensive green roofs, and to adapt green roof design to meet the requirements of the selected plant species. More northern countries with colder climates (e. g. temperate maritime climate) will also face higher temperatures and erratic precipitation events as a result of climate change. The green roof industries located in these regions will hence also benefit from the outcome of such research. The main goal of this thesis was to elaborate and test a new concept for extensive green roof design, comprising both plant selection and design elements. The work is based on the habitat template theory, which states that natural habitats with similar characteristics as extensive green roofs should be targeted when searching for suitable plant species. Mediterranean regions are a hotspot of biodiversity and contain many habitats that match to some extent the conditions on extensive green roofs (e. g. shallow, free draining, nutrient poor and calcareous soils, high temperature fluctuations, windy). We hence hypothesized that {{it would be possible to}} find potential plant species for use on extensive green roofs. Because of practical reasons we selected the southern part of France as study region. During fieldwork in southern France during the spring of 2011, 372 potential plant species were recorded in 20 natural open Mediterranean habitats. Variation in species composition in relation to environmental factors was analyzed, and the vegetation could be classified into four major vegetation types. When comparing the potential species with a list of species commonly used on green roofs in northwestern Europe, it was found that 79 % is currently not used on green roofs. Results also show that annual species comprise an important part of Mediterranean vegetation; however this life form is currently rarely used on green roofs. As annual species provide many interesting features, especially for regions with prolonged drought, we concluded that this life form should be considered for application on green roofs. Given the large species pool found during the field work, we developed a screening procedure to guide the green roof industry towards the most appropriate species for use on Mediterranean extensive green roofs. Both functional plant traits (specifically related to drought tolerance and self-regulation as these are of prime importance for survival on green roofs) and utilitarian characteristics were used. After statistical analysis, the most important traits were incorporated into a multi-criteria screening tool. This tool also used exclusion criteria (e. g. trees, no stress tolerance) to delete the unsuitable species. It was illustrated on the species found in Mediterranean habitats, which resulted in 34 high potential species not yet used on green roofs. Interestingly, 35 % of these species had an annual life form, confirming our previous recommendation to include annual species in green roof vegetation. As the fieldwork and screening procedure only provided theoretical evidence of the potential of species from Mediterranean habitats for use on extensive green roofs, we tested 18 potential species during a two-year experiment on unirrigated extensive green roofs. Experiments were conducted both in Avignon, France (representative for the Mediterranean climate) and Heverlee, Belgium (representative for the temperate maritime climate). The experimental setup included different substrate compositions (substrate depth 5 or 10 cm; presence/absence of a water retention layer) and exposition (<b>exposed</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheltered).</b> Weather conditions greatly affected vegetation development in both locations. Overall, the deepest substrate depth of 10 cm combined with a water retention layer resulted in the highest cover, species abundance and biodiversity values throughout the experiment. The exposition proved to be a less important factor for species performance. Both bryophytes and weeds established spontaneously over the two years, especially in the sheltered plots. Plant growth and survival on green roofs during drought remains challenging as the substrate is supposed to be light weight, shallow and relatively low in nutrients. In horticulture, the positive effects of organic matter and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) are acknowledged, but evidence of the effects on green roofs is still scarce. We hence examined how AM fungi and organic matter affect early growth and survival of plants in experimental green roofs. The experiment was conducted both in a greenhouse and on a rooftop in Heverlee, Belgium. A seed mix of commonly used green roof plants and an inoculum consisting of Glomus species were used. Organic matter positively affected plant height, dry weight and cover in the greenhouse. No significant effect of AM fungi on initial plant growth and survival was found, although microscopic evidence of AM fungi - root associations was demonstrated. We concluded that a small increase in organic matter can already stimulate plant growth on green roofs. More time is probably needed for the AM fungi - root associations to result in positive effects on plant growth and survival under drought. As stated earlier, irrigation can also help plant growth and survival on green roofs, although this often has a negative connotation in sustainable water management. As information on appropriate green roof irrigation is still very scarce, we reviewed the existing literature and drew attention to alternative water sources and water conservation strategies. Water can be conserved by adapting irrigation requirements (i. e. by targeting the green roof vegetation or materials), by using alternative irrigation sources (e. g. gray water and rainwater harvesting) or by controlling and monitoring irrigation regimes. Some form of irrigation is essential during establishment and the first growing season on all types of green roofs and in all considered climates. Afterwards, irrigation is necessary on green roofs in (semi) -arid climates, and advised in small amounts in the other climates. Minimum irrigation specifications for different climates were proposed, based on the deficit irrigation theory. If green roofs are designed carefully, then irrigation practices can be sustainable in the long term and contribute to better urban life quality. In a final study we focused on the biodiversity and ecosystem services aspect of extensive green roof systems. There is a growing consensus that ecosystem services can be predicted through functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities. We analyzed the initial plant composition of commercial extensive green roof systems in terms of their functional and phylogenetic diversity. Clustering techniques grouped the systems in three green roof types that differ in species richness and composition, substrate depth, installation method and functional and phylogenetic diversity. Correlation between functional diversity and species richness was strongly positive, suggesting that species-rich systems might offer more ecosystem services. We proposed two methods to select the species combination with maximal functional diversity. The described approach is generic in nature and can be used for plant selection for a broad range of novel ecosystems. We conclude that natural habitats in the Mediterranean region can definitely inspire us as a source for development and improvement of extensive green roof design, whether this is for the current Mediterranean climate itself or for other climates under predicted climate change. Appropriate vegetation choice is essential, as well as the design in terms of sustainable irrigation techniques, appropriate substrate depth and composition, and water retention possibilities. Finally suggestions for further research were made.

40|$|To {{unravel the}} {{relation}} between hydrodynamic forcing and {{the dynamics of the}} tidal flat salt-marsh ecosystem, we compared hydrodynamic forcing in terms of proxies relevant to bed sediment motion for four tidal flat salt-marsh ecosystems that were contrasting in terms of wind exposure (sheltered vs. exposed) and lateral development (shrinking vs. expanding). Wave and current field measurements on these four contrasting tidal flat and salt-marsh ecosystems indicated that the hydrodynamic forcing on the bottom sediment (bed shear stress) was strongly influenced by wind-generated waves, more so than by tidal- or wind-drive currents. The measurements further showed that the hydrodynamic forcing decreased considerably landward of the marsh cliff, highlighting a transition from vigorous (tidal flat and pioneer zone) to sluggish (mature marsh) fluid forcing. Spatial wave modeling using measured wind, revealed that the time-integrated wave forcing on the intertidal mudflat in front of the marsh (i. e., the potential bed sediment pickup) was a factor two higher for salt marshes that are laterally shrinking than for laterally expanding marshes, regardless of whether these marshes were <b>exposed</b> to <b>or</b> <b>sheltered</b> from the wind. The same result could not be obtained from a straightforward wind speed and fetch length approach for estimating wave forcing. This confirmed that wave force estimates required spatial modeling to be consistent with the sites trends of shrinking or expanding marshes and wind exposure is not enough to characterize the wave forcing at these sites. Seasonal changes in wave forcing identified from wind measurements potentially provide an alternative mechanism for marsh cliff formation. During the calm summer, fine sediments switches from the water column to the bed. During the following winter, fine sediment is retained within the vegetated regions while being returned to the water column from the bare tidal flats. The continuous slow upward growth of vegetated areas combined with the seasonal cyclic tidal flat elevations, could, during winter, cause a discontinuity at the bare/vegetated boundary. If this discontinuity grows large enough for plant die-off to occur, then a small cliff will form. Crown Copyright © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

We tested two sampling methods, hair collected from hair tubes and faeces (scat) collected along tracks, to assess the effects of key environmental and sampling variables on DNA quality and sampling efficiency. For hair, we tested the influence of hair tube location (distance from forest tracks) on collection rate and sex ratio of animals successfully sampled. For scats, we assessed the effect of time since defecation (1 to 16 days) on genotyping error rates and success under two contrasting environmental conditions (<b>exposed</b> to rainfall <b>or</b> <b>sheltered).</b> We found no bias in the collection rate or sex ratio of animals detected by hair samples with differing proximity to forest tracks. DNA amplification failure for scats exposed to rainfall increased from 28 to 65 % over the 16 -day experimental period. During periods of low rainfall, the length of collection sessions could therefore be extended to increase sample number without risk of DNA degradation. Lack of bias in hair collection rates with proximity to forest tracks provides justification for tube placement close to tracks, as this reduces survey effort.

For hair, we tested the influence of hair tube location (distance from forest tracks) on collection rate and sex ratio of animals successfully sampled. For scats, we assessed the effect of time since defecation (1 to 16 days) on genotyping error rates and success under two contrasting environmental conditions (<b>exposed</b> to rainfall <b>or</b> <b>sheltered).</b> We found no bias in the collection rate or sex ratio of animals detected by hair samples with differing proximity to forest tracks. DNA amplification failure for scats exposed to rainfall increased from 28 to 65 % over the 16 -day experimental period. During periods of low rainfall, the length of collection sessions could therefore be extended to increase sample number without risk of DNA degradation. Lack of bias in hair collection rates with proximity to forest tracks provides justification for tube placement close to tracks, as this reduces survey effort. These findings provide guidance for the development of efficient and cost-effective non-invasive sampling of Scottish pine martens. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
