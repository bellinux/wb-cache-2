40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{frequency}} domain equalization (FDE) sche-mes were originally devised for quasi-static channels. Thus, such equalization schemes could suffer from significant performance degradation in fast-fading channels. This paper proposes a fre-quency domain equalization algorithm {{to mitigate the}} effect of <b>fast</b> time-varying <b>fading.</b> First, a mathematical expression is derived to quantify the total interference resulting from the time variation of the channel. Then, the proposed approach attempts to eliminate the effect of time-variations of the channel. This cancellation allows efficient use of the classical FDE structures in <b>fast</b> time-varying <b>fading</b> environments, although they are built upon the quasi-static channel model. Simulation results of bit-error-rate performance are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed al-gorithm.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the following issue: if <b>fast</b> <b>fades</b> are Markovian and {{known at the}} receiver, while the transmitter has only a coarse quantization of the fading process, what capacity penalty comes from having the transmitter act on the current coarse quantization alone? For time-varying channels which experience rapid time variations, sender and receiver typically have asymmetric channel side information. To avoid the expense of providing, through feedback, detailed channel side information to the sender, the receiver offers the sender only a coarse, generally time-averaged, representation {{of the state of}} the channel, which we term slow variations. Thus, the receiver tracks the fast variations of the channel (and the slow ones perforce) while the sender receives feedback only about the slow variations. While the fast variations (micro-states) remain Markovian, the slow variations (macro-states) are not. We compute an approximate channel capacity in the following sense: each rate smaller than the “approximate ” capacity, computed using results by Caire and Shamai, can be achieved for sufficiently large separation between the time scales for the slow and <b>fast</b> <b>fades.</b> The difference between the true capacity and the approximate capacity is (log 2 () log (log ())), where is the ratio between the speed of variation of the channel in the macro- and micro-states. The approximate capacity is computed by power allocation between the slowly varying states using appropriate water filling. Index Terms—Capacity, channel side information, Markovian models...|$|R
