50|$|<b>Gradiant</b> is {{currently}} working on several technologies for the implementation of advanced applications, such as cloud technologies and other next generation paradigms, especially in connection with privacy and security, development platforms and analytical systems. In this field, <b>Gradiant</b> cooperates with the key Spanish multi-national companies and has operative demonstrators. Research is also focusing on enhanced reality powered context-dependent information systems for training and technical management in industrial and hospital environments. Regarding the provision of services to network suppliers, <b>Gradiant</b> is working in the integration of heterogeneous services according to international standards. Finally, there is also much work being done in the field ofbusiness intelligence technologies (dashboards, patented algorithms for the in-memory compression of multidimensional databases, big data mining), equally in cooperation with important private firms. Gradiant’s substantial networkingcapacities facilitate the implementation of a multi-layered approach to global projects, guaranteeing optimal results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gradiant</b> {{was created}} after the {{initiative}} {{of a group of}} lecturers at the School of Telecommunications Engineering (Escola de Enxeñaría de Telecomunicación), University of Vigo (Fernando Pérez-González, Javier González Castaño and Carlos Mosquera) who believed that their research experience and its transference to the economic sector could and should be optimised. With this idea, in 2003 they started to discuss the possibility of creating a technological center. A viability study was carried out and presented to private companies working in the sector in Galicia and to the administration. The foundation was officially constituted in December 2007, with Fernando Pérez-González as executive director; <b>Gradiant</b> started operations in May 2008, in temporary facilities provided by the university. The philosophy was to combine the university's creativity and potential in the generation of ideas with the private sector's doctrines on efficiency.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of radio}} {{spectrum}} and, most particularly, the coexistence of different {{services and the}} reuse of radio frequencies is oneof Gradiant’s areas of interest. In this regard, the paradigm of cognitive radio generates conflicts of interest in bands such as UHF, traditionally assigned to television broadcasting. Among these we may highlight the monitoring of spectrum use, both for mobile and fixed services, {{and the development of}} databases for the real-time upgrading of spectrum status and availability. Equally, <b>Gradiant</b> is working on the development of new systems capable of making more efficient use of the spectrum, and also on the physical and access layers, specifically on the development of new devices with which the coverage of maritime and terrestrial communication systems can be extended. On the other hand, satellite communications continue to gain importance within <b>Gradiant,</b> with the developmentof projects in the field of S-bands and the participation in European proposals to extend the capabilities of current satellite communication systems.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{diffusion}} cloud method by dyes and the velocity correlation method {{are used to}} calculate {{the diffusion}} coefficients in Omura and Sasebo Bay. In case of the dyes, Uranine is very cheap for dyes, clear green color, and keeps clear clouds for about two hours in a sea. Accordingly we can trace easily edges of the clouds by boats. When we calculated the increment ratio of the cloud area, we used two different ways. They are instant <b>gradiant</b> (⊿A/⊿T) and mean <b>gradiant</b> (A/T). In mean <b>gradiant</b> way, the <b>gradiant</b> of diffusion coefficient was smaller than that of the rule of 4 / 3 (by Richardson), and the diffusion coefficients were 1. 4 × 105 cm 2 /sec in Omura Bay and 1. 6 × 105 cm 2 /sec in Sasebo Bay at 900 m-scale. When we apply the instant <b>gradiant</b> way, we must be carefull to measure the area of the dyes clouds. The <b>gradiant</b> of the diffusion coefficient by the velocity correlation method was smallest among the those we applied, but the value was greater than the other during about 2 - 3 hours.

This hydraulic head combined with a flow depth of from 60 to 120 meters (200 - 400 ft) provided the energy to achieve flood flow velocities as high as 30 m/s (65 mph), which eroded the topsoil and underlying basalt, gouging the complex network of channels, basins, potholes and buttes that are found there even today.

40|$|When heavy ions collide at ultra-relativistic energy, {{thousands}} of particles are emitted {{and it is}} reasonable to attempt to use hydrodynamic descriptions, with suitable initial conditions, to describe the time evolution of the collisons. In the longitudinal direction pions seem to exhibit Landau flow. This simple model assumes that all the entropy in the collisions is created the instant the two Lorentz contracted nuclei overlap and that the system then expands adiabatically. The system also displays radial and elliptic flow. Radial flow is manifested as a broadening of the pT distributions with respect to pp collisions. It is typically thought to result from multiple scattering of partons or hadrons before dynamic freeze-out. Elliptic flow occurs when heavy ions do not collide exactly head on. The initial geometrical asymetry is translated into a momentum asymetry via pressure <b>gradiants.</b> Since these gradients are self quenching, strong elliptic flow is thought to be linked to early thermalization and a large initial pressure. Using the concept of limiting fragmentation we attempt to sketch a link between the initial and final states of relativistic heavy ion collisions using new preliminary data from the BRAHMS collaboration on elliptic and radial flow.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{intent of}} this work is to extend Implicit Monte Carlo Diffusion (IMD) [Gen. 2001] to account for {{frequency}} dependence and to incorporate the difference formulation[Szo. 2005] as a source manipulation variance reduction technique. This work shows the derivation of the probabilities and the associated proofs which govern the frequency dependent IMD algorithm. The frequency dependent IMD code was tested using both grey and frequency dependent benchmarks. The Su and Olson semi-analytic Marshak wave benchmark was used for grey problems[Su 1996]. The Su and Olson semi-analytic picket fence benchmark {{was used for the}} frequency dependent problems[Su 1999]. The dependence upon mesh reﬁnement was tested for both the grey and frequency dependent algorithms. This work also includes the derivation of the difference formulation as it applies to IMD. The newly derived difference formulation is then tested using aforemen- tioned benchmark problems. The effectiveness of the difference formulation is analyzed for both the grey and the frequency dependent implementations. We show that the frequency dependent IMD algorithm reproduces the Su and Olson benchmarks. The spatial reﬁnement studies dependence indicate that while solution accuracy is not signiﬁcantly compromised with coarse meshes, spatial resolution can suffer dramatically. The temporal reﬁnement studies indicate that the existence of numerical diffusion for large time steps may require adaptive mesh reﬁnement in time. Frequency group mesh reﬁnement studies indicates that the computational cost of reﬁning the frequency group structure is likely less than that of deterministic methods. This work demonstrates that applying the difference formulation to the IMD algorithm can result in an overall increase in the ﬁgure of merit for frequency dependent problems. However, the creation of negatively weighted particles from the difference formulation can cause signiﬁcant instabilities in regions of the problem with sharp spatial <b>gradiants</b> in the solution. This will require the development of an adaptive implementation of the difference formulation to focus its use in regions that are at or near thermal equilibrium...|$|R

Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed in the calculations. The chemical effect of CO 2 was numerically separated from its effects of thermal and transport properties using the strategy developed previously by the authors. Numerical results indicate that the chemical effect of CO 2 significantly reduces the burning velocity of CH 4 /O 2 /N 2 /CO 2 flames. While the chemical effect of CO 2 slightly lowers the mixture adiabatic flame temperature, the significant reduction of the burning velocity by the chemical effect of CO 2 is primarily a direct consequence of the reduced temperature <b>gradiant</b> across the reaction zone.

40|$|Abstract. Development of {{a stable}} nite element model for solving steady {{incompressible}} vis-cous °uid °ows in three dimensions is the main theme of the present study. For stability reasons, weighting functions are designed in favor of eld variables on the upstream side. For accuracy rea-sons, it is required that weighting functions be equipped with the streamline operator so that false diusion errors can be largely suppressed. In the steady-state analysis of Navier{Stokes equations, we adopt the mixed formulation to preserve mass conservation on quadratic elements which accom-modate the Ladyzhenskaya{Babuska{Brezzi (LBB) stability condition. To resolve diculties arising from asymmetry and indeniteness in the resulting large-size matrix equations, we abandon the elimination-like solution solver because the storage demand exceeds the ability of our hardware to solve for three-dimensional problems. A modern iteration solver, known as the biconjugate <b>gradiant</b> stabilized (BICGSTAB) solution solver, is thus implemented in an element-by-element fashion to eectively alleviate the problem. For performance reasons, the nite element code developed here should be implemented in a hardware environment which is suited {{to the use of}} an iterative solver. To this end, our analysis is implemented in shared memory parallel architectures, CRAY C- 90 and J- 90.

The most familiar form of this gives a force on a charged particle that is proportional to the slowly varying gradient of the intensity of a high frequency electromagnetic field and directed down the intensity <b>gradiant.</b> For a field amplitude simply oscillating in time there is a simple derivation of this formula, but in the more general case of a travelling wave the problem is more difficult. Over the years there has been much work on this using Hamiltonian or Lagrangian averaging techniques, but little or no investigation of how well these theories work. Here we look at the very basic problem of a particle entering a region with a monotonically increasing electrostatic field amplitude and being reflected. We show that the equation of motion derived from a widely quoted ponderomotive potential only agrees with the numerically computed orbit within a restricted parameter range and that outside this range it shows features which are inconsistent with any ponderomotive potential quadratic in the field amplitude. Since the ponderomotive force plays a fundamental role in a variety of problems in plasma physics we think that it is important to point out that even in the simplest of configurations standard theories may not be accurate...|$|E

STRESS, STRAIN AND ELASTIC CONSTANTS Stress {{and strain}} have many definitions. Although {{how they are}} defined doesn't actually change the physics, {{there are differences in}} effectiveness. Strain should be a relative quantity. Before defining strains, we must first declare the reference state. That's reasonable because strain depicts deformation. Strain should also be rotationally invariant, as how much an object is deformed doesn't depend on the angle we look at it. From now on we'll specify the configuration of an object using configurational variable X; Y or Z, which tells the shape of the material, i. e., its surface constraints. The deformation of an object from one configuration to the other is specified by the deformation <b>gradiant</b> J, usually Y = JX. The deformation is assumed to be macroscopically homogeneous, i. e., the surface constraints of that object change uniformly according to J. However, it doesn't have to be a microscopically homogeneous process as different types of atoms on each sublattices may have different atomic-scale relaxations. Let X be deformed into Y : Y = JX. The Lagrangian strain is defined to be j Y X = 1 2 (J T J Γ 1) (1. 1) Here superscript T means transpose. The X in j Y X is to denote the reference state and Y to denote the final state.

In this paper, we discuss the processing and interpretation of a multichannel seismic reflection profile across the continental margin that was collected {{as part of this}} effort. This profile reveals several features of the forearc that were not apparent in an earlier, coincident relection profile. One of {{the most important of these}} features is a very strong bottom simulating reflection (BSR) beneath the midslope region that is nearly continuous from water depths of about 1500 m to 600 m, where it appears to crop out on the seafloor. The pressure and temperature conditions at the BSR derived from our observations are remarkably consistent with the experimentally determined phase diagram for a methane hydrate/seawater system over a broad range of temperatures and pressures, assuming hydrostatic pressure and temperature <b>gradiant</b> measured near the base of the continental slope during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) leg 146. Interval velocities and reflection coefficients derived from the data indicate that the BSR represents a contrast between sediment with a small amount of hydrate overlying sediment containing free gas, consistent with results obtained during leg 146. Although the regional distribution of the anomalously strong BSR beneath the midslope is poorly known, we speculate that it may be related to apparent slop instability. The data also provide constraints on the thickness and geometry of the Siletz terrane, which is the basement beneath the shelf and acts as the subduction zone backstop. A deep reflection, which might mistakenly be interpreted to be Moho if coincident large-aperture data were not available, is interpreted to be the base of the Siletz terrane. A "recently" active strike-slip (?) fault zone that overlies the seaward edge of the Siletz terrane suggests that the Siletz terrane controls the location of decoupling of the subduction complex from the rest of the forearc...|$|E
40|$|We had {{observed}} {{a couple of}} new phenomena in which, two liquid bulks in {{contact with each other}} do not coalesce. The main reason seems to be the motion of the surface in the place of contact, which forms an air film between the bulk boundaries. The surface velocities is also estimated and showed to be near each other and also near the surface velosities in the similar phenomena reported before. 1 Introdution When two drops of one liquid come in contact, they simply coalesce and form a single drop. This is to minimize the free surface of the liquid, and accordingly minimize the surface potential energy caused by surface tension[1]. But can we set the circumstances such that the two tangent drops do not coalesce, even though externally pushing them toward each other? The answer is yes, and this is the main point of discussion in this article. We have recently found a class of effects in which two liquid bulks of the same material touch each other, but do not coalesce. In all cases there is even an additional force pushing the bulks toward each other. These phenomena can be divided into two categories. The first category is the floating of a liquid drop on the free surface of the same liquid. This free surface is, sometimes, the flat surface of the liquid in a container and sometimes the surface of another drop. This phenomenon had been seen before in two different cases; we have observed a third case. In the first case a traveling water droplet floats {{on the surface of the}} water, till it is moving faster than some critical velocity [2, 6]. The second case is completely different in appearance: Two liquid drops of the same kind but with different temperatures are pushed to each other but do not coalesce [3], because the tempreture <b>gradiant</b> causes a surface tension gradient, which lead...|$|E
40|$|An {{elementary}} (major {{and trace}} elements) and isotopic (87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and δ 18 O) geochemical {{study has been}} achieved {{in order to determine}} and to quantify the petrogenetic mechanisms that gave rise to silicic magmas in Iceland. The target of this approach consists not only of understanding the genesis of these magmas but also in addressing their significance in terms of Iceland geodynamic evolution. The main results of this thesis are as follows: In course of Iceland history, most of the silicic rocks appear to have been generated by partial melting of the hydrated metabasaltic crust in a rift zone environment. In this place, the interaction between hot spot and mid-oceanic ridge is important resulting in a geothermal gradient high enough to exceed the solidus temperature of the partially hydrated basaltic crust. However, at the periphery of the island (i. e. Snæfellsnes Peninsula and Öræfajökull volcanic system), far from both the mantle plume centre and the rift-zone, the geothermal gradient is lower, precluding to step over the solidus temperature of hydrated metabasalts. This situation favoured the genesis of silicic magmas by fractional crystallisation (with possibly slight crustal assimilation). The link that exists between the composition of silicic rocks and the geodynamic environment of their genesis has been used together with age determination in order to establish the time-space geodynamic evolution of Iceland. The proposed model is {{based on the fact that}} mid-Atlantic ridge migrate relatively to the plume centre and on the "accretion - over lapping" mechanism that best accounts for the abnormally great width of Iceland. Iceland demonstrates that oceanic plateaus can give rise to significant volumes (towards 10 %) of silicic magmas; in other words, it can be a potential environment for continental crust genesis in a purely oceanic environment. A comparison between these "continental" rock compositions from recent oceanic plateaus and primitive continental crust one (TTG) shows that, in spite of the Icelandic high geothermal gradients, which are assumed to be similar to the early Earth ones, modern oceanic plateaus cannot generate magmas having the primitive continental crust composition. Thus, it is concluded that oceanic plateau environment has not played a significant role, in the primitive continental crust genesis. Consequently, the "Iceland model" is not a modern analogue of the environment where proto-continental crust formed. L'approche principalement géochimique menée (éléments majeurs et en trace, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, etdelta 18 O) a montré que : tout au long de l'histoire de l'Islande, le <b>gradiant</b> géothermique résultant de l'interaction ride-panache mantellique favorise la genèse des magmas acide par fusion partielle de la croûte métabasaltique au centre de l'île et par cristallisation fractionnée en périphérie. En se basant sur le point précédent et des échantillons datés, un modèle d'évolution géodynamique de l'Islande a pu être établit afin de rendre compte de la largeur anormalement élevée de l'île. La comparaison des roches acides (roches "continentales") émises en Islande, à Hawaï et à Kerguelen, avec celles de la croûte continentale primitive (TTG) a montré que les plateaux océaniques n'ont pas été un environnement favorable lors de la genèse de la croûte primitive...|$|E
