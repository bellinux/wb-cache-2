Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. Our analysis considers short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible <b>fats</b> and <b>oils.</b> In that monthly quantities of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> are likely to be relatively fixed, an inverse almost ideal demand system specification is used. A smooth transition function is used to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> in the United States. The results suggest that short-run demand conditions for <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> experienced a gradual structural shift that began in the late 1980 s or early 1990 s and persisted into the mid- 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in scale flexibilities across regimes were modest in most cases. The results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> in response to consumption increases are rather small.

Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. We consider short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible <b>fats</b> and <b>oils.</b> In that monthly quantities of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> are likely to be relatively fixed, we utilize an inverse AIDS specification. Our analysis consists of two components. In the first, we utilize a smooth transition function to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> in the U. S. Our results suggest that short-run demand conditions for <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> experienced a rather rapid structural shift in the early 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in flexibilities across regimes are modest in most cases. Our results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for <b>fats</b> and <b>oils.</b> An important distinction occurs for lard and tallow, which exhibit a very elastic scale response. This suggests that scale increases in the consumption of edible <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> will significantly decrease consumers' marginal valuation of these animal fats. A second segment of our analysis considers dynamic extensions to the IAIDS model that recognize habit effects. Although nested hypothesis testing supports the dynamic specification over the static IAIDS model, price and scale flexibilities are quite similar to the static case.

40|$|The {{differences}} in intake amount of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> {{and in the}} intake ratios of the constituent fatty acids {{are closely related to}} prevention and contraction of the life style related diseases. In the present paper we investigated and analyzed the usage status of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> for cooking in mass feeding facilities and in the home. This study shows that <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> were used properly in 86 % of cooking in mass feeding facilities and in 72 % in private homes. Twelve types of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> were used in mass feeding facilities compared with 15 in private homes. Survey results indicate that soybean oil was used most frequently in 88 %of the mass feeding facilities, sesame oil in 76 %, butter in 64 %, margarine in 52 %and rapeseed oil in 32 %. Both olive oil and sesame oil were used most frequently in 48 % of home cooking sites, margarine and butter in 41 %and 40 %, respectively, and both rapeseed oil and corn oil in 38 %. Reasons for selecting cooking <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> in the mass feeding facilities were "good for health" and "adhere to the brand of manufacturer", whereas the home cooking sites specified "good for health" and "in use from a long time ago" as the major reasons. In the selection of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils.</b> their reasonable prices were common considerations. Both the mass feeding facilities and home cooking sites were careful about reasonable prices of <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> for their selection, and also careful about preventing oxidation and deterioration of the oils.

50|$|Animal <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> are lipid {{materials}} {{derived from}} animals. Physically, oils are liquid at room temperature, and fats are solid. Chemically, both <b>fats</b> and <b>oils</b> {{are composed of}} triglycerides. Although many animal parts and secretions may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from rendered tissue fats obtained from livestock animals like pigs, chickens and cows. Dairy products also yield popular animal <b>fat</b> and <b>oil</b> products such as cheese, butter, and milk.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{between the}} oils and the enzyme causes the fatty acids of the triglycerides to exchange positions to the -1 and -3 glycerides, thereby altering the chemical composition and physical {{properties of the}} fat. Using a 1,3-specific enzyme, only the fatty acids in the 1,3 positions are shifted around, and the 2-position is untouched. Unsaturated fatty acids in the 2-position are more often found naturally in plant lipids or vegetable oil sources. Allowing the rearrangement of the saturated fatty acids {{to occur in the}} 1-position and 3-position increases the amount of bioavailable unsaturated fatty acids. Enzymes most suitable for this process are esterase; acylase; those enzymes that facilitate acidolysis reactions, transesterification reactions, ester synthesis or ester interchange reactions; enzymes having phospholipase or protease activity, including thermostable and thermotolerant hydrolase activity; and polynucleotides. From the two original fats, six different structures are produced during enzymatic Interesterification. A fixed bed system is the most common commercial process used for enzymatic interesterification. In a fixed bed process, the blended liquid oil and solid (hard <b>fat)</b> <b>oil</b> flow through a system consisting of an oil purification bed and an enzyme bed. The oil purification bed removes impurities from the oil blend so that the enzyme activity can be maintained at its highest performance. The enzyme bed allows for the enzymatic interesterification of the oil blend as the blend passes through the bed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Fat,</b> <b>oil</b> {{and grease}} {{are the three}} {{elements}} usually found in the municipal sewage systems as the results of improper disposal from the sink. These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a plumbing device known as grease trap has caused the trapped of <b>fat,</b> <b>oil</b> and grease in the sewage systems. There {{are two types of}} grease trap, namely Passive Grease Trap and Active Grease Trap. These grease types are collected and they can be recycled and used to produce an energy source, for example biodiesel. In Malaysia, the usages of passive grease traps are exercised. There are two parameters that govern the construction of the grease trap, namely retention time and flow rate. The ratio of sizing including the empirical formulations regarding the flow rate and the retention time will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. Furthermore, the {{understanding of the nature of}} the <b>fat,</b> <b>oil</b> and grease and the construction guideline for grease trap will be covered in this paper...|$|E
