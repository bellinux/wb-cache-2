5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs {{to have a few}} hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E

In the first round Watson comfortably {{defeated}} Tímea Babos, setting up a second round meeting with Latvia Anastasija Sevastova. Watson surprisingly lost but picked <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> help Great Britain reach a World Group II play-off tie in the Fed Cup which included impressive victories over Tímea Babos of Hungary and Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria in the all-important Euro/Africa Group I play-off.|$|E

Her first application {{to study at}} the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar in Vienna was accepted, and {{she moved to the}} Austrian capital in 1995 to begin her four-year study as a student of Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer, well known for his parts in Mephisto, Out of Africa and Never Say Never Again, started teaching at the seminar at the same time.|$|E

A road debut over 10km followed later that month and she pipped Dire Tune at the line to take the World's Best 10K in Puerto Rico. She performed well on the 2013 IAAF Diamond League that year, finishing second at the Shanghai Diamond League, FBK Games, Bislett Games and Meeting Areva. In the 5000m final at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics she finished just outside the medals with a fourth-place finish.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, after {{pleading}} {{not guilty}} at Winchester Crown Court, Nicholson was jailed for 11 years for conspiracy to blackmail during the SHAC campaign. Police obtained evidence {{to secure the}} conviction by bugging a 2007 meeting in a cottage in Moorcote, near Hook, Hampshire, attended by Nicholson and six other SHAC activists, as well as hired cars they had used. The bugging was part of Operation Achilles, a police operation against animal rights activists that led to 32 arrests in May 2007, carried out by 700 officers in England, Amsterdam and Belgium. Nicholson gave <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> police when she heard about the raids; she was arrested and denied bail.|$|E
25|$|The group {{formally}} meets Diana {{who they}} learn has a frail body and has lost her will to live. Diana {{has the power}} to glimpse into the future and see people's fates but Shinjiro eventually convinces her that even if the circumstances look dire, she can fight her destiny and give her a new path to follow. Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone. Soon, after learning about the Five Star Warriors, Shinjiro recruits Gemini to the Star Division due to her ties to the Five Star Warriors. But in discovering that Ranmaru is one of their enemies, Gemini's sister Geminine—who resides in her body as an alter-ego—plots to exact revenge for her master's death. Shinjiro persuades Geminine not to go through with it. Afterwards, subduing an attack led by Ranmaru, Geminine decides to rest inside Gemini for a while after using too much of her influence to dominate Gemini's body.|$|E

25|$|This festival had {{a legendary}} {{aetiology}} {{in a particularly}} delicate episode of Roman history and also recurs at (or shortly after) a particular time of the year, that of the so-called caprificatio when branches of wild fig trees were fastened to cultivated ones to promote insemination. The historical episode narrated by ancient sources concerns the siege of Rome by the Latin peoples that ensued the Gallic sack. The dictator of the Latins Livius Postumius from Fidenae would have requested the Roman senate that the matronae and daughters {{of the most prominent}} families be surrendered to the Latins as hostages. While the senate was debating the issue a slave girl, whose Greek name was Philotis and Latin Tutela or Tutula proposed that she together with other slave girls would render <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the enemy camp pretending to be the wives and daughters of the Roman families. Upon agreement of the senate, the women dressed up elegantly and wearing golden jewellery reached the Latin camp. There they seduced the Latins into fooling and drinking: after they had fallen asleep they stole their swords. Then Tutela gave the convened signal to the Romans brandishing an ignited branch after climbing on the wild fig (caprificus) and hiding the fire with her mantle. The Romans then irrupted into the Latin camp killing the enemies in their sleep. The women were rewarded with freedom and a dowry at public expenses.|$|E
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
500|$|The {{impossibility of}} marital rape under English common law was {{suggested}} in Sir Matthew Hale’s Historia Placitorum Coronæ (History of the Pleas of the Crown), published posthumously in 1736, 60 {{years after his}} death. In it he stated that: [...] "the husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her husband, consent which she cannot retract". In other words, by consenting to marriage, a wife had given her body {{to her husband and}} also gave irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband. The first edition of Archbold's Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases in 1822 reiterated the position that: [...] "A husband also cannot be guilty of a rape upon his wife".|$|E

500|$|In {{her first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Lauren {{is a member}} of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that [...] "Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce." [...] Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: [...] "Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who do things like that in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E

[...] She moved there in August 1863. [...] While living there she was confirmed and began to make confession regularly. [...] Around Easter 1865, she confessed {{the murder of her}} half-brother to Arthur Wagner, described the circumstances and said she would give <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the police.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Elisabeth became even more restless and obsessive, {{weighing}} <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three times a day. She regularly took steam baths to prevent weight gain; by 1894 she had wasted away to near emaciation, reaching her lowest point of 95.7lbs (43.5kg). There were some aberrations in Elisabeth's diet that appear to be signs of binge eating, On one occasion in 1878 the Empress astonished her travelling companions when she unexpectedly visited a restaurant incognito, where she drank champagne, ate a broiled chicken and an Italian salad, and finished with a [...] "considerable quantity of cake". She may have satisfied her urge to binge in secret on other occasions; in 1881 she purchased an English country house and had a spiral staircase built from her living room into the kitchen, so that she could reach it in private.|$|E
2500|$|When Gleason {{moved to}} CBS, Kelton was left behind; her {{name had been}} {{published}} in Red Channels, a book that listed and described reputed communists (and communist sympathizers) in television and radio, and the network {{did not want to}} hire her. Gleason reluctantly let her leave the cast, with a cover story for the media that she had [...] "heart trouble". At first he turned down Meadows as Kelton's replacement. Meadows wrote in her memoir that she slipped back to audition again and frumped <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> convince Gleason that she could handle the role of a frustrated (but loving) working-class wife. Rounding out the cast, Joyce Randolph played Trixie, Ed Norton's wife. Elaine Stritch had played the role as a tall and attractive blonde in the first sketch, but was quickly replaced by Randolph. Comedy writer Leonard Stern always felt The Honeymooners was more than sketch material and persuaded Gleason to make it into a full hour-long episode.|$|E

2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E

Behind her teachers' backs she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called , which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the illusive , which is said to tell the world's lost history. However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.

To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws, until eventually joining forces with Sir Crocodile, leading Baroque Works with him, using the codename [...] and becoming their vice-president. After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates and grows so fond of them that she gives <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Government in order to save them. Only after they discover her motives, and declare open war on her powerful nemesis to get her back, does she come to realize that she has finally found people who will never sell her out, and becomes a part of the crew. After the two-year period where the Straw Hats are separated, Robin further hones her Devil Fruit powers to the point she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself.|$|E
