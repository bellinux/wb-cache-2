Even the tradition-ally more affordable in-state, public four-year college costs were $ 8, 655 for the 2012 - 13 school year, an increase of 4. 8 percent from the prior school year. While these figures may reflect Postsecondary education costs in the United States today are rising with an increasing shift from societal responsibility to individual burden, thereby driving greater student borrowing. Evidence suggests that (i) such student debt may have undesirable educational effects and potentially jeopardize household balance sheets and (ii) student loans may better support educational attainment and eco-nomic mobility if accompanied by other, non-repayable financial awards. However, given declines in need-based aid and falling state support for postsecondary costs, policymakers and parents alike have failed to produce a compelling complement to debt-dependent financial aid that is capable of improv-ing outcomes and forestalling assumption of ever-increasing student debt for a majority of U.

40|$|The Assumption of debt {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient institutes of civil law, which realizes a passive-subjective {{modification}} of the obligatory agreement. There are only few procedural guidelines on this institute, for this reason jurists have long questioned themselves about the structure, the cause and the subject of the Assumption of debt. This piece of writing aims to identify an innovative theory relative to the nature of the assumption of debt, to be intended not as the contract itself in favour of a third party but as a contract with an essential three-sided structure. Moreover, there’s the attempt to demonstrate the subsistence of a dual causal profile, given the presence in the assumption of debt of both the generic cause and the specific cause; this peculiarity, identified with respect for the reconstruction on the cause of the transaction, makes the institute of assumption of debt very adaptable and adequate to satisfy the most heterogeneous needs of the partners. In conclusion, the subject of the assumption has been analyzed, dedicating more attention to the assumption of future debts. After demonstrating the validity of assumption on future debts a comparison has been made between the assumption of future debts, the bail bond omnibus and the letter of comfort, identifying similarities and differences between the three.

When a firm leases an asset, the accounting treatment of the expense depends upon whether it is categorized as an operating or a capital lease. Operating lease expenses are treated as part of the operating expenses, but we will argue that they really represent financing expenses. Consequently, the operating income, capital, profitability and cash flow measures for firms with operating leases have to be adjusted when operating lease expenses get categorized as financing expenses. This can have significant effects not just on valuation model inputs, but also on some multiples such as Value/EBITDA ratios that are widely used in valuation. ...|$|R
