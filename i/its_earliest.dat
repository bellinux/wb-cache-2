A vestibule consisting of six columns preceded the cella which had its side walls decorated with pilasters in Corinthian order.|$|E
5|$|The archeological {{record for}} the {{prehistory}} of Biblical Hebrew is far more complete than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself. Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested from 2350BCE to 1200BCE, {{the end of the}} Bronze Age. The Northwest Semitic languages, including Hebrew, differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age (1200–540BCE), although in <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

5|$|Buddhism {{first entered}} China during the Eastern Han and was first {{mentioned}} in 65 AD. Liu Ying (d.71 AD), a half-brother to Emperor Ming of Han (r.57–75 AD), {{was one of}} <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> Chinese adherents, although Chinese Buddhism at this point was heavily associated with Huang-Lao Daoism. China's first known Buddhist temple, the White Horse Temple, was constructed outside {{the wall of the}} capital, Luoyang, during Emperor Ming's reign. Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{negotiations}} leading to {{the transfer of the}} codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag (Berlin, c. 1961); for an account that includes a hitherto unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg 'to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> request'.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E

5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and <b>its</b> <b>earliest</b> part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
5|$|Most French rulers {{since the}} Middle Ages {{made a point}} of leaving their mark on a city that, {{contrary}} to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war.

At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes.|$|E
