Guilbault [Topology 34 (1) (1995) 99 – 108] has shown that certain nontrivial contractible manifolds possess disjoint spines. His results stem from a standing conjecture regarding disjoint spines in contractible 4 -manifolds constructed by Mazur. More to the point, there is a <b>dimensional</b> <b>requirement</b> introduced by his techniques; Guilbault produces such manifolds in dimensions n⩾ 9. We shall provide techniques which allow the construction of examples in dimensions n⩾ 5 following the path laid out by Guilbault.

The automotive industry, especially, has paid huge attention to additive manufacturing, and actively applies it to their design, research, development and manufacturing processes. Selective laser sintering (SLS) in additive manufacturing is emerging and popular, and is often used to produce jigs and fixtures for cost benefits and efficiency in the manufacturing industry.

40|$|Target {{tracking}} {{using multiple}} sensors is one important application in military surveillance and industrial sensing. Due to the communication constraints between each sensor {{and the data}} processor that estimates the target state using all the data from multiple sensors, it is crucial for each sensor to compress its measurements optimally so that the data processor can estimate the target state with minimum mean square error. We limit the data compression at each sensor to be a linear transform that reduces the measurement dimension. We use the results in [10] to do measurement compression and obtain the optimal linear transform matrix for each sensor based on steady state analysis. To activate or remove a sensor dynamically, we consider a sequential update scheme to modify the data compression matrix for each sensor with an arbitrary <b>dimensional</b> <b>requirement</b> due to the communication constraint. We compare our approach with traditional centralized and distributed tracking schemes and indicate the advantages of using sensor data compression for tracking in a sensor network environment.

The method, known as Spatially Constrained Micro-Electro-Deposition or SCMED, {{is being developed}} {{as part of an}} effort to provide sub-millimeter sized tools and extra degrees of freedom to existing tele-operated micro-surgical robots and micro-manipulators. These applications require fabrication processes capable of producing three dimensional structures, with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, using a range of materials and at reasonable rates. Current micro-fabrication technology is,unable to meet these requirements. The three <b>dimensional</b> <b>requirement</b> is particularly relevant given the present dependence on essentially two dimensional micro-fabrication methods derived from micro-electronics. In SCMED, electrodeposition is localized by placing a sharp tipped electrode in a plating substrate, and applying a voltage. Structures are built by moving the electrode appropriately with respect to the substrate. Electrochemical theory, including mass transport to regions of localized field, is discussed, and a model of deposition profile presented. SCMED is shown to be capable of producing three dimensional polycrystalline nickel structures on the micrometer scale, including a multi-coiled helical spring. Vertical deposition rates of 6 $ mu m$/s are observed, two orders of magnitude greater than those of conventional electrodeposition. The process can potentially deposit and etch a wide rage of materials including pure metal, alloys and polymers with sub-micrometer resolution, thereby overcoming important limitations or current technology...|$|E

50|$|In general, {{scale models}} can be {{classified}} into three classes depending {{on the degree of}} similitude satisfaction they exhibit. To begin, a true model is one with complete similitude—that is, all π terms are equal for the scale model and the prototype. True models are difficult to realize in reality due to the many possible quantities the modeler must consider. As a result, modelers identify the important dimensionless quantities and construct a scale model that satisfies these. Important dimensionless quantities are called first-order <b>dimensional</b> <b>requirements.</b> A model that satisfies first-order similarity is called an adequate model. Finally, for scale models that fail to satisfy {{one or more of the}} first-order requirements, the name distorted model is given.|$|R
