Because of these questions and concerns, a study was initiated to study the inhibition of complex anaerobic cultures by organic priority pollutants;Twenty-four compounds considered to be representative of the semivolatile organic priority pollutants were selected for testing. A batch bioassay technique using serum bottles was used to determine inhibitory effects from these compounds. Anaerobic seed was obtained from a laboratory digester maintained on a synthetic substrate resembling municipal refuse. Suppression of gas production provided evidence of inhibition. All inhibition evaluations were performed at 37 (DEGREES) C;Of the twenty-four organic chemicals tested, only seven produced significant inhibition at concentrations of 100 mg/L or less. These seven were nitrobenzene, 4 -nitrophenol, 2 -nitrophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, hexachloroethane, <b>hexachlorocyclopentadiene</b> and hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene. Reversible inhibition was observed for all compounds except 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene;Recovery of methane production in anaerobic cultures inhibited by the nitro organics was due to biological reduction of the nitro group to an amine group. Aniline was positively identified as the degradation product of nitrobenzene. Since the amine group is relatively nontoxic compared to the nitro group, recovery occurred;Adsorption of the chlorinated hydrocarbons onto the solids in the anaerobic cultures was a major removal mechanism. Recovery of gas production in cultures inhibited by hexachloroethane was due to acclimation of anaerobic microorganisms to the low concentrations of this compound remaining in solution after removal by adsorption. However, gas production did not recover in cultures inhibited by hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene even though the concentration was significantly reduced by adsorption.

This article presents the results of an experimental study on the non-oxidative thermal decomposition of endosulfan. The objective of the study was to identify its decomposition pathways and to gain an understanding into the formation of toxic species which may be introduced in the environment during its thermal decomposition. The experiments were conducted using a tubular reactor placed in a three zone heating furnace and operated with a dilute heated stream of endosulfan vapour in 99. 999 % helium. Gaseous species such as HCl, CO, C₂H₂ and SO₂ were detected and quantified by online Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopic analysis.

Exposure to allyl chloride (AC), 1, 3 -dichloropropene (DCP), epichlorohydrin (ECH), and <b>hexachlorocyclopentadiene</b> (HEX) has regularly been determined by personal air monitoring since 1980. Although exposures to DCP and ECH were well below currently accepted maximum allowable concentrations (MACs), relatively high exposures to AC and HEX, occasionally exceeding the MAC, have been measured. The results of the kidney and liver function tests were compared with those of a control group comprising 35 men employed at the materials division and not occupationally exposed to chemicals. Biochemical alterations of liver function were assessed by determination in serum of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALAT, ASAT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), total bilirubin (BIL), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total bile acids (SBA). No differences between the exposed group and the control group were found. Nor were differences found in biochemical tests for renal tubular damage (urinary alanine aminopeptidase (AAP) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and renal tubular function (urinary retinol binding protein (RBP). Total urinary protein and albumin excretion were measured to assess the integrity of the glomerulus. Urinary total protein did not differ between the groups, but urinary albumin, although within normal limits in both groups, was significantly higher (p < 0. 02) in the exposed group. This difference in urinary albumin could not simply be explained by exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons because albumin concentrations did not correlate with the duration of employment.

40|$|General methodologies are {{elaborated}} for the {{modification of}} residual vinyl groups {{resulting from the}} polymerization of technical grade divinylbenzene to obtain polymer supported reagents, catalysts, protecting groups, separation media and chemosensors. These residual vinyl groups undergo anti-Markovnikov addition reactions via free-radical mechanisms to give polymer supported halides, sulfides, phosphines, phophonates, amines, silanes, carboxylic acid derivatives such as amides, amidines, esters and also b -diketones, crown ethers or acetals. Reaction of these pendant styryl units via electrophilic or nucleophilc mechanisms also give useful polymeric products. Diels-Alder reactions of the pendant styryl units are also investigated, showing that these may react as dienophiles or, with {{the participation of the}} aromatic group, as a diene. Thus, one mole of diene such as <b>hexachlorocyclopentadiene</b> or 3, 6 -dipyridyl- 1, 2, 4, 5 tetrazine add per mole of alkene, or two moles of dienophile such as maleic acid derivatives add in a fashion analogous to the Wagner-Jauregg reaction. Transition metal catalysed hydrosilylation of the substrate (vinyl) polystyrene using Co 2 (CO) 8 gives exclusively dimethylene linked polymer supported dialkylchlorosilanes. These may be used to selectively protect primary hydroxyls in the presence of secondary or tertiary hydroxyls. Cleavage of the silyl ethers can be effected with aqueous acid, base or more conveniently with fluoride ions which then could be regenerated back to the polymeric silylchlorides using BCl 3 /CH 2 Cl 2. Resins bearing amino acid functionalities, obtained by free-radical addition of cysteine, may be converted to polymer supported azlactones which smoothly immobilize enzymes such as lipase, and retain their hydrolytic activity. Functional polymer particles of nanometer dimensions bearing fluorescent molecular imprinted sites are obtained using a core-shell polymerization approach in conjunction with technique described above. The resulting clear particle dispersions show some ability to distinguish between molecules and even between enantiomers through weak interactions, as shown by fluorescence spectroscopy.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 In {{this study}} {{a number of}} cage alkenes were {{synthesised}} and tested for activity towards ringopening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) with the commercially available catalysts 55 (Grubbs-I) and 56 (Grubbs-II). The first group of monomers are derivatives of tetracyclo[6. 3. 0. 04, 1105, 9]undec- 2 -en- 6 -one (1). The synthesis of these cage alkenes are summarised in Scheme 7. 1. The cage alkene 126 b was synthesised by a Diels-Alder reaction between 1 and <b>hexachlorocyclopentadiene</b> (9, Scheme 7. 2). The geometry of 126 b was determined from XRD data. Knowledge of the geometry of 126 b also established the geometry of 127 since conformational changes during the conversion from 126 b to 127 are unlikely. Synthesis of the cage alkene 125 by the cycloaddition of 9 to 118 failed. The cage alkene exo- 11 - hydroxy- 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 16 -hexachlorohexacyclo[7. 6. 1. 03, 8. 02, 13. 010, 14]hexa-dec- 5 -ene (124, Scheme 7. 3) could therefore not be prepared. Synthesis of 125 by reduction of 126 b with various reduction systems was not successful. Theoretical aspects of these reactions were investigated with molecular modelling. A {{possible explanation for the}} unreactive nature of 126 b towards reduction is presented, but the lack of reactivity of 118 towards 9 eluded clear explanations. The synthesis of cage alkenes from 4 -isopropylidenepentacyclo[5. 4. 0. 02, 6. 03, 10. 05, 9]-undecane- 8, 11 - dione (23) did not meet with much success (Scheme 7. 4). Numerous synthetic methods were investigated to affect the transformation from 134 a/ 134 b to 135 (Scheme 7. 5). These attempts evolved into theoretical investigations to uncover the reasons for the observed reactivity. Possible explanations were established by considering the differences and similarities between the geometries and electronic structures of reactive and unreactive cage alcohols. ROMP of cage monomers based on 1 were mostly unsuccessful. Only the cage monomer 127 showed some reactivity. Endocyclic cage monomers with a tetracycloundecane (TCU) framework showed no reactivity. The results from NMR experiments verified the experimental results. Hexacyclo[8. 4. 0. 02, 9. 03, 13. 04, 7. 04, 12]tetradec- 5 -en- 11, 14 -dione (3) exhibited notable ROMP reactivity. Examination of the orbitals of the cage alkenes used in this study suggested that the reactivity of 1 and 3 could possibly be enhanced by removal of the carbonyl groups. Decarbonylation of 1 and 3 yielded the cage hydrocarbons 159 and 175, respectively. ROMP tests revealed that 175 is an excellent monomer, but 159 was unreactive. The results obtained for the ROMP reactions in this study was rationalised by considering aspects such as ring strain, energy profiles, steric constraints, and frontier orbital theory. The concept of ring strain is less useful when describing the reactivity of cage alkenes towards ROMP and therefore the concepts of fractional ring strain and fractional ring strain energy (RSEf) were developed. A possible link between RSEf and the ROMP reactivity of cage alkenes was also established. The following criteria were put forth to predict the reactivity or explain the lack of reactivity of cage alkenes towards ROMP reactions with Grubbs-I and Grubbs-II. The criteria for ROMP of cage monomers: 1. Sufficient fractional ring strain energy (RSEf). 2. A reasonable energy profile when compared to a reference compound such as cyclopentene. 3. Ability to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate with reasonable distances between different parts of the cage fragment. 4. Sufficient ability of the polymer fragment to take on a conformation that exposes the catalytic site. 5. Sufficient size, shape, orientation and energy of HOMO and/or NHOMO at the alkene functionality of the cage monomer and of the LUMO at the catalytic site. Doctora...|$|E
