500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want next to you? You want Colonel Tigh 'cause he is gonna <b>get</b> <b>your</b> <b>ass</b> out of there." [...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E

It's hard-fought and not without causalitiesalong the way, but we've already seen that time can be affected. Whether it can be changed enough - or how Time might account for those changes - are some of the central questions of the show. It's also possible that all of this is a closed loop with several loops inside that loop."
