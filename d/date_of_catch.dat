40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of investigations conducted in 2004 - 2007 to evaluate the residual effect of summer catch crops ploughed as green manures on productive-economic effects of sweet corn cultiva-tion. The experiment was carried out in east-central Poland (52 ° 03 ’N, 22 ° 33 ’E). The following summer catch crops were grown: phacelia, am-aranth, sunflower, serradella and faba bean. The catch crop seeds were sown in 2004 - 2006 at three dates: on the 21 stJuly, 4 th and 18 th August. The effect of summer catch crops was compared to FYM applied at the rate of 40 t·ha- 1. The catch crops biomass (roots + above ground parts) and FYM were incorporated in the third decade of October. Sweet corn seeds (6 kg·ha- 1) were sown in mid-May, in the years 2005 - 2007, at the between – and in-ter-row spacing of 65 × 20 cm. Sweet corn ears were hand-harvested at the stage of milk maturity of kernels, at the turn of August and Septem-ber. During the harvest marketable yield of ears (t·ha- 1) and number of marketable ears per 1 ha were determined. Economic evaluation of sweet corn cultivation under diversified organic fertilization was conducted ac-cording to the standard gross margin method. The calculation was based on the 2014 prices. The highest yield and number of ears were obtained after catch crops with faba bean and phacelia sown on the 21 st July and after FYM. Delaying the sowing <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops resulted in a decrease in the successive yielding effect. The highest gross margin (25267. 66 PLN·ha- 1 and 0. 56 PLN per 1 ear) and profitability index (332 %) were achieved in the sweet corn cultivation after catch crop with faba bean sown on the 21 st July.

The orchards were newly planted or established, had widely varying apple leaf midge populations and {{were subjected to}} different pesticide management regimes. The Julian <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the peak <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> midges in the sex pheromone traps increased approximately linearly with increasing generation number. There was also a strong increasing relationship between the Julian <b>date</b> <b>of</b> peak <b>catch</b> and increasing absolute value of latitude. A linear relationship was fitted {{within the range of}} 41 - 51 degrees latitude included. Strong linear relationships on log-log transformed scales were found between the total and peak numbers of midges caught per generation and the populations of galls that developed subsequently. The best fit of log 10 (total galls/ha)  =  2. 138  + log 10 (total no. midges caught/generation) was obtained for the first and second generations. The relationship indicates that each male midge caught in a trap for a particular generation corresponds to approximately 137 galls being formed per hectare subsequently for that generation, providing that there are sufficient shoots and tender young leaves present to accommodate them. Clearly the proportion of shoots and leaves galled per hectare will depend on the numbers of shoots and leaves present in the particular orchard but knowledge of these parameters should allow simple estimates to be made. The regressions were significantly weakened when the third and especially the fourth generations were included, largely because of gall saturation or because tree growth had ceased. The relationships were not significantly affected by pesticide management regime, orchard age or country of location. In a further study, a good correspondence was found between pheromone trap catches and the percentage of shoots infested with eggs of D. mali for the first and second generation in an experimental orchard in Kent during 2006. The results indicate that the sex pheromone traps are effective for monitoring the flight activity of successive generations of D. mali, can be used to predict the severity of galling attacks to shoots and are likely to be useful for timing insecticide sprays...|$|R

As a preparation it was considered useful {{to look at the}} available historical information regarding fin whale presence off GaIicia. Some observations about fin whaIe feeding are aIso presented here. The catch statistics for 1952 - 1985 were analysed for pattems of seasonal distribution. Information about the geographic distribution of fin whaIes was obtained from positions in the catch statistics, from sightings made by the whaling boats and from severaI sighting surveys. These positions were represented in charts with bathymetric profiles to visualise the distribution of whales in relation with the sea bottom topography. The prey species found in the stomachs of 17 individuaIs caught during the 1983 season were identified and their degree of digestion and semi-quantitative abundance evaIuated. Throughout the historie series more than 70 % ofthe catches occur between July and September. Some temporal distributional pattems can be described along the time series and in relation with annual values ofNAO and Gulf Stream indices. Positions <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> and sightings data were plotted by months and compared to show the seasonal distribution and reIative movements of fin whaIes. Only 3 of the 17 stomachs were empty. The prey most commonly found (85. 7 % of the stomachs with food) was the euphausiid Meganycthiphanes norvegica. One whale has only the gadoid fish Micromesistius poutassou and another whale a mixture of both items.

40|$|Interactions between host {{plants and}} aphids under water stress {{conditions}} were examined. Two controlled environment room studies, a Veld experiment and phenological modelling analysis {{were used to}} investigate three different plant-aphid relationships. The aim of these studies {{was to determine the}} results of water shortage on plant and pest populations, which are likely to result under climate change scenarios. The central hypothesis was that mild drought stress would lead to greater aphid populations through a beneficial increase of small nitrogenous molecules in the phloem sap providing improved diet quality — the Plant Stress Hypothesis (White, 1969). Myzus persicae (the peach–potato aphid) is a broad-range feeder with a preference for senescent foliage. Contrary to expectations, on young cabbage plants, Brassica oleracea var capitata, it was found to increase faster and to a greater extent on well-watered hosts. Aphids were also found to prevent osmoregulation in droughted plants. Despite this, the aphid infestation led to a drought-like response in all plants irrespective of watering regime, causing significantly reduced growth. Metopolophium dirhodum (the rose–grain aphid) overwinters as eggs on Rosa spp. but most of its life-cycle is spent on grasses and cereal crops. As with M. persicae, aphid infestation caused drought-like symptoms even in well-watered plants. The mechanism of reduction in plant health is most likely through aphid damage to the efficiency of Photosystem a within 7 days of infestation. On young barley plants, Hordeum vulgare, the rose–grain aphid was found to increase faster and to greater extent on droughted hosts. In contrast to M. persicae, the study strongly supported the Plant Stress Hypothesis, Finding that even mild water stress of approximately − 0. 3 MPa could lead to conditions favourable to rapid aphid population increase. The difference in the response of different species of aphids may be associated more with the levels of soluble nitrogen in their diet than specifically host plant water status. Drepanosiphum platanoidis is an aphid specific to sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus and spends its entire life-cycle on that species. In the Veld, the total number of aphids supported by a single tree was found to correlate most strongly with soluble leaf nitrogen. In addition, the number of aphids on individual leaves was found to correlate strongly and negatively with stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. Finally, analysis of historical aphid suction-trap data was carried out. UK Rothamsted suction-traps are 12. 2 m tall and sample air at 0. 75 m 3 s- 1, with daily aphid sampling between April and November. The traps are designed to catch the largest proportion of aphids in the total insect sample and to reduce the effect of surrounding land-use on the sample. The area represented by a trap may be as much as 700 km 2 (Harrington and Woiwod, 2007). The dataset is the longest and most geographically extensive for aphid populations, comprising 46 sites across Europe as of 2011. In this analysis, aphid and meteorological data from the Edinburgh East Craigs site were used. This also enabled comparison with D. platanoidis numbers collected in the Veld, which showed a strongly significant positive relationship between the two. Since the data collected in suction-traps are correlated with numbers in the Veld, aphid population analysis can be improved with use of these longer datasets, without reliance on shorter-term Veld surveys. The various population characteristics examined were found to be strongly correlated with each other, but were unconnected to data from previous years. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first <b>catch</b> was found to be significantly advancing over time, with strong influences from daily minimum temperatures and vapour pressure deficits of the air within the year. Higher temperatures with lower humidity tend to bring forward the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first <b>catch.</b> Lower tends to depress the population in the summer. The overall hypothesis that mild drought would benefit aphid populations cannot be accepted, but in two cases of the experiment sections of the work there were strong relationships between aphid numbers and both leaf temperature and soil moisture. The meteorological data analysis indicates that climatic changes towards a hotter, drier climate could substantially alter population dynamics. Harrington, R. and Woiwod, I. (2007).
