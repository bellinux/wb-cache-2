40|$|Abstract—Advances in CMOS image sensors enable {{high-speed}} image readout, {{which makes}} it possible to capture multiple images within a normal exposure time. Earlier work has demonstrated the use of this capability to <b>enhance</b> sensor <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> This paper presents an algorithm for synthesizing a high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> motion blur free, still image from multiple captures. The algorithm consists of two main procedures, photocurrent estimation and saturation and motion detection. Estimation is used to reduce read noise, and, thus, to <b>enhance</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> at the low illumination end. Saturation detection is used to <b>enhance</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> at the high illumination end as previously proposed, while motion blur detection ensures that the estimation is not corrupted by motion. Motion blur detection also {{makes it possible to}} extend exposure time and to capture more images, which can be used to further <b>enhance</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> at the low illumination end. Our algorithm operates completely locally; each pixel’s final value is computed using only its captured values, and recursively, requiring the storage of only a constant number of values per pixel independent of the number of images captured. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> and the motion blur prevention achieved using the algorithm.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} retina has a {{very high}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> This {{is due to the}} concerted action of its diverse cell types. Ganglion cells, which are the output cells of the retina, have to preserve this high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> to convey it to higher brain areas. Experimental evidence shows that the firing response of ganglion cells is strongly correlated with their total dendritic area and only weakly correlated with their dendritic branching complexity. On the other hand, theoretical studies with simple neuron models claim that active and large dendritic trees <b>enhance</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of single neurons. Theoretical models also claim that electrical coupling between ganglion cells via gap junctions <b>enhances</b> their collective <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> In this work we use morphologically reconstructed multi-compartmental ganglion cell models to perform two studies.

40|$|CMOS image sensors {{generally}} suer {{from lower}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> than CCDs {{due to their}} higher readout noise. Their high speed readout capability and the potential of integrating memory and signal processing with the sensor on the same chip, open up many possibilities for <b>enhancing</b> their <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> Earlier work have demonstrated {{the use of multiple}} non-destructive samples to <b>enhance</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> while achieving higher SNR than using other <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> enhancement schemes. The high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image is constructed by appropriately scaling each pixel's last sample before saturation. Conventional CDS is used to reduce oset FPN and reset noise. This simple high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image construction scheme, however, does not take full advantage of the multiple samples. Readout noise power, which doubles as a result of performing CDS, remains as high as in conventional sensor operation. As a result <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is only extended at the high illumination end. The paper explores the use of linear mean-square-error estimation to more fully exploit the multiple pixel samples to reduce readout noise and thus extend <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> at the low illumination end. We present three estimation algorithms: (1) a recursive estimator when reset noise and oset FPN are ignored, (2) a non-recursive algorithm when reset noise and FPN are considered, and (3) a recursive estimation algorithm for case (2), which achieves mean square error close to the non-recursive algorithm without the need to store all the samples. The later recursive algorithm is attractive since it requires the storage of only a few pixel values per pixel, which makes its implementation in a single chip digital imaging system feasible. 1...|$|R
