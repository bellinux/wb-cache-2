25|$|By mid-century, railroads {{had begun}} to eclipse canals in the United States, {{although}} the Morris Canal remained in heavy use through the 1860s. It was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1871, {{taken over by the}} state of New Jersey late in 1922, and formally abandoned in 1924. This was a common fate in the era for many enterprises formerly reliant on anthracite volumeby the 1920s, oil fuels had been steadily eroding the market share of anthracite in heating, and the automobiles were becoming common, whilst World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> a boost to motor truck (Lorry) development.|$|E
500|$|Boycott {{headed the}} {{national}} batting averages in 1972 with 72.35, and {{was second in}} 1973 with 63.62. In 1973, however, Yorkshire failed to win any of the 8 championship games with Boycott in charge, and Wisden called the season [...] "disturbingly unsuccessful". [...] It led to further calls for Boycott to be stripped of the captaincy. He was also coming into increased conflict with Richard Hutton, Close, and {{several members of the}} committee and senior players. [...] "Looking back," [...] Boycott wrote in 1987 [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up the Yorkshire captaincy {{at the end of that}} year." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E

2500|$|Looking back in 1902, Debussy {{explained}} the protracted genesis of his only finished opera: [...] "For {{a long time}} I had been striving to write music for the theatre, but the form in which I {{wanted it to be}} was so unusual that after several attempts <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up on the idea." [...] There were many false starts before Pelléas et Mélisande. In the 1880s the young composer had toyed with several opera projects (Diane au Bois, Axël) before accepting a libretto on the theme of El Cid, entitled Rodrigue et Chimène, from the poet and Wagner aficionado Catulle Mendès.|$|E
2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes {{for a few seconds}} only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} to Pine Ridge in 1905, Standing Bear {{was chosen as}} a chief of the Oglala Lakota on July 4, 1905. There was a great celebration. “In different places they started to sing songs of praise for me. [...] Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things I had brought along. I kept this up until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> away everything I owned, and my wife and I walked away with practically nothing. [...] We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|At a party held at Simmons' {{residence}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles {{to celebrate the}} success of The Robe, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, {{who at the time}} was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being [...] "rather full of himself. I seem to remember that he never stopped talking, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> him the cold fish eye." [...] Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: [...] "I never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove what metal was therein.

[...] I did so, and within three days again he showed me more powder of gold. [...] I told him I would not believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that I marvelled much of his doings sith <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> pieces to other 3 to make proof who could find no such thing there.
