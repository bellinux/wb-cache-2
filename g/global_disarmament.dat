According to Alexander Rodger, as a result of the decision not to re-raise pioneer battalions in the interwar years, no battle honours were subsequently awarded to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion– or any other First World War pioneer battalion– as there was no equivalent unit to perpetuate the honours when they were promulgated by the Australian Army in 1927.|$|E

50|$|Resources {{for peace}} could be {{obtained}} by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could {{go hand in hand}} with plans for <b>global</b> <b>disarmament</b> and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for <b>global</b> <b>disarmament,</b> even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.|$|E

50|$|The Buddhist Peace Fellowship (BPF) is a nonsectarian {{international}} network of engaged Buddhists participating {{in various forms}} of nonviolent social activism and environmentalism. The nonprofit BPF is an affiliate of the international Fellowship of Reconciliation working toward <b>global</b> <b>disarmament</b> and peace, helping individuals suffering under governmental tyranny {{in places such as}} Burma, Bangladesh, Tibet and Vietnam. Currently headquartered in Oakland, California, BPF was incorporated in 1978 in Hawaii by Robert Baker Aitken, his wife Anne Hopkins Aitken, Nelson Foster, Ryo Imamura and others. Shortly after other notable individuals joined, including Gary Snyder, Alfred Bloom, Joanna Macy and Jack Kornfield. Generally speaking, the BPF has a tendency to approach social issues from a left-wing perspective and, while the fellowship is nonsectarian, the majority of its members are practitioners of Zen.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Department of National Defence {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about participation in the program. It wished to retain {{the current level of}} Canadian involvement in North American air defence through NORAD, but was reluctant to see scarce military funds spent on a single large research and development project of dubious practical value. There was a widespread feeling in Canada that failure to participate in the program would mean being shut out of American defense planning, something that would not be in the Canadian national interest. Others feared that rejection of the plan would lead to a cooling of Canada-U.S. relations, and might even lead to reprisals. Thus, while some Canadians were unsure about the viability of the system, many supported joining for diplomatic reasons. Opponents of involvement replied that Canada must have the courage to oppose the system on moral grounds, even if this decision proved to have negative consequences. They contended that it was important for Canada to reestablish its voice in the international arena by pushing for <b>global</b> <b>disarmament</b> and a revitalization of the United Nations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, {{the chief}} {{delegate}} of India at the time, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was elected {{the first woman}} President of the UN General Assembly. India supported the struggle towards <b>global</b> <b>disarmament</b> and {{the ending of the}} arms race, and towards the creation of a more equitable international economic order. India had a mediatory role in resolving the stalemate over prisoners of war in Korea contributing to the signing of the armistice ending the Korean War in 1953. India chaired the five-member Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission while the Indian Custodian Force supervised the process of interviews and repatriation that followed. India then went on to chair the three international commissions for supervision and control for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos established by the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina. India also had an active role to play in the Suez Crisis in 1956 with the role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime minister and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement being significant. Indian historian Inder Malhotra wrote that [...] "Now Nehru—who had tried to be even-handed between the two sides—denounced Eden and co-sponsors of the aggression vigorous. He had a powerful, if relatively silent, ally in the US president Dwight D. Eisenhower who went to the extent of using America's clout in the IMF to make Eden and Mollet behave".|$|E
40|$|What {{can we do}} to {{stop the}} {{armament}} race and promote peace? And in particular, what can we scientists do? The obvious risk for nuclear disaster makes it necessary for any scientist to scrutinize his/her own resources, and to try new unconventional ways to contribute to <b>global</b> <b>disarmament</b> and a reasonable future. One of these resources is the scientist’s own personal appreciation of right and wrong, i. e. our ethics. In the following we shall describe an attempt to mobilize this resource in order to affect the choice of research field and applica-tion of research. At Uppsala University a small group of scientists has met regularly since 1981 t...|$|E
50|$|Throughout history, marches {{have been}} {{associated}} with political and social change.

5000|$|The Great Peace March for <b>Global</b> Nuclear <b>Disarmament,</b> which Mixner {{would later}} call his “biggest {{political}} failure and his biggest regret” ultimately left Los Angeles on March 1, 1986 with only 1200 marchers.

By 1988, the “Doomsday Clock” was back up to six minutes and continued rising as East-West relations improved, although it has since gone back down to five minutes, as of 2007.|$|R

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{globalization}} are reviewed. It is noted {{that money and}} goods move freely but people may not. A distinction is made between proactive and reactive migrants, recognizing {{that this is a}} continuum not a dichotomy. The global system is characterized by extreme inequality, as measured by GDP per head, and by the Human Development Index. The majority of armed conflicts occur in poorest countries, which are also the source of most political refugees. Environmental crises also precipitate population displacement. Developing countries carry the main burden of refugee protection. Asylum seekers in industrialized regions are a small proportion of those needing protection world-wide. It is concluded that the global refugee crisis will only be solved, in the long-run, by reducing inequality, and addressing the question of <b>global</b> <b>disarmament...</b>|$|E
40|$|Performer: Pacific Forum CSIS Project Leads: Brad Glosserman Project Cost: $ 207, 000 FY 15 - 16 Objective: Building on {{the results}} of {{previous}} trilateral meetings among the U.

This strategic dialogue will investigate opportunities and obstacles to U. S. -Japan-ROK trilateral cooperation that could enhance or hamper extended deterrence among the U. S. and its two allies in Northeast Asia. This initiative will explore ways the three countries could work together to secure their national interests and reinforce the U. S. extended deterrent.
