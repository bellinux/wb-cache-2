5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to the communists. The communists had already captured more than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's {{contiguity}} with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all-time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E

25|$|As stipulated at the Jimaguayú Assembly {{two years}} earlier, a second Constituent Assembly met in La Yaya, Camagüey, on 10 October 1897.

Thereafter, Madrid decided to change its policy toward Cuba, replacing Weyler, drawing up a colonial constitution for Cuba and Puerto Rico, and installing a new government in Havana.

Only around 16,000 soldiers were pulled out, and of the almost two million civilians that packed Đà Nẵng, a little more than 50,000 were evacuated. As a result, 70,000 troops were taken prisoner, along with around 100 fighter jets. Trưởng and his officers swam to a boat in the sea and evacuated to Saigon.
