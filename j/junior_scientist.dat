5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory had a {{governing}} board, {{the members of}} which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, George Kistiakowsky and Kenneth Bainbridge were later added. The laboratory was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a <b>junior</b> <b>scientist</b> or technician.|$|E

Sample of respondents included 88 beginners: postgraduate students (n= 65) and masters (n= 23) of Tomsk high schools aged between 21 and 35 years. As research methods the expanded version of technique by M. Rokeach (proposed by M. S. Yanitsky and A. V. Seryy), methods of statistical analysis of results (frequency analysis, Mann-Whitney test) were used. Relevant value orientations of <b>junior</b> <b>scientists</b> are presented. Gender differences in value-meaning domain are revealed. Differences in values in postgraduate students and masters were found. Dissonance in degree of fulfillment of terminal and instrumental values has been established that indicates disturbances of value-meaning domain of the personality of <b>junior</b> <b>scientists.</b> Results add to scientific ideas about value-meaning barriers in research activity of <b>junior</b> <b>scientists...</b>|$|R

40|$|The crux of {{the problem}} is that many <b>junior</b> <b>scientists</b> focus all their time and efforts on {{producing}} results, and do not consider how to acquire additional skills. Even more importantly, they communicate poorly or not at all with each other, with their superiors or with society at large. This is a crucial point. Good communication helps not only to obtain additional skills and experience, but also to share information and expertise with those who pursue activities outside research. In fact, there are <b>junior</b> <b>scientists</b> who engage in various extracurricular initiatives to expand their horizons and increase their skills. Others have succeeded in using this experience to find interesting, secure and well-paid positions outside science. Yet few PhD students or postdoctoral researchers are aware of this...|$|R

She {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal, majoring in Biology with a specialization in Evolution.
