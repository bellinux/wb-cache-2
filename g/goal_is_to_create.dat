25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the county}} has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that {{requires}} developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County {{was one of the}} first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, but many other areas have since followed suit.|$|E

25|$|Applications whose <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{a system}} that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the {{possibility}} of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when {{the capacity of the}} network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. The second is to use some form of regularization. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.|$|E

500|$|The city's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a mixed-use {{development}} with green space and affordable housing. By April 2017, a special committee had narrowed {{the search for}} a plan and site developer down to five proposals. In May 2017, the Barry administration selected a proposal called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and backed by music producer T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-acre site includes music and art space, a community center, open park space, and affordable housing. The footprint of the baseball diamond and outfield would be turned into the Great Lawn, a [...] green space accommodating amateur baseball and soccer. Renderings show the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield wall intact. The plan, which awaits final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, has been met with concerns by citizens and groups whom would rather see the property restored entirely to parkland and the site's history preserved. Other concerns have been raised over the lack of transparency in the city's planning process and the privatization of publicly owned land.|$|E
