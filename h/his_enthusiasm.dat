5|$|Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro: Hopkins {{was cast}} in December 1996, one month before filming began. Hopkins, known for his {{dramatic}} acting, took up the role over <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> {{to be in an}} action film.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{complied}} with Bolt's demand {{to run in}} the 100 m, and he was entered to run the event at the 23rd Vardinoyiannia meeting in Rethymno, Crete. In his debut tournament run, he set a personal best of 10.03 s, winning the gold medal and feeding <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the event.|$|E
5|$|Such reenactment pantomimes became {{hugely popular}} and spread {{throughout}} Christendom. Within {{a hundred years}} every church in Italy was {{expected to have a}} nativity scene at Christmastime. Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings. Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> encouraged others to do the same.|$|E
60|$|The {{peculiar}} look {{came into}} Bosinney's face which marked all <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But her {{gratification}} {{in being}} admitted to <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> {{was only a}} background for her flare when he boldly caught up her white paw and muttered, [...] "Tired little hand that has to work so hard!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} the {{foundation}} was first raised in 1960 by Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, the founder of Publicis. Roger Forthomme, a Belgian journalist, succeeded in conveying <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> for the foundation to Emile Bernheim, who founded the Belgian Vocation Foundation in 1963.|$|R
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head shared <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> in {{signing the}} young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
60|$|They were gone. Carl {{was full}} of the nauseating shame which a matter-of-fact man, who supposes that he is never pilloried, knows when a {{conscientious}} friend informs him {{that he has been}} observed, criticized; that <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> have been regarded as eccentricities; his affectionate approaches toward friendship as impertinence.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> boyhood <b>enthusiasms</b> {{included}} cricket, literature, horse-racing and showbusiness.|$|R
60|$|Monmouth felt <b>his</b> sudden <b>enthusiasm</b> chilled by {{that tone}} and manner.|$|R
5|$|Grainger left Australia {{at the age}} of 13 {{to attend}} the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he {{established}} himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for which he often expressed in private letters.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, {{the couple}} created the double {{portrait}} (pictured above) {{in which they}} painted each other. The same year they travelled to Italy where they continued their honeymoon in Ravello and Amalfi. The small oil-on-canvas work Interior. Marie Krøyer painting. Ravello shows Marie painting while they were there. They also visited the artist Kristian Zahrtmann who spent his summers in the house he had bought in Civita d'Antino, {{high up in the}} mountains in the Abruzzo region some 150km (90 miles) south of Rome. Thanks to <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm,</b> the town became a favourite destination for Scandinavian painters. In addition to Marie, the lunch scene includes Zahrtmann and Krøyer himself.|$|E
60|$|We {{ended the}} day by singing for him--that {{was the best of}} it all; for both the {{children}} could now join with me in voicing the tunes which he loved. They knew <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> and were already faithful heirs of his traditions. Singers of the future, they loved to hear him recount the past.|$|R
500|$|Benson gently {{declined}} Walpole's advances. They remained friends, but Walpole, rebuffed in his [...] "excessive {{desire to}} be loved", turned {{the full force of}} <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> elsewhere, and the relationship with Benson became less important to him. Less than two years later Benson's diary entry on Walpole's subsequent social career reveals his thoughts on his protégé's progress: ...|$|R

5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} swim in the ocean and he quickly lost <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
50|$|Thubron's {{strength}} of character could overdetermine student responses, and <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> yawed abruptly from philosophy to mathematical sculpture or to expressive painting. Young followers whom he appointed to the staff found themselves with much reading. With their preconceptions under assault by his methods and their ideas {{at the mercy of}} his forceful personality, some students, perhaps particularly women students, foundered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{host of the}} show, Dennis Gage, {{is known}} for <b>his</b> {{seemingly}} boundless <b>enthusiasm,</b> <b>his</b> trademark handlebar moustache and the catchphrase with which he ends every episode, [...] "Honor the timeless classics." ...|$|R
60|$|Shefford did {{not respond}} with <b>his</b> usual <b>enthusiasm,</b> and the {{omission}} caused the trader to scrutinize him closely.|$|R
5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the project, Beloso sold Byne {{the stones}} for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price {{roughly equivalent to}} $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|Bowie studied art, {{music and}} design, {{including}} layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, {{introduced him to}} modern jazz, <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother {{to give him a}} Grafton saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician. Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour. Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.|$|E
60|$|Kennicott {{had five}} hobbies: medicine, land-investment, Carol, motoring, and hunting. It {{is not certain}} in what order he {{preferred}} them. Solid though <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> were {{in the matter of}} medicine--his admiration of this city surgeon, his condemnation of that for tricky ways of persuading country practitioners to bring in surgical patients, his indignation about fee-splitting, his pride in a new X-ray apparatus--none of these beatified him as did motoring.|$|R

5|$|His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, {{died from}} lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a {{four-year}} struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas {{to spend more}} time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1943, Lukačević's Chetniks {{participated in}} Operation Kugelblitz, {{the first of}} a series of German {{operations}} alongside the 1st Mountain Division, 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, and parts of the 187th Reserve Division, the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division and the 24th Bulgarian Division. The Partisans avoided decisive engagement and the operation concluded on 18 December. Also during December, the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Sandžak, SS-Standartenführer Karl von Krempler, posted notices authorising local Serbs to join Lukačević's Chetniks. On 22 December, shortly after the conclusion of Operation Kugelblitz, Oberst (Colonel) Josef Remold issued an order of the day commending Lukačević for <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> in fighting the Partisans in the Sandžak, and allowed him to keep some of the arms he had captured.|$|E
5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was selected because of <b>his</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E
