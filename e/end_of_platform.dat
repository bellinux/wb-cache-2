5|$|Platform 11 was a bay platform, {{set back}} at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Platform</b> 9, and curving sharply to the east.|$|E
5|$|At the {{far north}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 4 are {{the remains of the}} Ladywell Sidings, most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{platform}}</b> 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. It follows the original {{alignment of the}} main platform before the 1903 expansion.|$|E
50|$|The station {{consists}} of three elevated island platforms serving six tracks, with the station building located underneath. Platforms 7 and 8 are situated at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> 1 and 2, and platforms 9 and 10 are situated at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> 3 and 4 respectively.|$|R

5|$|The {{concourse}} stretches {{across the}} heads of platforms 1 to 12, underneath the London end of the four train sheds. Platform 14 can only be reached indirectly via the north-western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 12. A footbridge crosses the north-western end of the station and gives access to platforms 1–12 and 14. There are ticket barriers to platforms 2–5 and 10–16.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E

25|$|Also {{during the}} 1901–1905 rebuild {{a series of}} sidings was created {{at the end of}} Platforms 11 and 12 on the bridge over the River Clyde. These were named West Bank Siding, Mid Bank Siding and East Bank Siding. A dock siding – No. 14 Dock was created at the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Platform</b> 13.|$|E
25|$|Trains departing towards Proof House Junction (a end) can {{depart from}} any platform, {{but there are}} {{restrictions}} on trains departing from the b end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5–12 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There {{are a number of}} sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 12 have been removed during the current rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} {{undergone}} several improvements in recent years, with the footbridge (which links both entrances and all platforms) improved by {{removal of the}} central barrier to allow use of its full width, new lifts {{for the use of}} disabled persons, as well as newly painted and brightly illuminated waiting rooms. In recent years the two-track reversing sidings (used for turning Bakerloo line trains and occasionally for DC line trains) located between the tracks of the DC line at the northern end side of the station have been replaced by a single siding and the curve at the Down <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 2 eased using the space vacated by the removed siding; this in practice leaves the siding unavailable for use by LO trains except when Bakerloo trains are not running. Harrow and Wealdstone (with Willesden Junction) is one of the two stations on the DC line which can be used for turning or stabling trains clear of the running lines during reduced or disrupted services although trains can be reversed using crossovers at more stations.|$|E

500|$|On 20 September 1898, 15 {{people were}} injured when a service from Richmond {{approaching}} Broad Street at slightly excessive speed ran into the buffers at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> six. A Board of Trade report on the incident stated: [...] "Fifteen passengers are reported to have complained of bruises or shock, {{and a few others}} have claimed compensation for damage to their hats." [...] The train's driver testified: [...] "I committed an error of judgment in not applying the brake quite soon enough." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{station is}} on an east/west alignment, with the main station {{building}} and car park {{to the north of}} the line. There is a goods yard adjacent to the station to the south, with two loops for trains to pass. The station has three platforms, numbered 2, 3 and 4. Platform 2 is to the south of the two main running lines, and serves westbound trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. Platforms 3 and 4 share an island {{to the north of the}} two main running lines, with a further two running lines between platform 4 and the car park. Platform 3 serves mainly inter-city trains towards London and , while platform 4 is usually reserved for local services. There is a metal wall on platform 2, fencing off the goods yard. An enclosed footbridge provides access to the platforms, approximately a third of the way along platforms 2 and 3 (from west to east), and at the west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 4. Platforms 2 and 3 are opposite each other, while platform 4 is offset from platform 3, starting at the footbridge and extending further to the east. Platform 2 is [...] long, platform 3 is [...] and platform 4 is [...] Platforms 3 and 4 are signalled for bidirectional running, while platform 2 is unidirectional. The footbridge can be accessed by both stairs and lifts.|$|E

2500|$|Platforms 1 and 2 can {{accommodate}} 12-coach trains, and {{were used by}} the express services to [...] and Portsmouth until they were diverted in the early 1980s to serve Gatwick Airport. Nowadays all trains calling at Sutton are formed of ten coaches or fewer. At the London <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 1 there are {{the remains of a}} fifth platform, which was a bay for local services via Mitcham Junction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station has}} 9 platforms, {{numbered}} 1 to 8 and 2C. Platforms 1, 3 and 4 {{are divided into}} a and b sections to allow a brief stabling of terminating services before they are scheduled to depart. The station has four through roads which are used for through running or more commonly for stabling stock. Between platforms 5 and 6 these are known as [...] "1-Up" [...] and [...] "2-Up" [...] (they are on the [...] "Up" [...] or London-bound side of the station) whilst between platforms 1 and 2 are the [...] "through road" [...] with a direct path through the station or by a central crossover to the north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 1 (1b), and [...] "down station siding".|$|E
2500|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> 9 was a [...] sand drag to stop {{over-run}}ning trains. The sand drag was [...] long, [...] on {{the tracks}} {{in front of the}} platform, and [...] inside an over-run tunnel; that tunnel was [...] long, [...] high and [...] wide. The tunnel had been designed to accommodate main line rolling stock and so was wider than the standard tube tunnel width of [...] A buffer (once hydraulic, but not functioning for some time prior to the crash) {{was at the end of}} the tunnel, in front of a solid wall. The approach to Moorgate from Old Street station, the stop prior to the terminus, was on a gradient of 1 in 150 for [...] before levelling out for [...] to platform 9; a scissors crossover was located just prior to platforms 9 and 10.|$|E
50|$|At the {{north-east}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> is a two-lever ground frame. At either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> are timber signs {{displaying the}} name of the station: Spring Bluff.|$|R
