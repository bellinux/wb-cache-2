5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II was {{developed}} by Atlus for the Super Famicom. It was directed by Koji Okada, produced by Hideyuki Yokoyama, and written by Ryutaro Ito, with music composed by Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko designed the game's characters, but was also involved in the planning phase. During the game's pre-production, the development staff visited Hariti's temple in Zōshigaya and Taira no Masakado's grave to cleanse themselves. They had done this before, first during {{the development of the}} first Shin Megami Tensei; after one of the staff members got robbed, they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> regularly. The inspiration to do this came from Go Nagai, who was said to have exorcised a spirit with the help of Hariti while writing the manga Devilman.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of}} the first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} {{as a result of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for an entire year; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier.

We thought about doing something online and after talking with [...] Howard Gordon we <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on air." [...] The working title for the film was 24: Exile, until the change to 24: Redemption.|$|E

500|$|While {{studying}} in the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, Gopalakrishnan {{was influenced by}} the New Wave movement of global cinema and formed a film society in Kerala, named [...] "Chitralekha Film Cooperative", with his classmates in 1965. Gopalakrishnan had initially submitted a romantic script Kamuki to the Film Finance Corporation (now National Film Development Corporation of India or NFDC) which they declined to finance. Later, he submitted the script for Swayamvaram, which Film Finance Corporation accepted and approved the loan of a [...] However, it took seven years for him to get the film rolling, after he passed out of the Film and Television Institute of India. Gopalakrishnan co-scripted the film with writer-director K. P. Kumaran.

500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{a week before the}} game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's {{going to be a very}} interesting game".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay.
