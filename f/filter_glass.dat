25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters.

A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution.

40|$|Abstract: This {{contribution}} {{reports on}} experimental work of four-wave mixing spectroscopy on II-VI semiconductor quantum dots (QD) embedded in glass matrix. Exciton spin dephasing effects {{and the degree}} of asymmetry of CdSxSe 1 -x and CdSe QD’s were investigated by analysing the polarization properties of the time integrated four-wave mixing (TI-FWM) signal. The quantum confinement of carriers in semiconductor quantum dots implies a series of novel physical properties, which were extensively investigated in the last decade. The three-dimensional confinement of excitons leads to large enhancement of the optical nonlinearities and, moreover, quantum dots are known as prototypes for investigation of physics of quantum confinement. The importance of a clear understanding of the physics of such confined systems originates in the large range of application from spinotronics to quantum computation [1, 2]. Recent efforts of the scientist point at the control of spin coherence over a practical length and time scale [3, 4]. We investigated two categories of samples: 1. Schott <b>filter</b> <b>glasses</b> containing CdS 0. 6 Se 0. 4 QD’s embedded in glass matrix and 2. Heat treated Schott <b>filter</b> <b>glasses</b> containing CdSe QD’s.

40|$|The {{wavelength}} dependent {{interaction of}} biological systems with radiation is commonly described by appropriate action spectra. Particularly effective plant responses are obtained for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Excess shortwave UV-B radiation will induce genetic defects and plant damage. Besides the ecological {{discussion of the}} deleterious effects of the excess UV radiation there is increasing interest in horticultural applications of this spectral region. Several metabolic pathways leading to valuable secondary plant products like colors, odors, taste, or resulting in mechanical strength and vitality are triggered by UV radiation. Thus, in ecologically {{as well as in}} economically oriented experiments the exact generation and knowledge of the spectral irradiance, particularly near the UV absorption edge, is essential. The ideal filter 'material' to control the UV absorption edge would be ozone itself. However, due to problems in controlling the toxic and chemically aggressive, instable gas, only rather 'small ozone filters' have been realized so far. In artificial plant lighting conventional solid filter materials such as glass sheets and plastic foils (celluloseacetate or cellulosetriacetate) which can be easily handled have been used to absorb the UV-C and the excess shortwave UV-B radiation of the lamp emissions. Different <b>filter</b> <b>glasses</b> are available which provide absorption properties suitable for gradual changes of the spectral UV-B illumination of artificial lighting. Using a distinct set of lamps and <b>filter</b> <b>glasses</b> an acceptable simulation of the UV-B part of natural global radiation can be achieved. The aging of these and other filter materials under the extreme UV radiation in the lamphouse of a solar simulator is presently unavoidable. This instability can be dealt with only by a precise spectral monitoring and by replacing the filters accordingly. For this reason attempts would be useful to develop real ozone filters which can replace <b>glass</b> <b>filters.</b> In any case chamber experiments require a careful selection of the filter material used and must be accompanied by a continuous UV-B monitoring...|$|R
