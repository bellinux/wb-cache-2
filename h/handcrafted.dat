40|$|This thesis paper {{examines}} how <b>handcraft</b> (making an item by analog means using specific materials) {{can be a}} compelling rhetorical tool for graphic designers to harness. Contrasting <b>handcraft</b> techniques with computer graphics software “unsettles” rote graphic design practices. The meaning that lies in the physical act of making, the materials that are used and the contexts with which particular <b>handcrafts</b> are associated can support, as well as carry, visual rhetoric in design works. An analysis of the unconventional <b>handcraft</b> work produced by Stefan Sagmeister (USA), Mathias Augustyniak and Michaël Amzalag of M/M (Paris) (France), Marian Bantjes (Canada), and by this author (specifically, a design book produced in tandem with this paper) is used to demonstrate how complex meanings contained within <b>handcrafts</b> can be revealed and used in graphic design. The combination of <b>handcraft</b> and digital techniques enables designers to interweave the disparate social, physical and material qualities of the two processes into their work. In this way the work engages in disciplinary and societal discourse...|$|R
