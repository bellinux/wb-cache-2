50|$|<b>Hydronics</b> {{is the use}} of {{a liquid}} heat-transfer medium in heating and cooling systems. The working fluid is {{typically}} water, glycol, or mineral oil. Some of the oldest and most common examples are steam and hot-water radiators. Historically, in large-scale commercial buildings such as high-rise and campus facilities, a hydronic system may include both a chilled and a heated water loop, to provide for both heating and air conditioning. Chillers and cooling towers are used either separately or together as means to provide water cooling, while boilers heat water. A recent innovation is the chiller boiler system, which provides an efficient form of HVAC for homes and smaller commercial spaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the need}} to control complex {{hydronic}} systems, this paper presents and analyzes control strategies for energy efficient thermal load regulation by means of a model-predictive control (MPC) embedded into a low-power wireless controller. Hydronic systems are found {{in a wide variety of}} applications such as building controls, industrial plants, and naval vessels. A laboratory test-bed which models a simple hydronic system is used to assess the proposed control solutions. The key design parameters analyzed by this paper are the form of the objective function and the structure of the model used for open-loop (OL) optimization during each step of the MPC solution. Objective functions were evaluated based on complexity and efficacy in meeting the stated goal of efficient thermal load regulation. The <b>hydronics</b> were modeled as first-order linear differential equations with non-linear time-varying constraints on control, and as bi-linear differential equations in which the control variable is multiplied by the state but constrained linearly. To minimize the objective functions associated with OL trajectories, a gradient descent algorithm was selected which balanced real-time execution with microcontroller (MCU) computing power. Parametric studies were performed in simulation and experiment to show that a low-power MCU could be used to efficiently control hydronic plants using MPC. I...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) {{are used}} to achieve cooling load {{forecasting}} in HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) systems. Load forecasting is crucial in plant configurations making use of thermal storage technologies, where, during the nighttime, part {{or most of the}} energy required during daytime is produced at lower cost by cooling or icing water. Load forecasting is then needed to quantify the energy to be stored for the following daytime and to set up strategies for its release during daytime. Although many algorithms have been presented in the literature for load forecasting, they often need as input a large data set, that is not always available in practical situations. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on ANNs that allows to obtain sufficiently accurate load predictions by exploiting a limited data set, obtained by measuring quantities that are typically available in standard HVAC installations. Furthermore, knowledge of the current thermal load (which is needed to setup the data set for ANN training) can be obtained by using a load estimation algorithm previously proposed by some of the authors, that only need basic knowledge of the system <b>hydronics.</b> Another distinctive feature of the algorithm is the use of the AHU schedule as a means for inferring information on the internal loads, which is in general not available in practice. Simulation results for both CAV and VAV HVAC systems confirm the viability of the approach...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaf [99]International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) {{acquired}} Bell & Gossett Company in 1963. Bell & Gossett {{was by far}} {{the leading}} company in the <b>hydronics</b> heating and cooling market (hot water/chilled water systems), with an estimated market share at that time of approximately 65 to 70 percent. Subsequently, ITT received negative media coverage in the 1960 s and 1970 s for a variety of reasons. Four brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted of Bell & Gossett's primary customers, plumbing and heating contractors, from 1968 through 1971. These studies uncovered a negative attitude towards ITT that was adversely affecting Bell & Gossett's own image with its customers. A follow-up opinion study conducted in 1980 using personal interviews clearly indicated that this negative attitude toward ITT was continuing to grow with a corresponding growth in the negativism displayed towards Bell & Gossett since it was owned by ITT. ITT then launched a public relations program with all of its major publics to offset this negative publicity that began in the late 1970 s and continued throughout the 1980 s. Follow-up brand awareness and opinion studies were conducted in 1987 with this same Bell & Gossett customer group to determine if the negative attitude towards ITT was still impacting adversely on Bell & Gossett. The 1987 study results contained little or no negative attitude toward ITT and its ownership of Bell & Gossett. This series of studies demonstrated two conclusions: 1. A conglomerate's image can adversely affect the reputation of its acquired companies. An effective public relations program can offset negative publicity and transform a negative attitude into a positive one. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E
40|$|Civil {{infrastructure}} systems, such as transportation networks, pipe networks, electrical grids, {{and building}} environments, are typically managed and controlled with outdated, inefficient, and minimally automated legacy controllers. This is apparent from documented oil pipeline leaks, broad electrical outages, and power plant failures. The relatively recent advents of small inexpensive microcontrollers and low-power wireless networking technologies has revealed opportunities for better managing the operational effectiveness of civil infrastructure systems. Academic {{research in this}} field is maturing, yet the field remains in its nascent years of commercial viability, focusing mainly on low data-rate sensing with centralized processing. Little focus has been on distributed wireless control systems for civil infrastructure. This dissertation follows the development and utilization of a new cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture for civil infrastructure. Embedded computing power is distributed throughout the physical systems and global objectives are met with the aid of wireless information exchange. The Martlet wireless controller node was conceived during {{the first part of this}} thesis to enable this objective of wirelessly distributed CPS. Once produced, the Martlet was used to realize such a controller, motivated by an application in hydronic cooling systems. The design of the proposed controller began with a study concerning models and objective functions for the control of bilinear systems, like those found in <b>hydronics,</b> when constrained by the resources of a wireless control node. The results showed that previous work with linear quadratic controllers could be improved by using nonlinear models and explicit objective functions. An agent-based controller utilizing the proposed bilinear model-predictive control algorithm, was then developed accounting for the limitation of, and leveraging the advantages of, wireless control nodes in order to regulate a hydronic system with hybrid dynamics. The resulting Martlet based control system was compared to traditional benchmark controllers and shown to achieve adequate performance, with the added benefits of a wireless CPS. These developments in wirelessly distributed control of complex systems are presented not only with the tested hydronic systems in mind, but with the goal of extending this technology to improve the performance and reliability of a wide variety of controlled cyber-physical civil infrastructure systems...|$|E
