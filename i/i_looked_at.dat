The issue is important in that without a cogent interpretation of our modal operators then our modal logic is just an academic endeavor. It would then make the task of understanding and structuralizing our natural languages much more complicated...|$|R

500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my watch and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E

[...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E

500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> what I had done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it and I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the break began, Stump was the {{heaviest}} {{he had ever been}} and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band. Coming home from tour, drummer Andy Hurley [...] "went through the darkest depression [...] ever felt. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my calendar and it was just empty." [...] Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. [...] "I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day," [...] Wentz recalled. Previously known as the [...] "overexposed, despised" [...] leader of the band, Wentz [...] "simply grew up," [...] sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: [...] "There was a jump-cut in my life. I started thinking – like, being old would be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E

Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, [...] "I had no doubt when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him that he was a Hind[...] [...] [...] The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 2012, Joe Francis, {{the creator}} of the Girls Gone Wild video franchisee, {{threatened}} to sue Madonna if she sang the song during her halftime show performance. His representatives said that [...] " [...] violated Federal and State trademark laws by making unauthorized use of Mr. Francis' trademark Girls Gone Wild in not only the title, but subject line of her various advertisements in order to lure potential consumers to purchase her latest musical effort." [...] The National Football League (NFL) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl. On hearing about the allegations, Moxey commented that Francis only wanted attention from the press, adding: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> ASCAP, I noticed there were approximately 50 records called 'Girls Gone Wild'.

500|$|As a consequence, Russell was {{extremely}} sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not. He {{was active in}} the Black Power movement and supported Muhammad Ali's decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called [...] "Felton X", presumably {{in the tradition of the}} Nation of Islam's practice of replacing a European slave name with an [...] "X", and even purchased land in Liberia. Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 Sports Illustrated interview with the words: [...] "I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black"; however, Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism: [...] "I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency." [...] However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E

500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|John Brousseau was not {{sent to the}} Hole, {{but what}} he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church.

They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [...] and DM's the only [...] one. No way." [...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore.

500|$|While {{writing the}} pilot, Rodat {{dedicated}} a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but {{decided not to}} go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. [...] "I wrote a few drafts of it and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I’ve seen this before. There’s no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.|$|E
