In this paper, a new subspace method of instability monitoring is proposed for the linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) case.

By using the lifting procedure the uncertain linear-time-periodic model of the helicopter is transformed into an augmented uncertain linear-time-invariant model that allows the application of μ-analysis tools. The lifting procedure involves a periodic switching linear-time-invariant piecewise model computed using oversampling of the system period. The representativeness of the lifted model for various oversampling period values and methods is discussed and compared with a Floquet analysis for several parametric discretization configurations. A μ-analysis is then applied to find the worst-case parametric configuration for a given rotor angular rate. The parametric uncertainties taken into account are the dynamic characteristics (stiffness and damping) of each <b>blade</b> <b>hinge.</b> A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that it enables performing ground-resonance analysis for a rotor with dissimilar blade properties due to aging effects.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes fundamental extensions to the hinge-spring {{model used}} {{to simulate the}} first mode of blade vibration in wind turbine dynamics. Complete equations of motion are developed while allowing for both bending of the blade perpendicular to its chord and overall motion of the rotor in azimuth and yaw. The model examines {{the relationship between the}} natural rotation frequency of the rotor ω and the fundamental natural bending frequency of the blades without including the bending frequency of the tower. In the case of no yaw motion, perturbation analysis and iteration lead to analytical solutions for the bending and azimuth equations of motion that involve as little simplification of these equations as possible. The natural bending frequency is “stiffened” by the rotor rotation and is expressed as a multiple of the rotor rotation, ω∗ ω. While the bending frequency is used in models using the <b>hinged</b> <b>blade,</b> the solutions found in this work contain more detail than can be found in prior investigations. These analytical solutions reveal that the harmonics with frequencies Nω∗ω (ω ∗ + 1) ω and (ω∗ − 1) ω are involved with the coupling between bending motion and azimuth motion with N = 1, 2, 3,…. Subsequent derivation of the power output for the condition of a relatively large amplitude of blade vibration predicts a noticeable contribution to power generation for the ω∗ ω response, which is verified in the data. ^ Glauret 2 ̆ 7 s momentum transfer theory as extended by Wilson and Lissaman [1974] and de Vries [1979] is modified to allow for blade bending, variations of wind speed with time and position, and variations in wind direction with time. No vertical wind is considered. It is concluded that: (1) the bending frequency and linear combinations with the rotor rotation frequency provide an important contribution under {{at least some of the}} expected operating conditions of the turbine, (2) the dynamic mass imbalance produced by the effects of blade bending is not important for an otherwise balanced rotor, and (3) modest non-symmetric effects to the dynamics such as basic wind shear or changing wind speed and direction enhance the Nω frequencies much more readily than the Nω∗ω frequencies. ...|$|R

For the rotor/body configuration analyzed, rotor cyclic inplane motion and body roll-rate and roll-acceleration feedback can considerably augment system damping levels and eliminate ground resonance instabilities. Scheduling of the feedback state, phase, and gain with rotor rotation speed can be used to maximize the damping augmentation. This increase in lead-lag damping can be accomplished without altering any of the system modal frequencies.

50|$|The semirigid rotor {{can also}} be {{referred}} to as a teetering or seesaw rotor. This system is normally composed of two blades that meet just under a common flapping or teetering hinge at the rotor shaft. This allows the blades to flap together in opposite motions like a seesaw. This underslinging of the blades below the teetering hinge, combined with an adequate dihedral or coning angle on the blades, minimizes variations in the radius of each blade's center of mass from the axis of rotation as the rotor turns, which in turn reduces the stress on the blades from lead and lag forces caused by the Coriolis effect. Secondary flapping hinges may also be provided to provide sufficient flexibility to minimize bouncing. Feathering is accomplished by the feathering <b>hinge</b> at the <b>blade</b> root, which allows changes to the pitch angle of the blade.|$|R

To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping <b>hinge</b> offset, and <b>blade</b> kinematic pitch-flap coupling over a large range of advance ratios.

5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping <b>hinge,</b> allows the <b>blade</b> to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag <b>hinge,</b> allows the <b>blade</b> to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{examination of}} flap-lag stability of a centrally <b>hinged,</b> spring-restrained rigid <b>blade</b> in both hover and forward flight is presented. Several {{differences in the}} equations of motion for blade flap-lag stability in the existing literature are identified. A rigorous and systematic development of these equations for a rigid articulated blade in forward flight shows the existence of some linear aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging in the perturbation equations. The differences identified are shown {{to be associated with}} the order in which the flap and lag transformations are taken in developing the equations of motion. The implications of these differences on stability are examined, and it is shown that the pitch-lag coupling terms associated with a flap-lag hinge transformation sequence have a marked influence on flap-lag stability. Some qualitative considerations on the role of the assumed transformation sequence in the development of the flap-lag equations for a hingeless elastic blade are also given. On the basis of these considerations, it is shown that aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging similar to those found for the rigid blade will also appear in the equations for the elastic blade...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} is described and demonstrated for CFD analysis of helicopter rotors in hover and forward flight. Starting from the Navier–Stokes equations, the paper describes the periodic rotor blade motions required {{to trim the}} rotor in forward flight (blade flapping, blade lead-lag and blade pitching) {{as well as the}} required mesh deformation. Throughout, the rotor blades are assumed to be rigid and the rotor to be fully articulated with separate <b>hinges</b> for each <b>blade.</b> The employed method allows for rotors with different numbers of blades and with various rotor hub layouts to be analysed. This method is then combined with a novel grid deformation strategy which preserves the quality of multi-block structured, body-fitted grids around the blades.

The complete {{framework is}} validated for hovering and forward flying rotors and comparisons are made against available experimental data. Finally, suggestions for further development are put forward. For all cases, results were in good agreement with experiments and rapid convergence has been obtained. Comparisons between the present grid deformation method and transfinite interpolation were made highlighting the advantages of the current approach...|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{understand}} the whirl flutter phenomenon in flapped blade rotor systems and also to shed some light in bridging the existing gap between theoretical and experimental results, the equations of motion of an idealised mathematical model of a multi-bladed rotor system were formulated. Generalised aerodynamic forces were obtained from quasi-steady blade element theory. These 13; equations were linearised and solved for a symmetric case of the system. The stability boundaries for different hinge offsets of the blades are presented as nacelle frequency parameter for neutral instability against blade flapping frequency parameter. It was found that for a particular value of the flapping frequency parameter, which {{is a function of}} <b>blade</b> <b>hinge</b> offset and restraint spring constant at the flapping hinge, the nacelle frequency parameter required for neutral instability is minimum. From these results it can be shown that an optimum flapping hinge position from the whirl flutter point of view can be determined.

Both 10 per cent and 13. 6 per cent hinge offsets resulted in backward whirl flutter as predicted by theory...|$|R
40|$|As a {{helicopter}} transitions from hover to forward flight, the main rotor blades experience an asymmetry in flow field around the azimuth, with the blade section tangential velocities increasing on the advancing side and decreasing on the retreating side. To {{compensate for the}} reduced dynamic pressure on the retreating side, the blade pitch angles over {{this part of the}} rotor disk are increased. Eventually, a high enough forward speed is attained to produce compressibility effects on the advancing side of the rotor disk and stall on the retreating side. The onset of these two phenomena drastically increases the rotor vibratory loads and power requirements, thereby effectively establishing a limit on the maximum achievable forward speed. The alleviation of compressibility and stall (and the associated decrease in vibratory loads and power) would potentially result in an increased maximum forward speed. In the past, several methods have been examined and implemented to reduce the vibratory hub loads. Some of these methods are aimed specifically at alleviating vibration at very high flight speeds and increasing the maximum flight speed, while others focus on vibration reduction within the conventional flight envelope. Among the later are several types passive as well as active schemes. Passive schemes include a variety of vibration absorbers such as mechanical springs, pendulums, and bifilar absorbers. These mechanism are easy to design and maintain, but incur significant weight and drag penalties. Among the popular active control schemes in consideration are Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) and Individual Blade Control (IBC). HHC uses a conventional swash plate to generate a multi-cyclic pitch input to the blade. This requires actuators capable of sufficiently high power and bandwidth, increasing the cost and weight of the aircraft. IBC places actuators in the rotating reference frame, requiring the use of slip rings capable of transferring enough power to the actuators. Both schemes cause an increase in pitch link loads. Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deployment can also used to generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments that counter the original vibratory loads, and thereby reduce rotor vibrations. While the vibrations absorbers, HHC, IBC, and TEF concepts discussed above attempt to reduce the vibratory loads, they do not specifically address the phenomena causing the vibrations at high advance ratios. One passive method that attempts to directly alleviate compressibility and stall, instead of reducing the ensuing vibrations, is the use of advanced tip designs. Taper, sweep, anhedral, and the manipulation of other geometric properties of the blade tips can reduce the severity of stall and compressibility effects, as well as reduce rotor power. A completely different approach to solve these problems is the tiltrotor configuration. As the forward velocity of the aircraft increases, the rotors, in this case, are tilted forward until they are perpendicular to the flow and act as propellers. This eliminates the edgewise flow encountered by conventional rotors and circumvents all the problems associated with flow asymmetry. However, the success involves a tremendous increase in cost and complexity of the aircraft. Another possible approach that has been proposed for the alleviation of vibratory loads at high forward flight speeds involves the use of controlled lead-lag motions to reduce the asymmetry in flow. A correctly phased 1 /rev controlled lag motion could be introduced such that it produces a backward velocity on the advancing side and a forward velocity on the retreating side, to delay compressibility effects and stall to a higher advance ratio. Using a large enough lead-lag amplitude, the tip velocities could be reduced to levels encountered in hover. This concept was examined by two groups in the 1950 's and early 1960 's. In the United States, the Research Labs Division of United Aircraft developed a large lead-lag motion rotor, meant to achieve lag motion amplitudes up to 45 degrees. In order to reduce the required actuation force, the <b>blade</b> <b>hinges</b> were moved to 40 % of the blade radius to increase the rotating lag frequency to approximately 1 /rev. The <b>blade</b> <b>hinges</b> were redesigned to produce a flap-lag coupling so the large flapwise aerodynamic loads could be exploited to actuate the blades in the lag direction. A wind tunnel test of this rotor concept revealed actuation and blade motion scheduling problems. The project was eventually discontinued due to these problems and high blade stresses. Around the same time, at Boelkow in Germany, a similar lead-lag rotor program was conducted under the leadership of Hans Derschmidt. Here, too, the <b>blade</b> <b>hinges</b> were moved outboard to 34 % radius to reduce the actuation loads. The main difference between this and the United Aircraft program was the use of a mechanical actuation scheme with maximum lead-lag motions of 400. This program was also discontinued for unclear reasons. The present study is directed toward conducting a comprehensive analytical examination {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} controlled lead-lag motions in reducing vibratory hub loads and increasing maximum flight speed. Since both previous studies on this subject were purely experimental, only a limited data set and physical understanding of the problem was obtained. With the currently available analytical models and computational resources, the present effort is geared toward developing an in-depth physical understanding of the precise underlying mechanisms by which vibration reduction may be achieved. Additionally, in recognition of the fact that large amplitude lead-lag motions would - (i) be difficult to implement, and (ii) produce very large blade stresses; the present study examines the potential of only moderate-to-small lead-lag motions for reduction of vibratory hub loads. Using such an approach, the emphasis is not on eliminating the periodic variations in tangential velocity at the blade tip, but at best reducing these variations slightly so that compressibility and stall are delayed to slightly higher advance ratios. This study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, a hingeless helicopter rotor was modeled using rigid blades undergoing flap-lag-torsion rotations about spring restrained hinges and bearings. This model was then modified by separating the lead-lag degree of freedom into two components, a free and a prescribed motion. Using this model, a parametric study of the effect of phase and amplitude of a prescribed lead-lag motion on hub vibration was conducted. The data gathered was analyzed to obtain an understanding of the basic physics of the problem and show the capability of this method to reduce vibration and expand the flight envelope. In the second half of the study, the similar analysis was conducted using an elastic blade model to confirm the effects predicted by the simpler model...|$|R
