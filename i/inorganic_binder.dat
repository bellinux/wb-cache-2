50|$|The {{result is}} a highly durable {{connection}} between paint coat and substrate. Above that the binding agent water glass is highly resistant against UV light. While organic binders such as dispersions based on acrylate or silicone resin under UV over the years tend to grow brittle, chalky and develop cracks which finally result in damage to paint coats, the <b>inorganic</b> <b>binder</b> water glass remains stable. The chemical fusion with the substrate and the UV stability of the binder are the fundamental reasons for the extraordinarily high lifetime of silicate paints.|$|E
50|$|Powder cores {{consist of}} metal grains {{mixed with a}} {{suitable}} organic or <b>inorganic</b> <b>binder,</b> and pressed to desired density. Higher density is achieved with higher pressure and lower amount of binder. Higher density cores have higher permeability, but lower resistance and therefore higher losses due to eddy currents. Finer particles allow operation at higher frequencies, as the eddy currents are mostly restricted to within the individual grains. Coating of the particles with an insulating layer, or their separation with {{a thin layer of}} a binder, lowers the eddy current losses. Presence of larger particles can degrade high-frequency performance. Permeability is influenced by the spacing between the grains, which form distributed air gap; the less gap, the higher permeability and the less-soft saturation. Due to large difference of densities, even a small amount of binder, weight-wise, can significantly increase the volume and therefore intergrain spacing.|$|E

The effects of zeolite structure and size and choice of binder on the deodorization rate have been studied.

40|$|A new <b>inorganic</b> <b>binder</b> {{system has}} been {{developed}} to prepare the mold having a high strength for the thin-walled casting. To increase the fracture strength at high temperature, {{a large amount of}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>binder</b> should be converted into glass phase and the generated glass phase has to be homogeneously coated on the surface of starting particles. In this work, two types of process were employed to investigate the coating and glassification efficiencies of inorganic precursor.

In the second process (process II), the starting powder was coated by inorganic precursor, and then the organic binder was used to form the green body. The mold sample prepared using process II showed the higher strength value than that using process I, owing to the inclement effect on the glassfication efficiency by the loss of inorganic precursor in process I.

After evaluating the green body mechanical properties, the samples were densified at different sintering temperature from 1200 to 1450 °C with definite intervals of 50 °C and subjected to flexural strength analysis. Variation in flexural strength with sintering temperature was observed and correlated with the quantity of devitrification of fused silica during sintering. Quantification of devitrified cristobalite was carried out by using 20 wt% rutile (TiO 2) as an internal standard by X-ray diffraction. It was found that, as the cristobalite content increased, flexural strength decreased. Reliability studies were carried out for the samples having maximum flexural strength with and without crystalline content.

Methods: The three copper-based formulations were tested: (i) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Legionella pneumophila, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/ baumannii (ACCB), glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus and spores of Clostridium difficile in time– kill assays; (ii) {{for their ability}} to decontaminate ultramicrofibre (UMF) cloths; and (iii) for their cytotox-icity to human skin and intestinal epithelial cells. Results: All three copper-based formulations were potently biocidal down to concentrations of 1 ppm for both stationary- and log-phase organisms, and they were all active against C. difficile spores.
