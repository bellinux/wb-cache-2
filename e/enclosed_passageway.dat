25|$|This {{station has}} an {{elevated}} station house beneath the tracks {{at the extreme}} south end. A single staircase from each platform goes down to a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Near these staircases, one elevator leads from each platform to the mezzanine. Outside fare control, there is a token booth; an elevator and two staircases {{go down to the}} northwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, while two escalators within an <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> lead directly to the complex's underground mezzanine area (via a new transfer passageway), and the northbound platform's elevator (within fare control) also leads to the underground mezzanine, bypassing the street along the way. A single staircase also leads to the southwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, and is signposted as serving only the Flushing Line station (as opposed to all three stations of the complex).|$|E
500|$|On April 28, 2011, {{the station}} was closed and {{underwent}} a $15 million renovation. This renovation {{was sponsored by the}} Resorts World Casino (or [...] "Racino"), which had opened at the racetrack in 2011 and wanted to create a direct connection from the station to the casino. The station was scheduled to reopen in early 2012, but was delayed. The renovation added new staircases to street level, an <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> between the station and casino, and an elevator from the street to platform level to make the station ADA-accessible. The station reopened on August 13, 2013, and now operates 24 hours a day. In 2013, there was a proposal to rename this station to Aqueduct–Resorts World Casino and to add a platform for Rockaway-bound trains. As of July 2012, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has withheld approvals to construct a southbound platform.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, Reagan {{delivered}} a luncheon address to AFL–CIO representatives at the Washington Hilton Hotel. The hotel {{was considered the}} safest venue in Washington because of its secure, <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> called [...] "President's Walk", which was built after the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Reagan entered the building through the passageway around 1:45p.m., waving to a crowd of news media and citizens. The Secret Service had required him to wear a bulletproof vest for some events, but Reagan was not wearing one for the speech, because his only public exposure would be the 30 feet (9 m) between the hotel and his limousine, and the agency did not require vests for its agents that day. No one saw Hinckley behaving in an unusual way; witnesses who reported him as [...] "fidgety" [...] and [...] "agitated" [...] apparently confused Hinckley with another person that the Secret Service had been monitoring.|$|E
5000|$|Until 2011, {{an extra}} out-of-system subway-to-subway {{transfer}} was allowed between 23rd Street-Ely Avenue/Long Island City-Court Square ( [...] trains) and 45th Road-Court House Square (...) [...] An <b>enclosed</b> transfer <b>passageway</b> was opened {{between the three}} stations in 2011, rendering this transfer unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|The side {{extensions}} are accessed via partially <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageways</b> {{at the back}} of the building. Between the wards and these passageways are lean-to additions with skillion roofs that each contain a further two rooms. At the western end of the building there is also a timber toilet block with terrazzo floors attached at the northern side of the passageway. The western extension contains four equal sized rooms, with three-quarter height, fibrous-cement partitions and lino floors, the eastern extension is divided into five small rooms. The perimeter walls have multi-paned, coloured glass sliding windows and timber sills with tongue and groove lining below. Many of the rooms are furnished with cast iron beds from the sanatorium. Original doors are located in the wall between the former ward and the eastern extension.|$|R
50|$|The {{articulated}} unit, 80 ft long, 10 ft {{wide and}} 12 ft high, {{consisted of three}} compartments placed on four trucks, connected by fully <b>enclosed,</b> hinged <b>passageways.</b> The Bluebird {{was an example of}} Art Deco industrial design, presenting a clean and mildly streamlined appearance. The Bluebird was designed during the Great Depression as a fast, physically attractive and comfortable mass transit vehicle that would attract passengers, while instituting significant economies in production, operation, and maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station has}} one {{elevated}} station {{house at the}} center of the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from each side go down to a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides access to and from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and an <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> on the west side leading to two escalators going down to the west side of Broadway, diverging in opposite directions. One escalator leads to 125th Street while the other leads to Tiemann Place. On the east side of the station house, another <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> leads to an escalator facing south and going down to the southeast corner of Broadway and 125th Street. Adjacent to this passageway is an [...] "L" [...] shaped staircase with its upper half directly above Broadway and the lower half beneath the enclosed escalator going to the same corner of the intersection.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} Platform 2 is the {{entrance}} to the Worm, an <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> which leads under Avenue Road into the former Imperial Hotel (now Malvern St James). It formed a private pedestrian access and {{is believed to be the}} only structure of its kind in the country. Although in need of extensive restoration and generally not open to the public, the Worm is itself Grade II listed.|$|E
50|$|The Vasari Corridor (Corridoio Vasariano) is an {{elevated}} <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning {{on the south}} side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. At the time of construction, the corridor had to be built around the Torre dei Mannelli, using brackets, because the owners of the tower refused to alter it. The corridor covers up part of the façade of the Church of Santa Felicita. The corridor then snakes its way over rows of houses in the Oltrarno district, becoming narrower, to finally join the Palazzo Pitti. Most of it is closed to visitors.|$|E
5000|$|Posvar Hall was {{designed}} by a consortium of architects, including Louis Valentour of Johnstone Newcomer & Valentour, who worked under the watch of Max Abramowitz who acted {{as a consultant to}} the university for the project. [...] Construction began in 1975 and was completed in 1978 with the dedication occurring on October 19, 1978. The building sits on the former site of Forbes Field baseball stadium and beside the university's Hillman Library on the corner of Schenley Drive and Roberto Clemente Drive with Bouquet Street running along its west side. <b>Enclosed</b> <b>passageways</b> connect Posvar Hall to David Lawrence Hall, the Barco Law Building, and the Litchfield Towers. Posvar Hall {{was designed}} in the Brutalist style and is constructed with concrete with a limestone exterior and its height was limited to five stories so it would not compete with The Carnegie Institute directly across Schenley Plaza. Construction costs exceeded $38 million ($ million today). Its floor space slightly exceeds that of the Cathedral of Learning. It has 2,000 windows, 574 offices, 30 seminar rooms, three lecture halls, one mile of corridors, and nearly 500 parking spaces in its two level garage below the facility.|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, {{the most}} persuasive theory for {{the origin of}} the floor plan is that it is based on {{descriptions}} of the Temple of Solomon by the Judeo-Roman historian, Flavius Josephus: a portico followed by a courtyard open to the sky, followed by a second portico and a second courtyard, all flanked by arcades and <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageways,</b> leading to the [...] "holy of holies". Statues of David and Solomon {{on either side of the}} entrance to the basilica of El Escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design. A more personal connection can be drawn between the David-warrior figure, representing Charles V, and his son, the stolid and solomonically prudent Philip II. Echoing the same theme, a fresco in the center of El Escorial's library, a reminder of Solomon’s legendary wisdom, affirms Philip's preoccupation with the great Jewish king, his thoughtful and logical character, and his extraordinary monumental temple.The Temple-of-Solomon design, if indeed it was the basis for El Escorial, was extensively modified to accommodate the additional functions and purposes Philip II intended the building to serve. Beyond being a monastery, El Escorial is also a pantheon, a basilica, a convent, a school, a library, and a royal palace. All these functional demands resulted in a doubling of the building's size from the time of its original conception.|$|R
50|$|A {{concrete}} edged, curved {{garden bed}} with a small cannon positioned centrally is located against the southern wall of the building, and decorative timber gates <b>enclose</b> the <b>passageway</b> between the office building and No. 2 shed to the east. A timber wharf extends from the southern elevation of the office building, and extends along the southern frontage of No. 2 shed with timber post and rail balustrade chain balustrade. This wharf has non-slip compressed sheeting fixed to the upper decking in traffic areas. A section of the wharf {{in front of the}} office building is recessed, with stairs down to a lower deck for smaller craft to berth.|$|R
50|$|The Vasari Corridor {{was built}} in 5 months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, {{to the design of}} Giorgio Vasari. It was {{commissioned}} in connection with the marriage of Cosimo's son, Francesco, with Johanna of Austria. The idea of an <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> was motivated by the Grand Duke's desire to move freely between his residence and the government palace, when, like most monarchs of the period, he felt insecure in public, in his case especially because he had replaced the Republic of Florence. The meat market of Ponte Vecchio was moved to avoid its smell reaching into the passage, its place being taken by the goldsmith shops that still occupy the bridge. At the latter extremity, the corridor was forced to pass around the Mannelli's Tower, after the staunch opposition of that family to its destruction.|$|E

30|$|To improve mine {{air quality}} and dust {{collection}} performance, an <b>enclosed</b> cyclone <b>passageway</b> (ECP) dust-collecting fan {{has been designed}} and developed. This is a novel dust-collecting fan, which separates dust by the centrifugal force exerted by a driven spiral airflow. Its dust removal mechanism is thus {{different from those of}} existing dust collectors. In this study, a general equation for dust removal in the centrifugal dust removal section (CDRS) of ECP fan is deduced by applying the classic force equilibrium principle, which states that the centrifugal force on a dust particle should be equal to the aerodynamic resistance of the corresponding spiral airflow at a given spatial point. The equation is then simplified, and case studies are conducted for the ECP fan using the simplest form of the equation. Finally, the effects of structural and operating parameters on centrifugal dust removal in the CDRS are analysed through an engineering case study.|$|R
30|$|An <b>enclosed</b> cyclone <b>passageway</b> (ECP) dust-collecting fan is discussed. The ECP fan {{separates}} dust by {{centrifugal force}} originating from a driven spiral airflow, and its design takes {{the constraints of}} Chinese underground coal mines into consideration. Using the force equilibrium law, a general equation for dust removal in the centrifugal dust removal section (CDRS) of the ECP fan is deduced. This general equation is simplified using the CDRS structure and the fan operating parameters and is analysed numerically. The attractive results show that increases in the airflow rate of the fan, the structural ratio of the ECPs and the radius of the extended axis can improve the dust removal performance of the CDRS. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} structural ratio and the radius on dust removal dominate over that of the flow rate, and the effect of the structural ratio is more significant than that of the radius.|$|R
50|$|Pedestrian {{walkways}} {{have become}} important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been {{features of the}} downtown cores of Toronto (PATH (Toronto)) and Montreal (Underground City, Montreal) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the Plus 15 system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16 km of <b>enclosed</b> climate controlled <b>passageways</b> suspended 15 ft above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside.|$|R
5000|$|... 1933. Following the {{elevation}} of the diocese into an archdiocese and the consecration of the new archbishop Msgr. Gabriel Reyes (1932-1950), the cathedral undergoes renovation. The project is supervised by Chinese Cebuano engineer Gavino Unchuan based on plans made by Cebu and Manila architects Eulogio Tablante Jr., Felino C.T. Lepon and Julio Ancheta. During the renovation, the retablo of the 1860s is torn down and replaced with a simple altar made of Carrara marble imported from Italy. Above the marble altar are placed three stained glass windows portraying the archangels Michael and Gabriel with the Lord in the center. The façade is extended to the camarin delos campaneros or the <b>enclosed</b> <b>passageway</b> to the belfry {{which used to be}} the bell-ringer’s quarters, thus making the church look even bigger. The entire church is also plastered with cement covering the walls which are painted later.|$|E

40|$|In Capriolo's fiction we see, above all, the {{centrality}} {{of place in the}} minds and lives of her protagonists, often linked with the idea of the labyrinth: labyrinth as endless tortuous <b>passageways,</b> <b>enclosed</b> place, puzzle, quest. The stories, built around the obsessions of their protagonists, transcend normal temporal and spatial boundaries, and reflect the labyrinth in various forms: as a physical maze; as mirror reflections, sometimes infinitely receding; as a remote, closed-off place; and as a metaphor suggesting confusion of the mind or of ideas. As well as a considerable degree of overlap within these areas, there is a pervading, underlying sense of ambiguity, and the idea of permanence and of eternal 'being'...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} {{with the development of}} the Rideau Centre across the street, the City of Ottawa agreed in 1981 to close Freiman Street and to lease the land to the HBC for a term of 99 years in exchange for the construction of an <b>enclosed,</b> public pedestrian <b>passageway</b> connecting Rideau Street to George Street and the ByWard Market, to be open 24 hours per day. Under the terms of the lease, HBC was entitled to install three kiosks related to its store within the new Freiman Mall. The company and the city would share operating and security costs, with the City's share based on the proportion of public (non-retail) floor area and the amount of time the mall would be open past the store's operating hours.|$|R
