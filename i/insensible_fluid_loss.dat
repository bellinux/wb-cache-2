40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{respiratory}} infection {{is a common}} reason for people to present for medical care. Advice to increase fluid intake is a frequent treatment recommendation. Attributed benefits of fluids include replacing increased <b>insensible</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>losses,</b> correcting dehydration from reduced intake and reducing the viscosity of mucus. However, there are theoretical reasons for increased fluid intake to cause harm. Anti-diuretic hormone secretion is increased in lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies. This systematic examination of the evidence sought to determine the benefit versus harm from increasing fluid intake. OBJECTIVES: To answer the following questions. (1) Does recommending increased fluid intake {{as a treatment for}} acute {{respiratory infection}}s improve duration and severity of symptoms? (2) Are there adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in people with acute respiratory infections? (3) Are any benefits or harms related to site of infection (upper or lower respiratory tract) or a different severity of illness? SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 1, 2005), EMBASE (1974 to Week 29, 2005), Current Contents (current 5 years) and CINAHL (1982 to July week 3 2005).

30|$|Filtration rate {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of drilling fluids. High rates of filtration increase the mud thickness, which lead to operational problems such as stuck pipe (Nasiri et al. 2018). After hot rolling of drilling fluids for 16  h, API filtration test was conducted. According to Fig.  6, the amount of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> of the base mud is equal to 2.7 ccs at 325  °F.

40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>loss</b> into {{formation}} {{is due to}} greater hydrostatic pressure exerted on the formation. This phenomenon may give severe drilling problems such as stuck pipe, formation damage and poor cementing job. Thus, the use of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control agent could reduce the tendency of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> into formation. Currently, polyanionic cellulose (PAC) {{is one of the}} <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control agents that are widely used to control <b>fluid</b> <b>loss.</b> Since the PAC has to be imported at a high price, thus {{there is a need to}} look for cheaper local materials to substitute PAC. This paper discusses the prospect of utilizing local starches, namely sago and tapioca, as <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control agents in water-based mud. This discussion is based on the results derived from laboratory experiments. In this study, the performance of sago and tapioca starches were compared to PAC. Experimental results revealed that sago and tapioca starches could achieve the viscosity produced by PAC. For a given mud viscosity, it was found that sago mud could give comparable gel strength and yield point as compared to PAC mud. The significant advantage of utilizing sago mud was it could produce a thinner mud cake than PAC mud. Surprisingly, both samples were found to give comparable values of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss.</b> Based on this preliminary study, it could be concluded that local starches especially sago has the potential to be used as <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control agent in drilling mud. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{should also}} be {{emphasized}} that above 375  °F, the amount of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> is increased and reached to 48  ml.

30|$|Another key {{challenge}} involves attaining predictable {{properties for}} nanoparticle modified drilling mud. For example, the known rheological models {{used in the}} characterization of bentonite-based muds allow for a parameterized computation of fluid rheology (Vryzas and Kelessidis 2017). In other words, such models cannot quantitatively capture the contributions of nanoparticles to the overall fluid rheology of the modified bentonite mud. In such approach, shear stress and viscosity are expressed as a data-driven correlation or explicit function of shear rate. The work of Reilly et al. (2016) and Gerogiorgis et al. (2017) laid a good foundation for rheological models for nano-drilling fluids, Furthermore, extending the work to cover other aspects of drilling mud performance such as <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> behavior is important. There is currently no known model which describes the <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> behavior of nano-drilling muds. The development of models for describing the fluid behavior of nanoparticle-enhanced drilling fluids is critical towards successful modelling, design and cost-effective drilling operations. The well-known API <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> model is simply a function of time and parametrized approach is taken when describing the <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> of nanoparticle-enhanced drilling fluids. The contributory effect of nanoparticles in the <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> reduction is not captured in the model.|$|R
