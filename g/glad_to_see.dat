5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum {{of money}} from his distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E
25|$|However, not {{all members}} of the royal family were {{dissatisfied}} with Peter's mesalliance and subsequent loss of dynastic rights. His aunt, Princess Andrew, was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him excluded from the line of succession because it brought her own son, Prince Philip (later Duke of Edinburgh), closer to the throne.|$|E

Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|During occupation, ethnic {{tensions}} were raised and nationalism grew. The Malayans were thus {{on the whole}} <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the British back in 1945, but things could not remain as they were before the war, and a stronger desire for independence grew. Britain was bankrupt and the new Labour government was keen to withdraw its forces from the East as soon as possible. Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.|$|E
