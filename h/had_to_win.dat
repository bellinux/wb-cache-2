5|$|MLS clubs {{were first}} {{included}} in the U.S. Open Cup tournament in 1996. D.C. United won the tournament that year, and repeated their success in 2008. In 2009, the club began its title defense in the MLS qualification rounds. This meant that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> six games instead of the four needed to obtain the cup in 2008.|$|E

5|$|As the {{defending}} champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the Kremlin Cup, {{knowing that she}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at WTA Finals {{for the first time}} since 2009 and also meant that Kuznetsova managed to successfully defend a title for the first time in her career.|$|E

5|$|The {{opposition}} in the semi-finals were Scottish champions Dundee United. The first leg was held at Dundee United's home ground, Tannadice Park. Dundee United won the match 2–0, meaning that Roma <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by three clear goals to progress to the final. Roma did indeed score three goals to win the tie 3–0 and progress to the final, by virtue of a 3–2 aggregate victory. In 1986, Roma president Dino Viola was banned by UEFA for attempting to bribe referee Michel Vautrot with £50,000 before the match.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn {{a majority of the}} vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E

5|$|Mismanagement {{over the}} next few years led to Hibs {{becoming}} homeless and the club temporarily ceased operating in 1891. A lease on the Easter Road site was acquired in late 1892 and Hibs played its first match at Easter Road on 4 February 1893. Despite this interruption, the club today views the period since 1875 as one continued history and therefore counts the honours won between 1875 and 1891, including the 1887 Scottish Cup. The club were admitted to the Scottish Football League in 1893, although they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Second Division twice before being elected into the First Division in 1895.|$|E
5|$|On the June 21 {{episode of}} Raw, a number one contender's match between Eugene and Triple H was {{scheduled}} {{in which the}} winner would face Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight Championship. The match, however, ended in a No Contest. On the June 28 episode of Raw, a rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship between Benoit and Kane took place. A stipulation was placed that Benoit <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the match by submission, while Kane could win by pinfall, submission, disqualification or countout. Benoit won the match, after he made Kane submit to a crossface. At Vengeance, Benoit defeated Triple H to retain his Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, the [...] "Final Four" [...] format {{used in the}} University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) {{was first}} applied: in a {{modified}} Shaughnessy playoff system, the two teams with the best records possess the [...] "twice to beat advantage" [...] in which they only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> once <b>to</b> advance to the best-of-three finals while their opponents <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> twice.

5|$|The pennant race {{continued}} {{between the}} three teams throughout the entire season. On September 25, after playing 147 games, with seven games left to play, all three teams had a record of 91–56. After each team played four more games, the Indians were up two games, meaning the Yankees and Red Sox <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> their games on September 30 {{to stay in the}} pennant race. They did, and the month of October opened up with both teams 1.5 games behind the Indians. The Indians' last series was a three-game stand against the Tigers, while the Red Sox and Yankees had a two-game series against each other.|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the match in order {{to be part of the}} group. After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he was out of the group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{failed to}} qualify for Euro 96, despite a strong start to the group, when they won their opening three games, {{including}} a 4–0 win against Northern Ireland. The Republic's next game was also against Northern Ireland, although {{the result was a}} 1–1 draw. From that point onwards the Republic stuttered badly as injuries struck down key players such as Roy Keane, Andy Townsend, John Sheridan and Steve Staunton. After beating the highly fancied Portugal, the Irish then endured an embarrassing 0–0 draw to Liechtenstein (this was Liechtenstein's only point in their ten matches), before losing twice to Austria, on both occasions by three goals to one. Although they defeated Latvia, Ireland needed to beat Portugal in Lisbon to qualify outright, but lost 3–0. They finished second in the group, ahead of Northern Ireland on goal difference, but as the worst performing runners-up they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a play-off game at Anfield against the Netherlands; Ireland lost 2–0 after a brace from Patrick Kluivert. Charlton resigned shortly after the game.|$|E
50|$|The Final Four {{in which}} the four teams (out of eight) with the best records qualify for the postseason playoff games was instituted in Season 56 (1993 - 94). Previously the postseason was a {{championship}} series between the top two teams, with the #1 seeded team holding the twice to beat advantage, i.e., they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> only once <b>to</b> clinch the championship. The #2 team <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> twice.|$|R

5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only responding {{in the second half}} with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica {{at the top of the}} table for the first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, he said it was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica closed their European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E
5|$|After another winter {{coaching}} in India and practising his bowling, Kilner took 145 first-class wickets at 13.28 during the 1924 English summer, placing him {{second in the}} national averages behind his teammate George Macaulay. His batting suffered a decline; he scored 731 runs at 20.88, the lowest aggregate of his career and his first sub-1,000 total since 1912. Kilner took 33 wickets {{in the first six}} matches of the season, and his form earned selection for a Test trial match. In this game, he took three for 49 in the first innings and a further wicket in the second but only scored 20 runs in two innings. After 19 wickets in his next three matches, including seven in the match against the South African touring side, he was awarded a place in the England team for the first Test. In his maiden Test, he scored 59 out of a large total, batting at number seven. South Africa were dismissed for 30 runs in the first innings before Kilner had an opportunity to bowl. In the second innings, he delivered 22 overs without taking a wicket and commentators were not impressed by his bowling. The selectors left Kilner out of the next two Tests, all-rounder J. W. Hearne taking his place, but he played in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. He scored a rapid 113—his only century of the season—for the Players. By lunch on the last day, the Gentlemen had followed-on but were well placed to secure a draw with the score at 112 for three. Kilner settled the match by taking quick wickets and ending the innings with figures of six for 20 as the Players won by an innings. Kilner was recalled for Hearne in the fourth Test, but rain prevented all play after the first day. He bowled 12 wicketless overs, meaning he had not dismissed anyone in his first two Tests and he did not play in the last Test as Hearne returned. For Yorkshire, he had a more successful time, three times taking ten wickets in a match, including twelve for 55 in the final championship match of the season, which Yorkshire <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> to have a chance of winning the title. Yorkshire's opponents, Sussex, were bowled out twice for less than 100, and when other results went Yorkshire's way, the club were crowned champions for the third successive year. Kilner was chosen for the Players again in an end of season match at Scarborough.|$|E
