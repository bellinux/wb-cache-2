500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other kids, playing better baseball than they were.

She was on set for two days, playing the sister of Monte Blue. Dwan later commented, [...] "She ate it up".|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on.

They shot the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Germans, and got the hell shot out of them." [...] As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced, often by tanks. Scattered {{along the length of the}} beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.|$|E

Mark Perigard of The Boston Herald wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. It's long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story." [...] Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly {{was so impressed with}} the scene that she was initially concerned it may be a dream sequence, [...] "because we don't get romantic, unapologetic first kisses like that between young gay characters on network TV." [...] She wrote, [...] "Relationships aren't easy. They’ll make mistakes. But if they stay true to themselves, and continue to be as open and honest with each other, we're in for something special."

[...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment".

One of those watching the boat being lowered, Dr. Washington Dodge, felt [...] "overwhelmed with doubts" [...] that he might be subjecting his wife and son to greater danger aboard the boat than if they had remained on Titanic. Ismay sought to spur those lowering the boat to greater urgency by calling out repeatedly: [...] "Lower away!"

2500|$|A {{theological}} {{argument over}} the Harrowing of Hell led to several attacks on Bilson personally {{in what is}} now called the Descensus controversy. Bilson's literal views on the descent of Christ into Hell were orthodox for [...] "conformist" [...] Anglicans of the time, while the Puritan wing of the church preferred a metaphorical or spiritual reading. He maintained that Christ went to hell, not to suffer, but to wrest the keys of <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devil’s hands. For this doctrine he was severely handled by Henry Jacob and also by other Puritans. Hugh Broughton, a noted Hebraist, was excluded from the translators of the King James Bible, and became a vehement early critic. The origin of Broughton's published attack on Bilson as a scholar and theologian, from 1604, is thought to lie in a sermon Bilson gave in 1597, which Broughton, at first and wrongly, thought supported his own view that hell and paradise coincided in place. From another direction the Roman Catholic controversialist Richard Broughton also attacked Anglican conformists through Bilson's views, writing in 1607. Much feeling was excited by the controversy, and Queen Elizabeth, in her ire, commanded Bilson, [...] "neither to desert the doctrine, nor let the calling which he bore in the Church of God, be trampled under foot, by such unquiet refusers of truth and authority." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yet {{with all}} these excrescences and defects, the {{unbounded}} popularity of the Robbers {{is not difficult to}} account for. To every reader, the excitement of emotion must be a chief consideration; to the mass of readers it is the sole one: and the grand secret of moving others is, that the poet be himself moved. We have seen how well Schiller's temper and circumstances qualified him to fulfil this condition: treatment, not of his choosing, had raised his own mind into something like a Pythian frenzy; and his genius, untrained as it was, sufficed to communicate abundance of the feeling to others. Perhaps more than abundance: to judge from our individual impression, the perusal of the Robbers produces an effect powerful even to pain; we are absolutely wounded by the catastrophe; our minds are darkened and distressed, as if we had witnessed the execution of a criminal. It is in vain that we rebel against the inconsistencies and crudities of the work: its faults are redeemed by the living energy that pervades it. We may exclaim against the blind madness of the hero; but there is a towering grandeur about him, a whirlwind force of passion and of will, which catches our hearts, and puts the scruples of criticism to silence. The most delirious of enterprises is that of Moor, but the vastness of his mind renders even that interesting. We see him leagued with desperadoes directing their savage strength to actions more and more audacious; he is in arms against the conventions of men and the everlasting laws of Fate: yet we follow him with anxiety through the forests and desert places, where he wanders, encompassed with peril, inspired with lofty daring, and torn by unceasing remorse; and we wait with awe for the doom which he has merited and cannot avoid. Nor amid all his frightful aberrations do we ever cease to love him: he is an 'archangel though in ruins;' and the strong agony with which he feels the present, the certainty of that stern future which awaits him, which his own eye never loses sight of, makes us lenient to his crimes. When he pours forth his wild recollections, or still wilder forebodings, there is a terrible vehemence in his expressions, which overpowers us, in spite both of his and their extravagance. The scene on the hills beside the Danube, where he looks at the setting sun, and thinks of old hopes, and times 'when he could not sleep if his evening prayer had been forgotten,' is one, with all its improprieties, that ever clings to the memory. [...] "See," [...] he passionately continues, [...] "all things are gone forth to bask in the peaceful beam of the spring: why must I alone inhale the torments of <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joys of heaven? That all should be so happy, all so married together by the spirit of peace! The whole world one family, its Father above; that Father not mine! I alone the castaway, I alone struck out from the company of the just; not for me the sweet name of child, never for me the languishing look of one whom I love; never, never, the embracing of a bosom friend! Encircled with murderers; serpents hissing around me; riveted to vice with iron bonds; leaning on the bending reed of vice over the gulf of perdition; amid the flowers of the glad world, a howling Abaddon! Oh, that I might return into my mother's womb;—that I might be born a beggar! I would never more—O Heaven, that I could be as one of these day-labourers! Oh, I would toil till the blood ran down from my temples, to buy myself the pleasure of one noontide sleep, the blessing of a single tear. There was a time too, when I could weep—O ye days of peace, thou castle of my father, ye green lovely valleys!—O all ye Elysian scenes of my childhood! will ye never come again, never with your balmy sighing cool my burning bosom? Mourn with me, Nature! They will never come again, never cool my burning bosom with their balmy sighing. They are gone! gone! and may not return!" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{geologic}} history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> Hells Canyon began 300 {{million years}} ago with an arc of volcanoes that emerged from <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean.

I can’t say too much about him as don’t want to spoil the surprise but I guarantee he will scare <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you!"Throughout <b>the</b> tour, the stage was decorated in a futuristic manner befitting The Final Frontier. Two large antennae adorned the back corners, both topped by lights. The long-used wraparound set, surrounding the band and providing a runway for Bruce Dickinson complete with two podiums, was decorated {{to look like a}} space ship with the monitors painted to match and featuring the new [...] "Cross-keys" [...] symbol. [...] "S-15" [...] appeared multiple times on the set, a reference to [...] "Satellite 15... The Final Frontier", along with a succession of dots and lines at the back, spelling out [...] "Eddie Lives" [...] in morse code. The entrances to the stage were covered by two curtains painted as doors, and the stage floor was decorated to look like <b>the</b> rocky surface <b>of</b> a planet (changed to a metallic pattern in 2011). As with previous tours, Nicko McBrain's drumkit featured a Sooty puppet, this time dressed in a spacesuit.|$|R
