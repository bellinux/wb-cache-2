2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "he shall write {{a copy of}} this law in a book" [...] in [...] to teach that when he went to war, he was to take it with him; on returning, he was to bring it back; when he sat in judgment, it was to be with him; and when he sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> it was to be before him, to fulfill the words of [...] "and it shall be with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consideration {{for animals}} is an {{important}} part of Judaism. It is part of the Noachide code. Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work. All animals must be kept in adequate conditions. Sports like bullfighting are forbidden. Animals may be eaten as long as they are killed using [...] shechitah, a method where the animal has its throat cut using a specially sharpened knife. Jewish butchers are trained in this method which must meet the requirements of kashrut.|$|E
2500|$|The block kitchen (or island) is a {{more recent}} development, {{typically}} found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing [...] "island", separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or {{the rest of the}} family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> breakfast and snacks.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Taizong died in 649 and was {{succeeded by}} his son and crown prince Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). [...] Around the new year 667, Emperor Gaozong {{commissioned}} the chancellor Li Ji to command a major attack on Goguryeo, and Hao Chujun was made an assistant to Li Ji, a campaign during which Hao served with distinction. [...] In one particular incident, Hao, who {{was said to be}} obese, was approachinging a Goguryeo city when Goguryeo forces launched a surprise counterattack, causing much alarm for Hao's soldiers. [...] Hao, who was said to be obese, did not panick, and instead pulled out a chair and sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his rations, while secretly ordering his elite troops to attack Goguryeo forces, defeating them. [...] His calmness impressed his troops.|$|E
2500|$|Trent Bridge (1/123), but {{fought back}} in the second innings (4/53) with the wickets of Roy Fredericks, Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd and Bernard Julien. With England wanting a draw Snow slowed down the game by {{stuffing}} bread-crumbs in his pocket during lunch and scattering them over the wicket. Umpire Dickie Bird had to use his cap to scare away the pigeons that kept flying <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them. In the end the veterans John Edrich and Brian Close grimly held out for a draw amongst fast, short-pitched bowling. Snow struck again at Lord's with 4/68 as he and Underwood (5/39) shot the tourists out for 182, but asked to make 332 to win they held out for 241/6. Snow was dropped for the Third Test at Old Trafford, [...] which England lost by 425 runs, but was recalled for his final Test at Headingley. Here he reduced the West Indians from 413–5 to 450 all out with 4/77, including his 200th Test wicket, Andy Roberts, but took only 2/82 in the second and England lost by 55 runs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph's {{brothers}} stripped {{him of his}} coat of many colors and cast him into an empty pit. They sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and when they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites from Gilead bringing spices and balm to Egypt, Judah persuaded the brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites. Passing Midianite merchants drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, and they brought him to Egypt. When Reuben returned to the pit and Joseph was gone, he rent his clothes and asked his brothers where he could go now. They took Joseph's coat of many colors, dipped it in goat's blood, {{and sent it to}} Jacob to identify. Jacob concluded that a beast had devoured Joseph, and rent his garments, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son. All his sons and daughters tried in vain to comfort him. And the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's captain of the guard. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{differences}} were perceived by Mazakmat who returned home and promulgated the religion despite {{resistance from the}} Catholic and Methodist missions. He met up with an old friend, Michael Homerang, who was a highly respected malanggan carver and clan leader (maimai) {{in the village of}} Madina, on the north shore of New Ireland Province in the far north east. Momerang later said [...] "I saw a white man and woman come to my village and sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and talk with us. They even slept in our houses. … Only the Almight can make this happen…" [...] Then they met with clan leaders and elders of the community and early in 1958 there were a further 10 conversions who elected the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Papua New Guinea, followed by 30-40 more converts {{over the next four years}} in two villages. 1958 is considered the founding year of the Bahá'í community in Papua New Guinea. Representatives from Papua and New Guinea each (the country was then administered separately) [...] attended the 1958 conference in Australia on the promulgation of the religion.|$|E
2500|$|In the introduction, {{the poet}} {{establishes}} the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional {{framework of a}} dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits “all solytary alone besyde a lake,/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde” (1). [...] But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. [...] Morpheus comes and escorts him {{to the court of}} Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. [...] There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. [...] Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. [...] In Apollo’s palace, Diana’s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as they sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> [...] The gods won’t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. [...] Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. [...] He threatens to leave their employ if they don’t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. [...] All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. [...] They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender {{will not be able to}} escape in the sea or air and then ask who it is that has defied them. [...] When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well and the only thing that can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto’s bastard son. [...] Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. [...] Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. [...] The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.|$|E

60|$|Kurt {{reached for}} the rope of the farm-bell, and rang it rather sharply. Then he went in {{to take his place}} at the table, and Jerry soon followed. Old man Dorn did not appear, which fact was not unusual. The other hired men did not enter until Jerry and Kurt were half done with the meal. They seemed excited and {{somewhat}} boisterous, Kurt thought, but once they settled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>eating,</b> after the manner of hungry laborers, they had little to say. Kurt, soon finishing his dinner, went outdoors to wait for Jerry. That individual appeared to be long in coming, and loud voices in the kitchen attested to further argument. At last, however, he lounged out and began to fill a pipe.|$|R
6000|$|Walt seemed satisfied. [...] "Well, {{my advice}} is: slow <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Darien time. <b>Eat</b> and sleep, and ride a bronco <b>to</b> make you <b>eat</b> more and sleep harder, {{and in two}} weeks you'll be like your old-time self." ...|$|R

60|$|The second night, {{or rather}} the peep of the third day, found us upon a very open hill, {{so that we could}} not follow our usual plan and lie <b>down</b> {{immediately}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and sleep.

50|$|As well {{as being}} eaten by humans, the soft-shelled clam is {{apparently}} relished by sea otters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where the clam is an invasive species (see image below). In New England the soft-shell clam is preyed heavily upon by northern moon snails and invasive green crabs. They are also a favorite of sea gulls, which pull the clam from the sand, climb to about 15 - 20 ft, and then drop the clam on a hard surface, breaking the shell. They then dive <b>down</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the soft parts of the clam before others can get to it.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{methods used}} include the [...] "Carlene Pop," [...] where the {{competitor}} {{jumps up and}} <b>down</b> while <b>eating,</b> <b>to</b> force the food <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the stomach.

50|$|Seating {{and serving}} customs play {{important}} roles in Chinese dining etiquette. For example, the diners should not sit <b>down</b> or begin <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> before the host (or guest of honor) has done so. When everyone is seated, the host offers to pour tea, beginning with the cup of the eldest person. The youngest person is served last {{as a gesture of}} respect for the elders.|$|R
