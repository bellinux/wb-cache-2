5000|$|The P6M-2 was an {{impressive}} aircraft; its Mach 0.9 (1,100 km/h) performance [...] "on the deck" [...] could be equaled by few aircraft of the time. The aircraft were heavily built, with the skin at the wing roots over 1 in thick. The normally docile and pleasant handling {{characteristics of the}} P6M-1 were replaced by some severe compressibility effects above Mach 0.8. These included rapid changes in <b>directional</b> <b>trim,</b> severe buffeting, and wing drop requiring high control inputs to counter. Until those problems were fixed, the P6M-2 could not be considered {{for use by the}} Fleet. The problems were identified as being caused by the larger engine nacelles required for the J75s. There were also problems on the water, including a tendency for the tip floats to dig in under certain situations, and engine surges. These problems were eventually solved, but time had run out just as the first crews were training for its operational debut. Eisenhower's administration was making major defense budget cuts that forced the Navy to make choices. In August 1959 Martin was told to halt operations and the program was about to be canceled. Seaplanes were a small community in Naval Aviation, and the P6M was significantly over budget and behind schedule and competing with aircraft carriers for funding. The Navy also had a potentially superior system for the nuclear strike role, the Ballistic Missile Submarine.|$|E

The conceptual design places Hamilton Standard SR- 7 turboprop blades close to the horizontal and vertical tail for potential acoustic shielding. Evaluation of the data shows generally favorable effects of power on aircraft stability and control, and that lateral <b>directional</b> <b>trim</b> can be achieved with one engine inoperative.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the static lateral stability and control characteristics of a l/ 6 -scale model of the Republic XF- 8 &H airplane with the propeller operating. The model had a 40 ' swept wing of aspect ratio 3. 45 and had a thin 3 -blade supersonic-type propeller. Many modifications to the basic configuration tiere investigated in ~ attempts to alleviate lateral and <b>directional</b> <b>trim</b> problems which appeared {{to be associated with}} propeller slipstream rotation. Although significant benefits were realized with several modifications, none of * those tested would be expected to afford satisfactory behavior for all normal flight conditions. A marked left-wing roll-off tendency was indicated at high angles of attack for the basic model configuration. Projection of only the left slat was the most effective remedy found for this problem with the propeller operating. The use of differential wing-flap deflection also appeared to offer a promising means for reducing the roll-off tendency with power on [...] The large sidewash over the vertical tail, associated with slip-stream rotation, severely restricted the condit ions for which <b>directional,</b> <b>trim</b> could be maintained. A small triangular dorsal fin, oriented oppo-site to the slipstream rotation, was found very effective in reducing the adverse sidewash flow at the tail. bo...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the flight dynamics and piloted control characteristics of the Helistat, a quadrotor heavy-lift airship, was completed using the HYBRDS airship simulation facility. The analysis covered the full operating flight envelope, including likely ranges of altitude, airspeed, sideslip, and loading variations. Particular areas of study were performance, trim, power requirements, linearized dynamics, handling qualities, and mooring operations. The key assumptions were: a rigid vehicle, no control system dynamics, fixed rotor and propeller RPM, and no ballonet dynamics. The nominal cruise speed for the H 34 engines operating at 1275 HP {{was found to be}} 40 - 50 kts, depending on the loading condition. The maximum payload capability was calculated as 45, 000 lbs for sea level-based operations. The crosswind capability in hover is 5 - 10 kts depending on the loading conditions, but this requires excessive roll angle due to the roll-to-translate control gearing. Sideslip angles of 110 - 135 degrees (wind from aft quarters) are critical for <b>directional</b> <b>trim</b> and stability, and should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|An early {{version of}} an {{external}} hydrogen-oxygen tank orbiter {{was used as a}} baseline vehicle to experimentally evaluate: (1) nose shape and canopy effects on longitudinal, lateral, and <b>directional</b> stability and <b>trim,</b> and (2) yaw due to aerodynamic roll control at hypersonic speeds. Nose alterations were examined since that part of the vehicle may be subject to modifications because of internal packaging requirements, alleviation of potential high heating areas, and/or possible improvements in aerodynamic stability and control. There was also some concern about the effect of the rather high profile canopy on the aerodynamics; therefore its removal was examined. In addition, roll-yaw coupling was investigated because of its impact on the RCS fuel requirements for entry maneuvers...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a completely automatic flight test program to test {{different aspects of the}} Shuttle flight capability during reentries is described. Data from each flight to date has been employed to devise a sequence of maneuvers which will be keyboard-punched into the Orbiter control system by the astronauts during entry phases of flight. Details of the interaction and cooperation of the Orbiter elevons and bodyflap to provide the vehicle with latitudinal and longitudinal <b>directional</b> control and <b>trim</b> are outlined. Uncertainties predicted for the control of the Orbiter during wind tunnel testing prior to actual flights have been adjusted to actual flight data, leading to the identification of actual flight regimes which need further investigation.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the Langley {{full-scale}} tunnel of the Grumman XF 6 f- 4 airplane in order to investigate the factors that affect the <b>directional</b> stability and <b>trim</b> characteristics of a typical fighter-type airplane. Eight representative flight conditions were investigated in detail. The separate contributions of the wing-fuselage combination, the vertical tail, and the propeller to the directional stability of the airplane in each condition were determined. Extensive air-flow surveys of sidewash angle and dynamic-pressure ratio along a line coincident with the rudder hinge line were made for each condition investigated to air evaluating the slipstream effects. The data obtained from the air-flow surveys were also used to investigate methods for calculating the contribution of the vertical tail to the airplane directional stability.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an externally jet-augmented flap system that would augment lift and provide direct-lift control. The model had a 35 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 82 and two side-by-side engines mounted on a single pylon under each wing close to the fuselage. The lift of the flap system was augmented by jet engine exhaust impingement on the triple-slotted flap surfaces. The rearmost flap provided direct lift control. Results were obtained for several combinations of flap deflections at gross thrust coefficients from 0 to 2. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with four engines operating. Limited longitudinal and lateral data are presented for asymmetric and symmetric thrust conditions with three engines operating. For the same overall flap deflection, lift coefficient and maximum lift coefficient were improved 13 and 7 percent compared to coefficients obtained with a double-slotted flap configuration. A maximum lift coefficient of 6. 3 was obtained at a gross thrust coefficient of 2. 0. At the same flap deflection lateral and <b>directional</b> <b>trim</b> moment requirements with an engine inoperative were reduced 55 and 33 percent, respectively, compared to those with the engines located farther outboard on the wing. Trim moment requirements in pitch were also reduced significantly. However, pitching-moment instability occurred and increased with gross thrust coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} of a model {{representative}} of a single-engine tractor-type airplane {{for the purpose of}} determining the stability and control effects of a propeller used as an aerodynamic brake. The tests were made with single-and dual-rotation propellers to show the effect of type of propeller rotation, and with positive thrust to provide basic data with which to compare the effects of negative thrust. Four configurations of the model were used to give the effects of tilting the propeller thrust axis down 5 deg., raising the horizontal tail, and combining both tilt and raised tail. Results of the tests are reported herein. The effects of negative thrust were found to be significant. The longitudinal stability was increased because of the loss of wing lift and increase of the angle of attack of the tail. Directional stability and both longitudinal and directional control were decreased because of the reduced velocity at the tail. These effects are moderate for moderate braking but become pronounced with full-power braking, particularly at high values of lift coefficient. The effects of model configuration changes were small when compared with the over-all effects of negative-thrust operation; however, improved stability and control characteristics were exhibited by the model with the tilted thrust axis. Raising the horizontal tail improved the longitudinal characteristics, but was detrimental to directional characteristics. The use of dual-rotation propeller reduced the <b>directional</b> <b>trim</b> charges resulting from the braking operation. A prototype airplane was assumed and handling qualities were computed and analyzed for normal (positive thrust) and braking operation with full and partial power. The results of these analyses are presented for the longitudinal characteristics in steady and accelerated flight, and for the directional characteristics in high- and low-speed flight. It was found that by limiting the power output of the engine (assuming the constant-speed propeller will function in the range of blade angles required for negative thrust) the stability and control characteristics may be held within the limits required for safe operation. Braking with full power, particularly at low speeds, is dangerous, but braking with very small power output is satisfactory from the standpoint of control. The amount of braking produced with zero power output is equal to or better than that produced by conventional spoiler-type brakes...|$|E
