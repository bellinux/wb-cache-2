5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide <b>diphosphates.</b> The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|Prenol lipids are {{synthesized}} {{from the}} five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, <b>diphosphates,</b> etc.) are {{formed by the}} successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, {{as well as the}} ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to <b>diphosphates</b> of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} work in RNA {{structural biology}} coincided, more or less, {{with the work}} being done on DNA in the early 1950s. [...] In their seminal 1953 paper, Watson and Crick suggested that van der Waals crowding by the 2`OH group of ribose would preclude RNA from adopting a double helical structure identical to the model they proposed - {{what we now know}} as B-form DNA. This provoked questions about the three-dimensional structure of RNA: could this molecule form some type of helical structure, and if so, how? [...] As with DNA, early structural work on RNA centered around isolation of native RNA polymers for fiber diffraction analysis. [...] In part because of heterogeneity of the samples tested, early fiber diffraction patterns were usually ambiguous and not readily interpretable. [...] In 1955, Marianne Grunberg-Manago and colleagues published a paper describing the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase, which cleaved a phosphate group from nucleotide <b>diphosphates</b> to catalyze their polymerization. This discovery allowed researchers to synthesize homogenous nucleotide polymers, which they then combined to produce double stranded molecules. [...] These samples yielded the most readily interpretable fiber diffraction patterns yet obtained, suggesting an ordered, helical structure for cognate, double stranded RNA that differed from that observed in DNA. [...] These results paved the way for a series of investigations into the various properties and propensities of RNA. [...] Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, numerous papers were published on various topics in RNA structure, including RNA-DNA hybridization, triple stranded RNA, and even small-scale crystallography of RNA di-nucleotides - G-C, and A-U - in primitive helix-like arrangements.

50|$|However, {{phosphates}} {{are most}} {{commonly found in}} the form of adenosine phosphates (AMP, ADP, and ATP) and in DNA and RNA, and can be released by the hydrolysis of ATP or ADP.

Phosphoanhydride bonds in ADP and ATP, or other nucleoside <b>diphosphates</b> and triphosphates, contain high amounts of energy which give them their vital role in all living organisms.

Compounds such as substituted phosphines have uses in organic chemistry, but do not seem to have any natural counterparts.|$|E
50|$|In {{all known}} organisms, the Deoxyribonucleotides {{that make up}} DNA are {{synthesized}} {{by the action of}} ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides.

All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds {{in the course of the}} reaction. RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with thioredoxin or glutaredoxin.|$|E
