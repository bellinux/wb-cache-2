25|$|<b>Flashbulb</b> {{memories}} are critical autobiographical memories about a major event.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flashbulb</b> memory {{occurs when}} a very vivid memory of a traumatic, emotional, or {{significant}} event is recalled. Researchers typically use public {{events such as the}} John F. Kennedy assassination and 9/11 as cues when studying <b>flashbulb</b> memories. Participants are asked to recall very specific information such as where they were, how they felt, and what they were doing when the event was taking place. Memories of these events are easily recalled and the individual believes their account of the event to be perfectly accurate.|$|E
25|$|These {{memories}} {{have been}} tested in different ways, including measuring the ability to recall details of the event {{and the impact of}} additional cues on the recall of the event. Denver, Lane and Cherry found that <b>flashbulb</b> memories {{that took place in the}} reminiscence bump were exceptionally vivid and easily accessible. It is suggested that the <b>flashbulb</b> memories encoded during the reminiscence bump are so vivid because the events happened during a time of identity formation and peak brain function. Additionally, these events are recalled well because they undergo more rehearsal due to their serious nature and frequent discussion.|$|E

25|$|Bart and Lisa {{are taking}} {{pictures}} atop Mt. Springfield when Bart starts a forest fire by carelessly discarding a hot <b>flashbulb.</b> The {{children are in}} imminent danger, and Barney and Homer must band together to save them. They hop into the helicopter, but land {{in the middle of}} a bridge when Barney panics over the task before him. When a Duff beer truck comes to a sudden stop, spilling its contents in front of a weakening Barney, Homer refuses to let him give up on sobriety and drinks an entire six-pack in his place. Together, Barney and a drunken Homer save the kids.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between emotion and memory is complex, but generally, emotion tends {{to increase the}} likelihood that an event will be remembered later and that it will be remembered vividly. <b>Flashbulb</b> memory is one example of this. An example of this would be an experience such as a close family member dying or the Christmas that you got the exact toy you wanted as a kid. The experience holds so much emotional significance that it is encoded as an extremely vivid, almost picture-perfect memory. However, whether the vividness of the <b>flashbulb</b> memory is due to a virtual [...] "flash" [...] that occurs because of the emotional experience has been hotly contested. <b>Flashbulb</b> memories may occur because of our propensity to rehearse and retell those highly emotional events, which strengthens the memory ...|$|E

5000|$|The light {{sculpture}} consisted of, [...] "a geometric {{array of}} steel cables stretching {{up through the}} multi-tiered atrium of the building, with 1,200 <b>flashbulbs</b> attached to the cables." ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{shutters}} have a flash synchronization {{switch to}} trigger a flash, if connected. This was quite a complicated matter with mechanical shutters and <b>flashbulbs</b> which took an appreciable time to reach full brightness, focal-plane shutters making this even more difficult. Special <b>flashbulbs</b> were designed which had a prolonged burn, illuminating the scene for the whole time taken by a focal plane shutter slit to move across the film. These problems were essentially solved for non-focal-plane shutters {{with the advent of}} electronic flash units which fire virtually instantaneously and emit a very short flash.|$|R
50|$|The {{brand names}} are {{intended}} to indicate that strobe flashes produce much shorter and more intense bursts of light than earlier photographic lighting systems, such as <b>flashbulbs,</b> or the continuous lighting used in some studio situations.|$|R
2500|$|Glucocorticoids {{act on the}} hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. Along with adrenaline, these {{enhance the}} {{formation}} of <b>flashbulb</b> memories of events associated with strong emotions, both positive and negative. This has been confirmed in studies, whereby blockade of either glucocorticoids or noradrenaline activity impaired the recall of emotionally relevant information. Additional sources have shown subjects whose fear learning was accompanied by high cortisol levels had better consolidation of this memory (this effect was more important in men). The effect that glucocorticoids have on memory {{may be due to}} damage specifically to the CA1 area of the hippocampal formation. [...] In multiple animal studies, prolonged stress (causing prolonged increases in glucocorticoid levels) have shown destruction of the neurons in this area of the brain, which has been connected to lower memory performance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flashbulb</b> {{memories}} can be produced, but do {{not need}} to be, from a positive or negative event. Studies have shown that <b>flashbulb</b> memories may be produced by experiencing a type of brand-related interaction. It was found that two brands produced a definitional <b>flashbulb</b> memory, but brands lacking strongly differentiated positioning do not produce a <b>flashbulb</b> memory. These [...] "flashbulb brand memories" [...] were viewed very much like conventional <b>flashbulb</b> memories for the features of strength, sharpness, vividness, and intensity.|$|E
50|$|It was {{proposed}} that the intensity of initial emotional reaction, rather than perceived consequentiality, is a primary determinant of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. <b>Flashbulb</b> memories of the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan were studied, and {{it was found that}} participants had accurate <b>flashbulb</b> memories seven months after the shooting. Respondents reported <b>flashbulb</b> memories, despite low consequentiality ratings. This study only evaluated the consequence of learning about a <b>flashbulb</b> event, and not how the consequences of being involved with the event affects accuracy. Therefore, some people were unsure of the extent of injury, and most could only guess about the eventual outcomes. Two models of <b>flashbulb</b> memory state that the consequences of an event determines the intensity of emotional reactions. The Importance Driven Emotional Reactions Model indicates that personal consequences determine intensity of emotional reactions. The consequence of an event is a critical variable in the formation and maintenance of a <b>flashbulb</b> memory. These propositions were based on <b>flashbulb</b> memories of the Marmara earthquake. The other model of <b>flashbulb</b> memory, called the Emotional-Integrative model, proposes that both personal importance and consequentiality determine the intensity of one's emotional state. Overall, the majority of research found on <b>flashbulb</b> memories demonstrates that consequences of an event {{play a key role in}} the accuracy of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. The death of Pope John Paul II did not come as a surprise but <b>flashbulb</b> memories were still found in individuals who were affected. This shows a direct link between emotion and event memory, and emphasizes how attitude can play a key factor in determining importance and consequentially for an event. Events being high in importance and consequentially lead to more vivid and long-lasting <b>flashbulb</b> memories.|$|E
50|$|Electronic flash was {{developed}} in the late 1950s while <b>flashbulbs</b> were still in general use. Early units were expensive and often large and heavy as the power unit was a separate unit to the flash gun head and was powered by a large lead-acid battery, and usually carried by the photographer by means of a shoulder strap. Towards the end of the 1960s, the size had dropped {{to the point where they}} were matching the size of conventional bulb flash guns (though the price, having dropped, was still an obstacle). The electronic flash system eventually superseded bulb guns as prices came down, rendering <b>flashbulbs</b> virtually obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Kodak Brownie Starlet, the Starflash {{features}} an integrated flashgun accepting M-2 style <b>flashbulbs,</b> {{as well as}} M-5 and M-25 bulbs for longer range photos. The viewfinder is slightly smaller to accommodate the large parabolic reflector.|$|R
50|$|Nikon's {{competitors}} like Canon and Ricoh use {{the similar}} name Speedlite for their flashes. Both names indicate that strobe flashes produce much shorter and more intense bursts of light than earlier photographic lighting systems, such as <b>flashbulbs,</b> or continuous lamps {{used in some}} studio situations.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{feel that}} <b>flashbulb</b> {{memories}} are not accurate {{enough to be}} considered their own category of memory. One of the issues is that <b>flashbulb</b> memories may deteriorate over time, just like everyday memories. Also, it has been questioned whether <b>flashbulb</b> memories are significantly different from everyday memories.A number of studies suggest that <b>flashbulb</b> memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. [...] Many experimenters question the accuracy of <b>Flashbulb</b> Memories, but rehearsal of the event is to blame. Errors that are rehearsed through retelling and reliving can {{become a part of}} the memory. Because <b>Flashbulb</b> memories happen only a single time, there are no opportunities for repeated exposure or correction. Errors that are introduced early on are more likely to remain. Many individual see these events that create <b>Flashbulb</b> memories as very important and want to [...] "never forget", which may result in overconfidence in the accuracy of the <b>flashbulb</b> memory.The most important thing in creating a <b>flashbulb</b> memory is not what occurs at the exact moment of hearing striking news, rather what occurs after hearing the news. The role of post-encoding factors such as retelling and reliving is important when trying to understand the increase in remembrance after the event has already taken place.|$|E
5000|$|The latent {{structure}} of a <b>flashbulb</b> memory is taxonic, and qualitatively distinct from non-flashbulb memories. It {{has been suggested that}} there are [...] "optimal cut points" [...] on <b>flashbulb</b> memory features that can ultimately divide people who can produce them from those who cannot. This follows the idea that <b>flashbulb</b> memories are a recollection of [...] "event-specific sensory-perceptual details" [...] and are much different from other known autobiographical memories. Ordinary memories show a dimensional structure that involves all levels of autobiographical knowledge, whereas <b>flashbulb</b> memories appear to come from a more densely integrated region of autobiographical knowledge. <b>Flashbulb</b> memories and non-flashbulb memories also differ qualitatively and not just quantitatively. <b>Flashbulb</b> memories are considered a form of autobiographical memory but involve the activation of episodic memory, where as everyday memories are a semantic form of recollections. Being a form of autobiographical recollections <b>flashbulb</b> memories are deeply determined by the reconstructive processes of memory, and just like any other form of memory are prone to decay.|$|E
50|$|Although {{people of}} all ages {{experience}} <b>flashbulb</b> memories, different demographics and ages can influence the strength and quality of a <b>flashbulb</b> memory.|$|E
5000|$|Some noted banquet photographers were Edward Kelty who was {{an early}} banquet camera user who photographed circuses predominately with {{traditional}} banquet cameras. Robert B. MacKay used Cirkut cameras which worked outside and spun, whereas the traditional banquet camera with <b>flashbulbs</b> worked just as well inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{flashtube}} {{was invented}} by Harold Edgerton in the 1930s {{as a means to}} take sharp photographs of moving objects. Flashtubes were mainly used for strobe lights in scientific studies, but eventually began {{to take the place of}} chemical and powder <b>flashbulbs</b> and flash lamps in mainstream photography.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2016, Rachel Syme of The New York Times {{described}} the magazine as [...] "a beautiful annual that remains staunchly avant-garde in {{its commitment to}} work that is oblique, enigmatic and impossible to ignore[...] [...]stories that leave a <b>flashbulb's</b> glow behind the eyes even as they resist sense." ...|$|R
5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>flashbulb</b> {{memories}} can result from non-surprising events, such as the first moon landing, and also from non-consequential events. While Brown and Kulik defined <b>flashbulb</b> memories as memories of first learning about a shocking event, they expand their discussion to include personal events in which the memory is of the event itself. Simply asking participants to retrieve vivid, autobiographical memories {{has been shown to}} produce memories that contain the six features of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. Therefore, it has been proposed that such memories be viewed as products of ordinary memory mechanisms. [...] Moreover, <b>flashbulb</b> memories {{have been shown to be}} susceptible to errors in reconstructive processes, specifically systematic bias. It has been suggested that <b>flashbulb</b> memories are not especially resistant to forgetting. A number of studies suggest that <b>flashbulb</b> memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. [...] Therefore, it is argued that it may be more precise to define <b>flashbulb</b> memories as extremely vivid autobiographical memories. Although they are often memories of learning about a shocking public event, they are not limited to such events, and not all memories of learning about shocking public events produce <b>flashbulb</b> memories.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{positive}} <b>flashbulb</b> memories, events seen as negative {{by a person}} have demonstrated having used more detailed- oriented, conservative processing strategies. Negative <b>flashbulb</b> memories are more highly unpleasant causing a person to avoid reliving the negative event. This avoidance could possibly lead to a reduction of emotional intense memory. The memory stays intacted in an individual who experiences a negative <b>flashbulb</b> memory but have a more toned down emotional side. With negative <b>flashbulb</b> memories they are seen to have more consequences.|$|E
50|$|Brown and Kulik {{emphasized}} that importance {{is a critical}} variable in <b>flashbulb</b> memory formation. In {{a study conducted by}} Brown and Kulik, news events were chosen so that some of them would be important to some of their subjects, but not to others. They found that when an event was important to one group, it was associated with a comparatively high incidence of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. The same event, when judged lower on importance by another group, was found to be associated with a lower incidence of <b>flashbulb</b> memory. The retelling or rehearsal of personally important events also increases the accuracy of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. Personally important events tend to be rehearsed more often than non-significant events. A study conducted on <b>flashbulb</b> memories of the Loma Prieta earthquake found that people who discussed and compared their personal stories with others repeatedly had better recall of the event compared to Atlanta subjects who had little reason to talk about how they had heard the news. Therefore, the rehearsal of personally important events can be important in developing accurate <b>flashbulb</b> memories. There has been other evidence that shows that personal importance of an event is a strong predictor of <b>flashbulb</b> memories. A study done on the <b>flashbulb</b> memory of the resignation of the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, found that the majority of UK subjects had <b>flashbulb</b> memories nearly one year after her resignation. Their memory reports were characterized by spontaneous, accurate, and full recall of event details. In contrast, a low number of non-UK subjects had <b>flashbulb</b> memories one year after her resignation. Memory reports in this group were characterized by forgetting and reconstructive errors. The <b>flashbulb</b> memories for Margaret Thatcher's resignation were, therefore, primarily associated with the level of importance attached to the event.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{flash powder}} {{in an open}} lamp was {{replaced}} by flashbulbs; magnesium filaments were contained in bulbs filled with oxygen gas, and electrically ignited by a contact in the camera shutter. [...] Manufactured <b>flashbulbs</b> were first produced commercially in Germany in 1929. [...] Such a bulb could only be used once, and was too hot to handle immediately after use, but the confinement of what would otherwise have amounted to a small explosion was an important advance. A later innovation was the coating of <b>flashbulbs</b> with a plastic film to maintain bulb integrity {{in the event of}} the glass shattering during the flash. A blue plastic film was introduced as an option to match the spectral quality of the flash to daylight-balanced colour film. Subsequently, the magnesium was replaced by zirconium, which produced a brighter flash.|$|R

50|$|Born in Russia, Schwartz went to America in 1906. He {{started in}} the New York Times in 1922, staying with the paper until 1926, {{when he moved to}} the Jewish Daily Forward, where he was a staff {{photographer}} until 1931. In 1930, Schwartz invented a flash synchronizer for work with <b>flashbulbs,</b> then novel replacements for flash powder.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flashbulb</b> {{memory has}} always been {{classified}} {{as a type of}} autobiographical memory, which is memory for one's everyday life events. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party or a barbecue, were contrasted with emotionally arousing events that were classified as <b>flashbulb</b> memories. Memory for the neutral autobiographical events was not as accurate as the emotionally arousing events of Princess Diana's death and Mother Teresa's death. Therefore, <b>flashbulb</b> memories were more accurately recalled than everyday autobiographical events. [...] In some cases, consistency of <b>flashbulb</b> memories and everyday memories do not differ, as they both decline over time. Ratings of vividness, recollection and belief in the accuracy of memory, however, have been documented to decline only in everyday memories and not <b>flashbulb</b> memories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flashbulb</b> memory {{research}} {{tends to}} focus on public events that have a negative valence. There is a shortage on studies regarding personal events such as accidents or trauma. This {{is due to the}} nature of the variables needed for <b>flashbulb</b> memory research: the experience of a surprising event is hard to manipulate. Additionally, little research has been done on gender differences and <b>flashbulb</b> memory, although it exists for general memory.|$|E
50|$|An Emotional-Integrative Model of <b>flashbulb</b> {{memories}} integrates the two {{previously discussed}} models the Photographic Model and the Comprehensive Model. Similar to the Photographic Model, the Emotional-Integrative Model {{states that the}} first step toward the registration of a <b>flashbulb</b> memory is an individual's degree of surprise associated with the event. This level of surprise triggers an emotional feeling state, which is also a result of the combination of the level of importance (consequentiality) of the event to the individual, and the individual's affective attitude. The emotional feeling state of the individual directly contributes {{to the creation of a}} <b>flashbulb</b> memory. To strengthen the association, thus enabling the individual to vividly remember the event, emotional feeling state and affective attitude contribute to overt rehearsal (mediator) of the event to strengthen the memory of the original event which, in turn, determines the formation of a <b>flashbulb</b> memory. According to the Emotional-Integrative model <b>flashbulb</b> memories can also be formed for expected events. The formation of <b>flashbulb</b> memories in this case depends greatly on a high emotional relationship to the event and rehearsal of the memory.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have tested}} this theory {{extensively}} {{in order to}} determine whether it is viable. The overwhelming evidence has shown the Now Print! hypothesis to be unsupported.
