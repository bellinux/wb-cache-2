500|$|Wal-Mart {{refused to}} carry the album as it {{contains}} a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members {{did not wish to}} change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, [...] "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> feel like you're in 1953 or something." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just feel}} like this record is really different- youve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|The record reached {{number one}} on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., where it sold 215,000 copies in its first week, which was a {{shortened}} three days.

In Canada, the album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 30,000 copies in its first week. The album debuted at the top of sales charts in twenty four total countries, including a peak of {{number one on the}} European Top 100 Albums. 21st Century Breakdown was only released in a Parental Advisory version containing explicit lyrics and content; Walmart refuses to sell albums with a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members responded by stating: [...] "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> feel like you're in 1953 or something." [...] The second single, [...] "21 Guns", was released to radio stations on May 25.

500|$|As the Sam & Max comics {{had a more}} adult tone, Steve Purcell {{expected}} LucasArts to {{cut back}} [...] "the edgier material" [...] from the game. However, he expressed that he was pleased with how LucasArts allowed him {{to stay close to}} his original vision for the game. The game's various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving the main game's puzzles and play something [...] "short and silly". Sam & Max Hit the Road also signified a major change in development for games on the SCUMM engine. The user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in Maniac Mansion and built upon in subsequent games. Instead of selecting a verb function from a list {{at the bottom of the}} screen and clicking on an in-game entity, Sam & Max Hit the Road compressed all verb functions into the mouse cursor, which players could cycle through using the right-mouse button. The inventory was also moved off the main screen to a sub-screen accessible by a small icon on the screen. According to Steve Purcell, this cleared space on the screen to [...] "expand on the excellent backgrounds and also made interaction much quicker and less laborious than LucasArts' previous adventure games" [...] The conversation trees were also affected by this; Michael Stemmle proposed removing the text-based selection menu used in previous LucasArts' adventure games in favor of icons representing topics of discussion as [...] "nothing would kill a joke worse than reading <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> hear it". Several of these innovations were retained for future LucasArts adventure games.|$|E
2500|$|One supervisor, Jim Burton of Blue Ridge, {{tried to}} be serious. He {{reminded}} the board that [...] "warp" [...] had other meanings. [...] "You {{need to think about}} <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> vote on it" [...] he warned. [...] "Would you prefer 'Beam me up, Scotty?'", the board's chairman replied. In the end the vote was unanimous. [...] "What more uplifting motion could there possibly be than something that will literally make law out of a Star Trek joke?" [...] concluded Miller. [...] "It's a great idea. I look forward to driving on Warp Drive myself." [...] Orbital agreed to reimburse the county for the approximately $500 it would cost to replace the street sign.|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{questioned}} on Meet the Press by Tim Russert for asking that US$400 million in previously earmarked funds be directed {{back to his}} district for water projects, a nursing program, to expand a hospital cancer center and US$10 million to promote Texas shrimp. On Meet the Press, Paul defended his bid for the earmarked funds saying he never voted for an earmark in his life. Russert said Paul's statement was like saying, [...] "you voted for <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> voted against it." [...] Congressman Paul responded,"I put them in because I represent people who are asking for some of their money back, ... I'm against the tax system, but I take all my tax credits. I {{want to get their}} money back for the people." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 March 1839 an {{informal}} meeting {{of members of}} the Colonisation Association and the 1825 New Zealand Company learned from Hutt the disturbing news that the Government's Bill for the colonisation of New Zealand would contain a clause that land from then on would [...] be able to be bought only from the Government. Such a move would be a catastrophic blow for the Colonisation Association, for whom success depended on being able to acquire land at a cheap price, directly from Māori, and then sell it at a high price to make a profit for shareholders and fund colonisation. The news created the need for swift action if private enterprise was to beat the Government to New Zealand. In a stirring speech, Wakefield told those present: [...] "Possess yourselves of the soil and you are secure—but if from delay you allow others to do <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you,</b> they will succeed and you will fail." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{review of}} the {{software}} suite, Edward Mendelsohn of PC Magazine wrote that the suite was [...] "visually elegant" [...] with [...] "effortless collaboration", but that Docs, Sheets and Slides were [...] "less powerful than desktop-based suites". Comparing Google's office suite with Microsoft's and Apple's, he stated that [...] "Docs exists only in your Web browser", meaning that users have [...] "more limited feature set" [...] than [...] "the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as [...] "less convenient than a desktop app, {{and you have to}} remember to install <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> need it". Mendelsohn praised the user interface, describing it as [...] "elegant, highly usable" [...] with [...] "fast performance", and that the revision history [...] "alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the [...] "niftiest new feature" [...] in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Office files as [...] "impressive fidelity". In summarization, he praised the suite for having [...] "the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too", while noting that [...] "it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing". In 2011, Paul Sawers of The Next Web described Google Docs as a [...] "pretty robust set of free tools that are improving every month". In a 2016 review of Google's G Suite business subscription service, Eric Grevstad of PC Magazine stated that Google Docs follows the [...] "80/20" [...] rule: [...] "that is, 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features".|$|E
