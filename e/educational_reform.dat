At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as <b>educational</b> <b>reform</b> and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

The origin of <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> is assumed to be closely related to the policy formulation and implementation process. The reforms are conceptualized within the framework of three perspective on change. Policy formulation and implementation are interpreted as complementary processes and it is argued that inappropriate perception of the implementation process is often the cause of failure I archiving the desired results from <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> or policy initiatives. Acceptability or non-acceptability of <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> are based on the question of responsiveness and compliance of the different groups changed with implementing the reforms. The co-operation of grassroot members and their institutional leaders is also considered crucial in implementing the reforms. Thus conflicts of interests have to be tolerated in order to maintain a balance amongst conflicting parties in the reform process. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors of}} the essay present both {{historic}} dimensions and main tendencies of organizational assumptions and curricular <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> in Polish territories from the Enlightenment till the Second World War. Research shows that challenges of civilization, changes of the sets of upbringing and attempts to offer democratic access of society to education were factors which stimulated and directed the processing of <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> in then Europe, Poland included. The main <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> were initiated by processes {{of social and political}} changes. The state was the mainspring of <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> in Europe of modern times. During the Enlightenment, the state took over schools, which resulted in adopting an act establishing the National Education Commission. In the Duchy of Warsaw, the Educational Association created a framework of educational administration connected with the social factor of school supervision. The development of educational legislation took place {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century. At that time education in Polish territories was connected with the schooling systems of the invaders. The reforms initiated by Poles were to modernize the Polish nation and strengthen its social, political and economic condition. The <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> in Poland after regaining Independence were to help rebuild, modernize and strengthen the reborn state. 327191 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|R

40|$|An {{association}} between {{health and education}} has been well-established empirically. It is not clear however whether this represents a causal effect and, if so, in which direction. Recent research has attempted to unravel this by using <b>educational</b> <b>reforms,</b> such as compulsory schooling laws, as exogenous sources of variation in education and examining their long-run effects {{on a variety of}} health outcomes. When proper account is taken of age, cohort, and state specific effects, it is difficult to establish a credible causal link from <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> which affect the quantity of education to health. Thus the balance of research so far suggests that it would be imprudent to assign a causal effect from <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> to long-run health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of political support for the privatization {{of education in the}} UK. The electorate is assumed to apply cost-benefit calculations, depending on their circumstances; a set of criteria for evaluating <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> is linked to individual voters' characteristics. It is then possible to identify which voters would oppose or advocate <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> such as greater school competition, ability selection and promotion of private schooling. Support for these reforms is then estimated using the British Educational Panel Survey (1997). The results indicate that political preferences largely reflect the anticipated personal costs and benefits from <b>educational</b> <b>reforms.</b> Those with children are in favour of reforms to raise school competition; those working in the education sector are against such reform. Those with higher anticipated tax liabilities favour privatization and support private schooling. Overall, however, <b>educational</b> <b>reforms</b> toward privatization received only minority support in Britain as of 1997. March 2001 Clive R.
