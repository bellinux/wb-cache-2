25|$|The SAR carbine variant, {{generally}} {{known as}} Glilon, is configured with a shorter barrel (332mm, 13.07in). Due to the shorter barrel a corresponding shorter piston and <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> {{as well as}} a unique gas block are found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being in use with the Armored Corps until the late 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|Gas is tapped {{from the}} barrel as the bullet moves past a gas port located above the rifle's front sight base. The gas expands into the port {{and down a}} <b>gas</b> <b>tube,</b> located above the barrel that runs from the front sight base into the AR-15's upper receiver. Here, the <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> {{protrudes}} into a [...] "gas key" [...] (bolt carrier key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the bolt carrier.|$|E
2500|$|The M14K is a {{commercial}} {{version of the}} M14 designed and built by Timothy F. LaFrance of La France Specialties of San Diego, California, most using forged receivers produced by Smith Enterprise of Tempe, Arizona. This rifle has a custom-made short barrel with a custom-made flash suppressor, shortened operating rod, and employs a unique <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> system. [...] Fully automatic versions have a removable flash suppressor. [...] Semi-automatic versions (of which very few were made) have a silver-brazed flash hider {{to comply with the}} requirement that Title I firearms have a 16" [...] barrel. [...] Most M14Ks employ the M60 <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> system. [...] Some late-model M14Ks employ a custom-designed and manufactured gas system. [...] Both are intended to control the rate of fire in fully automatic mode. [...] The rear sight is a custom-made National Match type aperture, and the front sight is a custom-made narrow blade, wing-protected sight {{to take advantage of the}} additional accuracy afforded by the special barrel.|$|E

2500|$|The SG 551 carbine has a short pattern [...] barrel, <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> and piston {{compared}} to the SG 550. The SG 551 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The handguards were also changed and the bipod removed. The SG 551 cannot be used with a bayonet or fire rifle grenades. The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces. Among those variants are the SG 551-1P police carbine (designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser), the SG 551 SWAT carbine (coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with {{a wide array of}} sights, and can also accept mission-critical accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light) and the SG 551 LB carbine with an extended [...] barrel that enables the use of rifle grenades and a bayonet.|$|E
2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and <b>gas</b> <b>tube,</b> ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report details the background to surge arresters and surge protective device components, viz., spark gaps, <b>gas</b> discharge <b>tubes</b> and metal oxide varistors. Current surge protective device technologies are detailed for several of the larger surge protective device manufacturers worldwide. Tests were performed using both 8 / 20 μs and 10 / 350 μs current impulses to verify the voltage and current response of <b>gas</b> discharge <b>tubes</b> with or without series MOVs and triggering circuits. Measurements obtained from the test setup were compared against each other, sharing a total impulse current of 35. 8 kA peak using an 8 / 20 μs waveform and 10. 2 kA peak using a 10 / 350 μs current impulse waveform. In the work presented, it is shown that series varistors dampened any voltage and current oscillatory behaviour superimposed from the current impulse generator due to their voltage clamping properties, which similarly do not allow any follow current to flow after a surge has subsided. No effect was seen by using a single varistor or a many parallel mounted varistors in series with a <b>gas</b> discharge <b>tube.</b> By using three electrode <b>gas</b> discharge <b>tubes</b> with a triggering circuit, the clamping voltage was reduced, as the <b>gas</b> <b>tubes</b> reacted faster than an equivalent circuit without a triggering module, which {{has the advantage of}} reducing the protection level for the protected equipment...|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} {{of the system is}} highly dependent on the length of both barrel and <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> which transports gas from the barrel to the bolt. Using too short a <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> can result in increased pressure inside the bolt assembly and increased rate of automatic fire, both of which can have detrimental effect on the weapon and accuracy of shots. Use of silencer also increases the barrel length, further aggravating the situation. The problem can be reduced by using a longer <b>gas</b> <b>tube</b> (also placing the gas port on the barrel forward) and/or by installing a variable gas block which can be adjusted to provide the right amount of gas for a proper {{operation of}} the weapon.|$|E

50|$|Dräger {{was one of}} a few {{companies}} who were early pioneers of colorimetric <b>gas</b> detector <b>tubes</b> (also known as detector tubes) used to measure the concentration of gases present. In a typical colorimetric <b>gas</b> detector <b>tube</b> a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different.
