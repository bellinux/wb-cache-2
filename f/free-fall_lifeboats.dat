40|$|The {{evacuation}} of personnel from an offshore installation in severe weather conditions is generally ensured by <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> During the water entry {{phase of the}} launch, the lifeboat {{may be subject to}} large acceleration loads that may cause harmful acceleration-induced loads on the occupants.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the safety of}} occupants in <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats</b> launched from turret-moored floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels. It presents a methodology for assessing operational limits with respect to acceleration-induced loads experienced by the passengers during water entry. The probability of being injured is estimated by means of numerical simulations for several seat rows and in various sea states {{described in terms of}} significant wave height and mean wind velocity. Those results are therefore practical for on-site decisions regarding the use of the <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> The numerical simulations performed to estimate the 6 -degrees of freedom (6 -DOF) water entry accelerations in the lifeboats are based on more than 50 years of hindcast metocean data. These consist of sea state parameters provided every third hour and including the significant wave height, the peak period and the direction of both wind-sea and swell as well as the direction and mean velocity of the wind. In a first step, the motion of the FPSO is computed for the whole time period covered by hindcast metocean data, using a state-of-the art numerical model validated against experimental data. The model includes nonlinear excitation forces, a dynamic positioning system with a realistic heading control strategy, mooring line forces as well as turret-hull coupling. The obtained FPSO motion is then used in Monte Carlo simulations of lifeboat launches performed for selected time windows in the original metocean hindcast database corresponding to selected intervals of the significant wave height and mean wind velocity. In addition to the 6 -DOF skid motion, the lifeboat launch simulations account for the effects of wind and waves diffracted by the FPSO hull. Finally, a probabilistic model describing the joint-distribution of several injury types and water entry acceleration parameters computed through the launch simulations is used to evaluate the injury probability. The results are presented in term of seating matrices showing critical seat rows, in which the probability of being injured exceeds a pre-defined threshold...|$|E
40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} interest {{in oil and}} gas exploration in the Barents Sea, it is important to identify all the challenges related to petroleum activity in that area. The objective of this thesis is to examine conditions relevant to the evacuation and rescue of personnel from facilities operating in the Barents Sea. The report considers the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea north of the Norwegian mainland, south of Bj&# 248;rn&# 248;ya, and extends towards the Norwegian/Russian border that came into effect in 2011. A specific case was made to analyze the following three Defined situations of hazard and accident (DSHA) :&# 10146;	Personnel in the sea {{as a result of a}} helicopter accident (DSHA 2) &# 10146;	Personnel in the sea during emergency evacuation (DSHA 3) &# 10146;	Personnel injury/sickness requiring external assistance (DSHA 7) Two scenarios were given: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. The first scenario should have a SAR helicopter stationed on a production facility, while the other scenario should have the SAR helicopter stationed on a floating base (for instance a standby vessel). The case study showed that land-based SAR helicopters would not fulfill the performance requirements regarding the three DSHAs mentioned above because the distances out to the actual facilities were too long. Having stationed a SAR helicopter offshore in a hangar is therefore a necessity, and placing the helicopter on a production facility is a better alternative than to station it on a floating base such as a standby vessel. A SAR helicopter, with an operational speed of 140 knot and a 15 min. mobilization time, could in the event of a helicopter accident (DSHA 2) manage to cover 82 Nm. while rescuing 21 persons from the sea. In the event of a DSHA 7, time of response in emergency medicine, the range could be 100 Nm. Long distances and a lack of infrastructure combined with the climatic conditions in the Barents Sea, lead to challenges that require special attention and management. Insufficient communication coverage around 70 - 75 &# 176;N and further north cause an extra challenge in achieving a safe emergency preparedness. The poor communication coverage also has an influence on the quality of weather forecasts. A good reliable weather forecast is essential to maintain a safe and secure operation. This is however difficult to achieve today due to few measuring points in the area. An increased activity in the Barents Sea will therefore improve the situation. Ice accretion is an issue that requires attention particularly for standby vessels, lifeboats, MOB boats and facilities. Drifting sea ice and icebergs is also something that has to be taken into consideration when operating north in the Barents Sea. Special attention has to be given to the use of <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats.</b> If there is sea ice in the area around a facility, the drop of <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats</b> cannot be carried through. Compensating measures then have to be taken into account. The challenges related to {{oil and gas exploration}} in the Barents Sea are manageable, but they require attention and the provision of suitable resources in the area. No single secondary evacuation method is currently available for year-round operation when sea ice is present. Before all-year round petroleum activity can be possible everywhere in the Barents Sea, emergency preparedness must be given sufficient attention so that some critical challenges can be solved. It seems to be a reasonable requirement that all producing fields in the Barents Sea, including exploration drilling, have an emergency preparedness standard that corresponds to the area-based emergency preparedness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Between 1985 and 1992, at the NUTEC {{training}} facility in Bergen training launches at heights of both 28 meters and 12. 5 meters took place. During this period sixteen injuries to personnel were sus-tained. It is not recorded {{if all the}} injuries were associated with a particular launch height and it is as-sumed that the injuries followed launches from both heights. It is noted that a higher number of injuries occur during on-board ship drills than during shore-based training.

40|$|<b>Free-falling</b> <b>lifeboats</b> are {{a method}} of {{escaping}} hazardous events in open sea. They rest at a skid until released and launched into the water. It {{is important that the}} use of <b>free-falling</b> <b>lifeboats</b> ensure a safe evacuation. In this master thesis, a simplified <b>free-falling</b> <b>lifeboat</b> geometry has been used to investigate the physical phenomena connected with this evacuation method. The hydrodynamic results are obtained with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, Star-CCM+, and the structural results from a finite element method (FEM) program, Abaqus. There has been conducted a sensitivity and convergence study of the CFD simulations, and a convergence check for the FEM model. The lifeboat has been solved with seven different parameters under the assumption that the air is incompressible, where the main initial conditions were a water entry angle of 60 degrees, a velocity of 20, 61 m/s and with centre of gravity - 0. 5 m in zbody-direction from the body centreline. These initial conditions have been changed with ± 5 degrees for the water entry angle, ± 5 m/s for the body fixed velocity and ± 0. 2 m for the centre of gravity. For the structural assessment only the initial conditions have been used, but with four load cases. One load case where only inputs to Abaqus from Star-CCM+ for the aft is established (one-way coupling) with air modelled as incompressible. Two load cases where inputs are given to both of the programs (two-way coupling) for the hull and aft, with air as incompressible. The fourth load case {{is the same as the}} first load case, but with air modelled as compressible. Results from the initial conditions shows that the lifeboat experiences the same physical phenomena as a real lifeboat. It experiences an air cavity closure on the aft and it follows the preferred trajectory suggested by DNV-GL. For the parameter investigation, it was shown that the change in water entry velocity gave the largest difference on most of the results, with respect to the initial conditions. This includes a variation of the air cavity closure time and peak magnitude, and water exit time. The change in water entry angle gave the largest change in maximum submersion compared with the initial conditions. The difference in maximum submersion created also a larger pressure on the aft, due to the hydrostatic pressure. The change in COGz did not create much differences on the results. When using a one-way coupling simulation, with air modelled as incompressible, the structural results were unrealistic. Where all the different shell thicknesses exceeded yield and ultimate strength. It was found that hydroelastic effects matter for this load case. With the two-way coupling, for the aft, the results were almost the same. Due to a coarser mesh discretization in the CFD simulations with the two-way coupling, the results from one-way and two-way coupling are not comparable. When the air was modelled as compressible the response from the aft with a shell thickness of 20 mm was found to be quasi-static. With this thickness, the aft was also able to withstand the stresses from the air cavity closure and the air bubbles oscillations. When using the hull in the two-way coupling it was seen that the splash crown had the largest influence on the stresses on the lifeboat. Here the 20 mm, 10 mm and 5 mm shell thickness were able to withstand these stresses without going into the plastic zone, while a shell thickness of 2. 5 mm exceeded the Tresca yield criterion. It was also found that the solution obtained was of a quasi-static approach...|$|R
40|$|A free- falling {{lifeboat}} is a {{last resort}} evacuation system, installed on many rigid and floating offshore structures. The diving process of a <b>free-falling</b> <b>lifeboat</b> is a complex matter, as the external forces varies through the process. The diving process is essentially divided into six different phases. These are the launching phase, free-falling phase, water entry phase, submerged phase, water exit phase and the sail away phase. The launching and free-falling phase determines the initial conditions {{at the point of}} impact, typically this will be impact velocity, water entry angle and angular rotations. As the body enters the water, it will be subjected to slamming forces. The pitch motion initially turns from clockwise to counter clockwise rotation, leading to larger slamming forces on the aft part. Eventually the aft part crosses the water surface and there will be an air cavity formation. The gravity will press the two newly formed free surfaces together and the unavoidable collapse leads to a large pressure on the body, in its direction of motion. This is due to the pressure from the water on the newly formed air bubble, entrapped on the very aft part. The body reaches its maximum submergence and then it starts the ascent phase, driven by the buoyancy. In the case of a positive surge motion and a counter clockwise rotation, the body will get this additional contribution in the ascent. The body eventually exits the water, where it gets a certain pop-up height, this height depends on the exit velocity and angle. As the body re-enters the water surface it can be subjected to a second slamming, and its magnitude is dependent on the pop-up height and the rotation after the water exit. It is favourable that the body sail as far as possible away from the evacuation scene. And this distance is dependent on the other phases. A simplified <b>free-falling</b> <b>lifeboat</b> geometry were chosen for the simulations. The body is a semi-ellipsoid with length 10 m, and largest diameter 3 m. The simulations are run in the commercial software Star-CCM+. The simulations are computational expensive, and most of the simulations has been simulated on the high-performance computer, Vilje. A convergence check was preformed to investigate the quality of the solution and a suitable mesh size has been chosen with respect to satisfactory global behaviour and computational time. A simulation has been preformed in calm water conditions. The result and behaviour of the body is reasonable compared to theory. The body is subjected to large deaccelerations and counter clockwise pitch accelerations in the water entry phase. The formation of an air cavity and its collapse is clearly visual in VOF-scenes and as a large peak in the body-fixed acceleration plot. The body exits bow first, gets some air time, and is subjected to a small second slamming as it re-enters the water surface. A parameter investigation has been preformed where the impact velocity, water entry angle and centre of gravity in z-direction has been changed with ± 5 m/s, ± 5 ° and ± 0. 2 m, repectivly. The results showed that changing the velocity gave largest effect in the behaviour of the body, but the highest water entry angle gave the largest submergence which is an important parameter as it gives the highest hydrostatical pressure. Changing the centre of gravity showed to have relative small effects. The lifeboat will most likely be used in a storm-conditions. Eighteen different cases has been simulated, with four different wave phases in three different headings. Three of these has been tested for two additional steepnesses. The waves are modelled as regular linear waves. The results shows that the behaviour of the body is greatly affected when waves are included in the simulation. The wave forces contribute in form of Froude-Krylov forces, diffraction forces and additional drag forces. Some of the largest accelerations in the water entry phase are found when the body dives in the wave phase where the fluid velocity is acting upwards. Large accelerations in the water entry phase are also observed when the fluid velocity is acting in the same global x- direction as the body. This creates a large counter clockwise pitch velocity which increases the slamming load on the aft part. The second slamming is dependent on the water exit, where the exit velocity, water exit angle, wave phase and heading are decisive. The effect of decreasing the steepness was in general smaller accelerations in the water entry phase. The particle velocities are reduced as they are proportional to the wave amplitude. However, the second slamming is dependent on the water exit and the body rotation, and the CAR values shows that there can be large stresses on the passengers also in the case of small steepnesses. Uncertainties connected with the simulations are the segregated flow and its weakness in term of predicting impulse forces like slamming, and how this manifests further in the solution. There has also been detected some unreal large velocities at the aft corner, leading to uncertainties on how these will affect the solution. Some errors in the interpolation between the cells in the overset mesh will be present as the overset mesh does not have a uniform cell size...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{testing of}} {{lifeboat}} design {{has been carried}} out solely by experimental means. However, due to the large number of factors which influence the loads on the lifeboat structure and its occupants, optimization studies by experimental means have become both time-consuming and expensive. In addition, many effects cannot be studied at laboratory scale due to the inability to match all similarity requirements. Recent advances in computational fuid dynamics (CFD) have made it possible toanalyze the lifeboats performance under realistic conditions. By not being dependenton a physical model, investigation of a larger range of hull shapes at a variety of launch conditions can be done more easily and cost-ecient. This thesis explores the possibility of using the CD-adapco's CFD-software STARCCM+(STAR) to predict the performance of <b>free-fall</b> <b>lifeboats</b> during the impact phase. The thesis focuses on verification and validation of the software by studying water impact of different two and three-dimensional rigid and elastic wedges. For the two-dimensional case, 2 -D rigid wedges with constant vertical velocity andvarying deadrise angles (4 to 81 degrees) are studied with respect to various slammingparameters presented by Zhao and Faltinsen (1992). In the study, good agreementis found between the solution predicted in STAR and the presented numerical andanalytical solutions. It is found that the slamming pressures are strongly dependent onthe deadrise angle; from 300 Pa for the 81 deg. wedge, to 275 000 Pa for the 4 deg. wedge. It is seen that as the deadrise angle is decreased, better resolution in grid size and time step is required to capture the peak pressures. The three-dimensional case includes both rigid and elastic wedges. For the rigid case, a 3 -D wedge is modeled so to represent an experimental study conducted by Yettou et al. (2006). It is found that STAR predicts a lower impact velocity than what is found inthe experimental study. Following, the pressures predicted are too low. The differenceis however moderate, and STAR is able to predict the displacement and velocity-timehistories of the wedge in a satisfactory manner. It is noted that the reason for thediscrepancy lies in the prediction of motion through air - and not in the simulation ofimpact and motion in water. It is also noted that refinements in grid size and time stepare not of great importance if only displacements and velocities are to be studied. For the elastic wedge case, four different elastic wedges are studied to exploreSTAR's possibilities and limitations related to fuid-structure interaction (FSI). Noverification or validation with existing theory or experimental data is performed. Aqualitative assessment of the results is however carried out and it is found that STARpredicts displacements, velocities, accelerations, pressures, deflections and stresses in a satisfactory manner. </p...|$|E
