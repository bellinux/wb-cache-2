50|$|To {{facilitate}} efficient sterilization by {{steam and}} pressure, {{there are several}} methods of verification and indication used; these include color-changing indicator tapes and biological indicators. When using biological indicators, samples containing spores of heat-resistant microbes such as Geobacillus stearothermophilis are sterilized alongside a standard load, and are then incubated in sterile media (often contained within the sample in a glass ampule to be broken after sterilization). A color change in the media (indicating acid production by bacteria; requires the medium to be formulated for this purpose), or the appearance of turbidity (cloudiness <b>indicating</b> <b>light</b> scattering by bacterial cells) indicates that sterilization was not achieved and the sterilization cycle may need revision or improvement.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA rare type of {{mammalian}} retinal ganglion cell (RGC) {{expresses the}} photopigment melanopsin {{and is a}} photoreceptor. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) drive circadian-clock resetting, pupillary constriction, and other non-image-forming photic responses. Both the light responses of ipRGCs and the behaviors they drive are remarkably sustained, raising the possibility that, unlike rods and cones, ipRGCs do not adjust their sensitivity according to lighting conditions (“adaptation”). We found, to the contrary, that ipRGC sensitivity is plastic, strongly influenced by lighting history. When exposed to a constant, bright background, the background-evoked response decayed, and responses to superimposed flashes grew in amplitude, <b>indicating</b> <b>light</b> adaptation. After extinction of a light-adapting background, sensitivity recovered progressively in darkness, indicating dark adaptation. Because these adjustments in sensitivity persisted when synapses were blocked, they constitute “photoreceptor adaptation” rather than “network adaptation. ” Implications for the mechanisms generating various non-image-forming visual responses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The first {{structures}} were proto-voids {{formed in the}} primordial plasma. Viscous and weak turbulence forces balanced gravitational forces when the scale of causal connection at time 30, 000 years matched the viscous and turbulent Schwarz scales of hydro-gravitational theory (Gibson 1996). The photon viscosity allows only weak turbulence from the Reynolds number Re = 200, with fragmentation to give proto-supercluster voids, buoyancy forces, fossil vorticity turbulence, and strong sonic damping. The expanding, cooling, plasma continued fragmentation to proto-galaxy-mass with the density and rate-of-strain preserved as fossils of the weak turbulence and first structure. Turbulence fossilization by self-gravitational buoyancy explains {{the cosmic microwave background}} temperature fluctuations, not sonic oscillations in cold-dark-matter fragments. After plasma to gas transition at 300, 000 years, gas fragmentation occurred within the proto-galaxies to form proto-globular-star-cluster (PGCs) clouds of small-planetary-mass primordial-fog-particles (PFPs). Dark PGC clumps of frozen PFPs persist as the inner-galaxy-halo dark matter, supporting Schild's 1996 quasar-microlensing interpretation. Non-baryonic dark matter diffused into the plasma proto-cluster-voids and later fragmented as outer-galaxy-halos at diffusive Schwarz scales, <b>indicating</b> <b>light,</b> weakly-collisional fluid particles (possibly neutrinos).

His owner adopted him a week prior from a southern shelter as an apparently healthy young dog with an unknown history. The owner witnessed a friend’s cat scratch the dog as the dog approached the cat. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye, performed later, revealed a ventrotemporal full thickness corneal laceration with large iris prolapse and fibrin plug.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with an estimated 25 million date palms produces nearly a million tones of dates annually with a good potential for exporting the surplus produce. In order to standardize quality norms of major date cultivars in the Kingdom, studies were taken up at the National Date Palm Research Centre, Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia to ascertain fruit characteristics of dates (Tamar stage) in the cultivars Khalas, Sheshi and Reziz with respect to fruit weight (g), size of fruit (length and breath), number of fruits / 500 g, fruit moisture, colour and texture. Khalas recorded the maximum fruit length in all the three categories of large, medium and small sized fruits. With regard to the breath of fruits, the cultivar Sheshi registered the highest values. Further, Sheshi recorded the highest fruit weight values, which in turn influenced the number of fruits per unit weight, with Sheshi recording the least number of fruits per 500 g.

The obtained seedlings were grown on sand and irrigated with nutrient solution over 5 weeks under no (0 mMNaCl), moderate (200 mMNaCl), or high (400 mMNaCl) salinity conditions. A follow-up of gas exchange was performed weekly and pigment levels and patterns of fully expanded leaves were determined after 3 and 5 weeks of treatment. At {{the end of the}} 5 -week period, immunoblot analysis of the main polypeptides of photosystem I and II was performed with the aim to investigate salt-induced variations in photosystem composition. Net CO 2 assimilation rate (Pn) increased under salinity up to 3 weeks of treatment then decreased to reach the value of 0 mM-treated plants {{at the end of the}} experiment. For stomatal conductance (gs) and intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), the opposite occurred. These results were concomitant with an increase in practically all pigment levels, mainly under high salinity, with the exception of zeaxanthin. The de-epoxidation index (DEPS index) was much lower under saline than non-saline conditions in the 3 rd week, <b>indicating</b> <b>light</b> stress in 0 mM-treated plants. At the end of the experiment, this index showed much lower values with no significant differences between treatments, which coincided with no significant differences in gas exchange as well. Protein amounts of D 1, CP 47, and CP 43 did not show noticeable variations with salt treatment, whereas LHCII underwent a slight but significant decrease (− 15 %) at the highest NaCl concentration. LHCI polypeptides were unaffected by the salt treatments, where conversely, the highest concentration induced a significant decrease in PsaA/B amount (− 18 %) ...|$|E

This region has excellent potential for further study due to {{the availability of a}} wide range of archival multi-wavelength data, and we propose it as a low-redshift analog to the `deep fields' work on AGN at higher redshifts. We present distributions of luminosity, absorption, and other key quantities, from fitting new and archival X-ray data gathered from XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, ASCA and Swift/BAT. We probe to deeper redshifts than the 9 -month BAT catalog (= 0. 043), and uncover a broader absorbing column density distribution. The fraction of obscured (log N_H >= 22) objects in the sample is ~ 60 %, and 43 [...] 56 % of the sample exhibits `complex' 0. 4 [...] 10 keV spectra. The soft excess is either well-detected in AGN or undetected, suggesting that the process responsible for producing the soft excess is not ubiquitous. The fraction of Compton-thick sources in our sample is ~ 9 %, and `hidden/buried AGN' constitute ~ 14 % of our sample. Compton reflection is found to be important in a large fraction of our sample using joint XMM-Newton+BAT fits (reflection amplitude = 2. 7 +/- 0. 75), <b>indicating</b> <b>light</b> bending or extremely complex absorption.

The photon viscosity ν ≈ 4 × 1026 m 2 s− 1 suggests weak turbulence from the Reynolds number ReH ≡ c 2 t/ν ≈ 200, and fragmentation at ρL 3 SV ≈ 1016 M ⊙ to give proto-super-clusters, buoyancy forces, fossil turbulence, and strong sonic damping.

Turbulence fossilization and gravitational instability explain the small δT/T ≈ 10 − 5 cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations as evidence of earlier structure formation rather than sound waves.
