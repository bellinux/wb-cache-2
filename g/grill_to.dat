500|$|While early grills {{could not}} be removed easily and {{involved}} reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds.

[...] However, for inexpensive novelty grills, a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this himself.
