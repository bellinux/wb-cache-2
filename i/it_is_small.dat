5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small.</b> Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E
5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, and people have been bitten attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> emits reddish light, {{and has a}} {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, meaning that it radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century {{replacing}} a 685 AD Saxon building. Major restoration work {{was carried out}} in the 1860s, including the construction of the Via Crucis, which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church. Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop Thomas Ken. The tower has eight bells, which bear inscriptions indicating that they were cast at various points between 1622 and 1792. A daughter church of St John's, Christ Church, was built in 1818 by George Allen Underwood, although considerable changes were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The third Anglican Church, Holy Trinity, was built in 1837–38 by Henry Goodridge in the style of Commissioners' Gothic. It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the position in which the church was built. The stained glass windows are near-contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Finally, St Mary's at Innox Hill was built in 1863, by C.E. Giles, as another Chapel of Ease to St John's. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> with a decorated sanctuary ceiling.|$|E

25|$|Threshold Theory (TT). A {{number of}} {{previous}} research findings {{have suggested that}} a threshold exists {{in the relationship between}} creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> and weak. TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.|$|E
25|$|In the Dodge type jaw crushers, {{the jaws}} are farther {{apart at the}} top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the {{material}} is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> enough {{to escape from the}} bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is similar in}} basic concept to a jaw crusher, {{consisting}} of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> enough to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E

25|$|A player's {{choice of}} which scale to {{use is a}} direct {{reflection}} {{of the scope of}} the game to be played. For historical games, 15mm seems to be the most popular scale, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> enough to allow for large battles. Smaller scaled miniatures are typically mounted in groups and moved as groups. This creates the visual effect of a large mass of combatants, allowing games simulating platoon, company, battalion, and even corps level actions. In these cases, the miniatures are often mounted on trays, or bases, for ease of mass movement.|$|E
25|$|One {{candidate}} is the Heilongjiang hand cannon, discovered in 1970, and {{named after the}} province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> and light like the Xanadu gun, weighing only 3.5 kilograms, 34cm (Needham says 35cm), and a bore of approximately 2.5cm. Based on contextual evidence, historians believe it was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.|$|E
25|$|About half of {{the colonial}} {{buildings}} have been partially or fully converted into businesses such as stores, restaurants, galleries, workshops and hotels. Since there is no zoning, residential and commercial establishments are well-mixed. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> and rural, it has {{a wide variety of}} upscale and ethnic restaurants, specialty shops and art galleries. All around the historic center there are over 80 bars and cantinas as well as various nightclubs. To compete, many offer two-for-one drink specials. Others rely on gimmicks such as the frontier themed bar on Mesones Street called “El Gato” with swinging cantina doors like those seen on “Old West” movies.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{marriage}}s in Comoros, the Mna dabo (little marriage) and the ada (grand marriage). The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> intimate, and inexpensive. The bride price is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford the ada, or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bride price. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride’s family typically pays only a third of that of the groom’s. The grand wedding can cost up to £55,000. Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai are {{carefully}} styled to maintain miniaturization, to suggest age, {{and to meet}} the artist's aesthetic goals. Tree styling also occurs in a larger scale in other practices like topiary and niwaki. In bonsai, however, the artist has close control over every feature of the tree, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> and (in its container) easily moved and worked on. The greater scale of full-sized trees means that styling them may be restricted to pruning and shaping the exterior volume once per growing season, never pruning within the canopy nor bending and forming individual branches. In contrast, in a bonsai being prepared for display, each leaf or needle {{may be subject to}} decision regarding pruning or retention, and every branch and twig may be formed and wired into place each year. Given these differences in scope and purpose, bonsai styling uses a number of styling techniques either unique to bonsai or (if used in other forms of plant cultivation) applied in ways particularly suitable to meet the goals of bonsai development.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{samples of}} the gun, {{specifically}} the hand cannon (huochong), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the Xanadu Gun, so called because it was discovered {{in the ruins of}} Xanadu, the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns {{with the possible exception of}} the Western Xia gun, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length. Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.|$|E
