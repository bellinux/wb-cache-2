50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>pull</b> is an Inuit {{game where}} two people lie belly {{down on the}} ground, pull each other’s heads, and try to move the {{opponent}} across a line. The game is played with a loop placed around the competitors’ heads as they face each other. The loop is placed above the ears, and the game becomes more difficult the higher the loop is placed. The match is complete {{when one of the}} competitors either pulls their opponent across the line or if the loop slips off their opponent’s head.|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, list-maker and {{reviewer}} Jacob Hall wrote, [...] "Season three's 'Band Candy' {{is probably}} one of the goofiest episodes of the entire series, but it's also one of the funniest, showcasing the writing staff's tremendous wit and the range of the show's supporting cast. The episode deals with a dark enchantment forcing the adults of Sunnydale to revert to their teenage mentalities, transforming the likes of Giles, Mrs. Summers and Principal Snyder into hilarious alternate versions of themselves. As awesome as it is to see Anthony Stewart <b>Head</b> <b>pull</b> off a 'bad boy' thing, the episode more than earns its place on its list for Armin Shimerman's sad, pathetic and totally endearing take on his normally cruel character." ...|$|E

40|$|Contractile {{properties}} differ between skeletal, cardiac {{and smooth}} muscles {{as well as}} between various skeletal muscle fiber types. This functional diversity is thought to be mainly related to different speeds of myosin <b>head</b> <b>pulling</b> cycles, with the molecular mechanism of force generation being essentially the same. In this study, force-generating attachments of myosin heads were investigated by applying small perturbations of myosin <b>head</b> <b>pulling</b> cycles in stepwise stretch experiments on skeletal muscle fibers of different type. Slow fibers (frog tonic and rat slow-twitch) exhibited only a ‘slow-type’ of myosin head attachment over the entire activation range, while fast fibers (frog and rat fast-twitch) displayed a ‘slow-type’ of myosin head attachment at low levels of activation, and an up to 30 -times faster type at high levels of activation. These observations indicate that there are qualitative differences between the mechanisms of myosin head attachment in slow and fast vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers...|$|R

50|$|The <b>head</b> may be <b>pulled</b> back in some way, {{such as in}} head bondage. However, some purists {{argue that}} this goes against the idea of binding into a ball. Alternatively, the <b>head</b> can be <b>pulled</b> forward to force the chin to press against the chest.|$|R
50|$|Reins {{consist of}} leather straps or rope {{attached}} to the outer ends of a bit and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are {{the means by which}} a horse rider or driver communicates directional commands to the horse's <b>head.</b> <b>Pulling</b> on the reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so pulling on the reins pulls the bit, which then <b>pulls</b> the horse's <b>head</b> from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.|$|R

60|$|The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better. He {{had a fine}} constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went {{straight}} forward to recovery.

He often put his band to his <b>head,</b> <b>pulled</b> down the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel. But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself. Then she scolded him sharply.|$|R

Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas who are younger, smaller or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or original formula Karo syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.|$|R

After that we see a long shot of Cool's <b>head</b> <b>pulling</b> a selection of funny faces while his head spins all the way round. His head then explodes revealing a variety of Mechanical works and Cogs inside his head, the lights go out and the Cool It logo appears on screen.|$|R
