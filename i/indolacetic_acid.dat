Offshoots from these plants were cultured in vitro to obtain artichoke plantlets fungi and bacteria free to improve the quality of propagation material. Once transplanted in pots, the plantlets were inoculated with 10 g Glomus viscosum strain A 6 (AM fungus). Acclimatization was clearly facilitated by the addition of the AM fungus. Indeed, the mycorrhizal plantlets showed a higher survival percentage. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and, after six months, were cut back at the collar level. A week before cutting, mycorrhizal and not-mycorrhizal plants were treated with 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP 200 mg l- 1) to promote offshoot production. For three months after the cut, every month the offshoots of each plants were counted, harvested and weighted.

Physiological and metabolic changes triggered by {{each of the two}} distinct stimuli were determined. Environmental conditions exerted a significant effect on fruit set as showed by the higher natural drop rate recorded in the late production cycle with respect to the early cycle. Shade and GAc treatments increased the percentage of flower drop compared to the control, and at a similar degree, during the late production cycle. The reduction of leaf gas exchanges under shade conditions was not observed in GAc treated vines. The metabolic profile assessed in samples collected during the late cycle differently affected primary and secondary metabolisms and showed that most of the treatment-resulting variations occurred in opposite trends in inflorescences unbalanced in either hormonal or energy deficit abscission-inducing signals.

Wistar rats received repeated injections of stanozolol (5 mg/kg, s. c.), or vehicle (propylene glycol, 1 ml/kg) once daily for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after last injection, changes of dopamine (DA) and relative metabolite levels, homovanilic acid (HVA) and 3, 4 -dihydroxy phenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5 -HT) and its metabolite levels, 5 -hydroxy <b>indolacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (5 -HIAA), and noradrenaline (NA) amount were investigated in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), striatum (STR) and hippocampus (HIPP).

Two assays were carried out in Petri dishes with agar (0. 8 %), the first using the AMF Gigaspora margarita and the second with the AMF Scutellospora sp. The treatments were: inoculation of PSB 8; PSB 56 and uninoculated control. P-solubilizing isolates produced different amounts of IAA and most PSF isolates produced higher IAA than PSB. From the 18 th day of incubation of Scutellospora sp., a significant increase in hyphal growth in the treatment inoculated with PSB 8 was observed. In contrast, PSB 56 inhibited the hyphal growth of Gigaspora margarita from the 24 th day of incubation...|$|E
40|$|Melon is an {{important}} fruit crop, belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. Genomic tools exist for this species and plant biotechnology {{can be used to}} introduce genes and transfer novel characteristics for breeding or functional validation of ‘candidate genes’ involved in horticultural traits. However, the two major pre-requisites for genetic transformation through Agrobacterium tumefaciens are the availability of a reliable plant regeneration system and a suitable method for transformation. Previous studies showed that in vitro manipulation of melon is difficult; the regeneration efficiency is strongly influenced by both the genotype and the medium. The aim of this work was to set up a good protocol for melon plant regeneration to be used for Agrobacterium–mediated genetic transformation. Six melon genotypes, belonging to the var. cantalupensis (the doubled-haploid lines NAD, L 6, L 2 and the cvs. Isabelle, Charentais-T, Vedrantais), were employed to evaluate their morphogenetic response to different hormone concentrations. Cotyledon explants from 6 -days old seedlings were cultured on MS medium added with different combinations of benzylaminopurine (BAP) and <b>indolacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (IAA). The three media were identified as ‘A’ (BAP 1. 0 - IAA 1. 0 · 10 - 2 mg/l), ‘B’ (BAP 1. 2 - IAA 1. 2 · 10 - 2 mg/l) and ‘C’ (BAP 1. 3 - IAA 1. 3 · 10 - 2 mg/l). Each explant was scored for developing shoot buds after 30 days of culturing; the average number of shoots/explant ranked from 0. 4 (L 6) to 4. 1 (Charentais-T), from 0. 3 (L 6) to 4. 4 (Charentais-T) and from 0. 1 (L 6) to 2. 4 (Vedrantais) for the medium A, B and C, respectively. Although we obtained regenerated plants for every genotypes from all the media used, there were significant differences in the frequency of regeneration. The plant regeneration rate varied from 24 % (Charentais-T, Isabelle) to 85 % (L 6), from 20 % (L 2) to 66 % (NAD) and from 10 % (Charentais-T) to 50 % (L 6) for the medium A, B and C, respectively. Subsequently, all the genotypes were used for transformation experiments mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Different concentrations of kanamycin (Km) and geneticin (Gt) were added on regeneration medium B and compared for their efficiency as selection agents for the selection and regeneration of transgenic shoots after the infection. Preliminary histochemical GUS assay confirmed the transient incorporation of a selectable marker (nptII) into the genome of transgenic plants. The effective setting of this part of the protocol is still in progress...|$|E

The purified enzyme showed only one peak of activity on Sephadex G- 100 and PAGE revealed that the enzyme was purified by the procedures adopted. The purified enzyme showed a molecular weight of 29000 Da, maximum activity at pH 5. 0 and at 40 ºC. The calculated apparent activation energy (Ea) for the reaction was 10. 04 kcal/mol. The enzyme was heat-labile in the temperature range of 60 to 75 ºC with a fast inactivation at 75 ºC. Measurement of residual activity showed a stabilizing effect of sucrose at various temperature/sugar concentrations (0, 10, 20 %, w/w), with an activation energy (Ea) for inactivation increasing with sucrose concentration from 0 to 20 % (w/w). The Km and Vmax values were 9. 35 and 15. 38 mM for 0 -dianisidine and H 2 O 2, respectively. The bound enzyme was inhibited competitively by ferulic, caffeic and protocatechuic acids with different values of Ki,. L-cysteine, p-coumaric and <b>indolacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and Fe++ also inhibited the enzyme but at a lower grade.

30|$|As for {{the ability}} of the {{different}} fertilizers to enhance shoot dry matter production, although both RP/Trp and RP/(HA–Trp) presented very similar results to each other in soil incubation studies, HA–Trp—but not Trp alone—presented a beneficial action of the efficiency of RP to enhance shoot dry matter production when all harvests are considered (Fig.  1). In fact, even though RP/Trp caused a prompt and significant increase in shoot dry matter production at the first harvest and for the higher doses of P (30 and 50  mg kg− 1), this effect disappeared at the following harvests. Conversely, both SSP and RP/(HA–Trp) presented higher increases in shoot dry matter production than the control and RP for the second and third harvests (Fig.  1). Thus, the association of RP with (HA–Trp) caused a significant and sustained increase in shoot dry matter production compared with RP for all harvest times, with this increase being similar to that caused by SSP (Fig.  1). These results were clearer for the highest dose of P added to the soil (50  mg kg− 1) (Fig.  1). Differences between RP/Trp and RP/(HA–Trp) might be a consequence of an effect of HA on RP solubilization either directly or through an increase in soil microbial activity. However, preliminary studies using P fertilizers containing 1  % HA did not show any effect on both P bioavailability and shoot growth in several soil types [41]. In some way, these results were expected since the concentration of P applied to soil (50  mg Kg− 1) involved the soil application of very low concentrations of HA (lower than 40  mg kg− 1). However, these studies showed that when HA was applied forming stable and soluble complexes with Zn or Cu, a clear increase in plant growth was observed resulting from an improvement in the plant uptake of both micronutrients [42]. Although in our study we do not use humic metal complexes, some action of HA in RP fertilizers improving micronutrient plant nutrition cannot be ruled out. Another factor influencing the differential effect of HA–Trp compared with Trp alone might result from the presence of Fe in HA–Trp complexes. However, taking into account that the amount of plant-available Fe in Egozcue soil is quite high (Table  1), it is rather improbable that the Fe added with HA–Trp in RP/(HA–Trp) treatment can cause significant changes in plant growth. Finally, another possible explanation for these results may relate to some type of synergic action of HA and Trp when applied together. In fact, Trp complexation in HA supramolecule might delay its conversion in <b>indolacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (IAA) (and, therefore, IAA degradation) by favoring a slow release of Trp to the rhizospheric environment [23 – 25]. This hypothesis might also contribute to explain the results obtained, but further experiments using this experimental model are needed in order to establish its validity.|$|E

40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos da inoculação do feijoeiro com bactérias promotoras de crescimento de plantas. Os microrganismos foram isolados de solo próximo às raízes de feijão, em quatro tipos de solo. Um total d e 360 bactérias foi selecionado quanto à capacidade para produzir fitohormônios e de solubilizar fosfato. As bactérias selecionadas foram testadas no feijoeiro em casa de vegetação. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial (2 x 8), com três repetições e os tratamentos: feijão não inoculado e inoculado com as bactérias K 24, K 36, K 71, T 30, T 79, A 24 e T 22, isoladamente. Em todos os tratamentos o feijoeiro foi cultivado na presença e ausência de fertilização fosfatada. As bactérias K 36 e T 79 aumentaram o peso da parte aérea do feijoeiro e seu conteúdo em nitrogênio e fósforo (P), em solo com baixo teor de P disponível. Estes resultados foram obtidos mesmo com o isolado T 79 apresentando baixa capacidade de produzir ácido indolacético (AIA) e não sendo a bactéria que mais solubilizou fosfato. O K 36, por outro lado, foi o que mais produziu AIA, além de ter sido um dos que mais solubilizaram fosfato. Os resultados foram também discutidos quanto à adequabilidade das técnicas utilizadas na seleção dos isolados. Abstract: The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effects of bean plants inoculation with bacterial isolates presenting plant growth promoting characteristics. These bacteria were isolated from the soil near the bean roots grown in different types of soil. The parameters used to select these microorganisms were: ability to solubilize phosphate and the ability to produce phytohormones. The selected bacteria were tested in greenhouse. The experimental design was completely randomized, in factorial scheme (2 x 8), with three replications and the following treatments: bean not inoculated and bean inoculated with K 24, K 36, K 71, T 30, T 79, A 24 and T 22 isolates, separately. In all the above treatments beans were grown in the presence or absence of phosphate fertilization. The bacterial isolates K 36 and T 79 increased the shoot dry weights of bean plants and its phosphorus and nitrogen content in soils with low available P and were considered potential candidates for use as bio-fertilizers. These results were obtained even with the T 79 isolate having low capacity to produce <b>indolacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (AIA) and not being the bacteria with largest phosphate solubilizing capacity. The K 36 isolate, on the other hand, was the largest AIA producer, in addition to being one of the largest phosphate solubilizing. The results obtained in this work were also discussed regarding the suitability of the techniques used in the selection of PGPB. 201...|$|E
