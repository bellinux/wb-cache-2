5|$|Biographer Mellow {{believes}} that <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> is Hemingway's most experimental book, particularly with its unusual narrative form. The vignettes have no traditional sense of narrative; they {{begin in the}} middle. Shifting points-of-view and narrative perspectives disguise autobiographical details.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to younger}} writers by Anderson himself, Winesburg, Ohio {{has served as}} a {{representative}} early example of the modern short story cycle in American letters. Comparisons between Winesburg, Ohio and Jean Toomer's Cane (1923), Ernest Hemingway's <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> (1925), William Faulkner's Go Down, Moses (1942), and several of John Steinbeck's works, among others, demonstrate the pervasiveness of the formal innovations made in Anderson's book.|$|E

5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>time</b> with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E

In 1982, the film <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> (1982), which featured four young talented directors (Edward Yang, Te-Chen Tao, I-Chen Ko, and Yi Chang), began what would {{be known as the}} rejuvenation of Taiwanese cinema: the New Taiwanese Cinema.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian Antarctic {{historian}} Hans Bogen {{described her}} in 1955 as: “Ingrid Dahl {{was exactly what}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>time</b> we call a kjekk og frisk jente (a Norwegian expression meaning a girl who could be at {{once one of the}} boys, then one of the girls, without losing her femininity or charm). She was the natural leader of the girls in her age group because of her initiative, humour and fearlessness, qualities she has preserved unwaveringly to the present day”. Ingrid married Lars Christensen in 1910, uniting two of Sandefjord’s most powerful ship owning families, and they had six children.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then.

But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
