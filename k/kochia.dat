50|$|A {{study of}} <b>Kochia</b> scoparia in {{northern}} Montana by two {{high school students}} showed that when <b>Kochia</b> precedes spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), it reduces the spring wheat's growth. Effects included delayed emergence, decreased rate of growth, decreased final height and decreased average vegetative dry weight of spring wheat plants. A larger study later showed that <b>Kochia</b> seems to exhibit allelopathy on various crops in northern Montana.|$|E

40|$|This Application Note {{describes}} the HPLC separation methods that were developed for five traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) – Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii (zhe bei mu), Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (zhi mu), Sanjin Tablets, Fructus <b>Kochiae</b> (difuzi), and Fructus Liquidambaris (lulutong). The HPLC methods were optimized to give better separation for {{the maximum number}} of components. Sample preparation methods are also described, to help readers who wish to follow the entire application. for {{the maximum number of}} peaks is also helpful for use of fingerprint chro-matograms for analysis of other unknown components. An Agilent 1200 Series Rapid Resolution LC (RRLC) system was used for the separation. With this system, one can easily choose to use sub-two-micron RRLC columns or conventional HPLC columns for different analysis requirements for TCM samples. If a narrow internal diameter (id) column is used, one needs an RRLC nebulizer (Agilent part number G 4218 - 20004) for narrow peak width. The examples shown in this Application Note take separations and sample throughput into account to balance both. One can easily use another column with the same packing material but different column inner diameter and length to speed up the separation or increase the peak capacity to meet different requirements...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the birthplace}} of the {{traditional}} art form Chavittu Nadakam [...] Each year a lot of celebrations and cultural programmes took place and so the island is now known as the 'Island of Festivals'. Majority of the population are highly literate and strictly religious; and hence the {{a very large number of}} priests from this village.This place was ruled by one and the only Christian royal family in India,called Villarvattom, which means the rulers of the land protected by a bow(villu) shaped river(aaru).Villarvattam was a vassal kingdom under Kochi,at the time of Raja Thoma Villarvattam.This area was ceded to the Kingdom of <b>Kochi,as</b> the Villarvattam family did not have male children,and the female who inherited the throne was married to Paliam royal family.13 Nasrani families under the leadership of Outha Kalathil paid a huge amount of money to Kochi rulers and retained their rights on the land.The original Christian families in the island include ancient families of Kalathil, Konath,Pullayil, Parakkal, Thattakath, Arakkal, Kallungal,Manakkil,Valiyamarathingal, Pulikkathara,Puthezhath etc.Still the Christians in Gothuruth like to be called and known by their family names,and are very protective of their own unique culture and heritage.visit http://www.keralatourism.org/gothuruth-boat-race.phphttp://gothuruthboatrace.com/ ...|$|R

50|$|Halogeton is also {{destructive}} {{to the land}} of the American west because its excretion of mineral salts makes it harder for other plants to grow where it occurs. The growth of the plant is controlled by introducing certain nonnative plants, such as immigrant <b>kochia</b> (<b>Kochia</b> prostrata) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), which compete successfully with halogeton. Grazing practices are changed to assure that land is not denuded, since land which is disturbed by overgrazing is susceptible to halogeton invasion.|$|E
