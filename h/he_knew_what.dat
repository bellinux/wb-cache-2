5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he was doing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

5000|$|He {{added that}} [...] "The song 'So High' is just ridiculous. Afrojack {{is such an}} amazing producer." [...] He also commented on Afrojack, saying that [...] "Again, {{he lives in the}} clubs. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> works. So when it comes to {{actually}} producing, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what's</b> gonna have an impact in the club." ...|$|R
25|$|From {{the records}} of St. Francis' {{physical}} ailments and symptoms, Dr. Edward Frederick Hartung concluded in 1935 that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> health problems plagued St. Francis. Hartung believed {{that he had an}} eye ailment known as trachoma and quartan malaria.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{served in}} the privy council and {{was in charge of}} state secrets for a long time. He was not only a talented writer, but also a deep thinker who {{understood}} very well his place as a subject of his lord. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> his lord expected of him and adapted his behaviour accordingly to please his lord. That was why he managed to remain in Emperor Wu's favour and live a comfortable life until his death.|$|E
25|$|The battleships captain, believing Montagu was aground at Hartland Point, sent a {{party on}} a rowing boat to the north, instructing them {{to contact the}} Hartland Point Lighthouse. They instead got to the North light on Lundy Island, where {{officers}} asked the lighthouse keeper to inform the British Admiralty that they were aground south of Hartland Point. An argument ensued with the keeper over where they were until he pointed out <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> lighthouse he kept.|$|E
5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} oral {{argument}} all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on {{the nuances of}} the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the law is. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the opinion should say. And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.|$|R

25|$|In {{the next}} season, South Africa hosted India {{for their first}} ever tour. Shastri opened in all four Tests and {{struggled}} to score runs. The only bright spot was a 16 ball 27 not out, in India's one day win at Centurion park. He had batted down the order in the one day matches of this series. In reference to the World Cup innings against Australia, he commented later that for once <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> his exact role was.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> I was selling.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, Langtry met “an {{eccentric}} young bachelor, with vast estates in Scotland, a large breeding stud, {{a racing}} stable, {{and more money}} than <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do with”: he was George Alexander Baird or Squire Abington, as he came to be known. He inherited wealth from his grandfather, who with seven of his sons, had developed and prospered from coal and iron workings. Baird’s father had {{died when he was}} a young boy, leaving him a fortune in trust. In addition, he inherited the estates of two equally wealthy uncles who had died childless.|$|E
6000|$|My last inquiry {{addressed}} to the boy {{was the most important}} of all. Did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Sherwin's profession or employment was? ...|$|R

25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} guilty by reason of {{insanity}} and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he had done was wrong.|$|E
25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only {{have come from the}} SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E
25|$|De Valera {{balked at}} the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the {{negotiations}} because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the outcome would be and {{did not wish to}} receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over {{the fact that they had}} not consulted with him, their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the Dáil during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the Treaty Ports, the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.|$|E

500|$|Carey and her {{management}} {{then decided}} to release [...] "It's Like That", which Carey called [...] "the right fire-starter", as the album's lead single. She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri: [...] "I am so grateful I went to Atlanta," [...] she said. [...] "And I have to say, we wrote {{some of my favorite}} songs on the album. I'm so proud of Jermaine – he's so focused, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had to be done." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing about}} this, {{conductor}} Michael Gielen stated: [...] "When he said <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was happening at Sirius, I {{turned away from}} him in horror. I haven't listened to a note since", and called Stockhausen's statements [...] "hubris" [...] and [...] "nonsense", {{while at the same time}} defending his own belief in astrology: [...] "Why should these large celestial bodies exist if they do not stand for something? I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is much we do not understand" [...]|$|E
500|$|Braun {{continued}} to work for Hoffmann after commencing her relationship with Hitler. She took many photographs and movies {{of members of the}} inner circle, and some of these were sold to Hoffmann for extremely high prices. She received money from Hoffmann's company as late as 1943, and also held the position of private secretary to Hitler. This guise meant she could enter and leave the Chancellery unremarked, though she used a side entrance and a rear staircase. Görtemaker notes that Braun and Hitler enjoyed a normal sex life. Braun's friends and relatives described Eva giggling over a 1938 photograph of Neville Chamberlain sitting on a sofa in Hitler's Munich flat with the remark: [...] "If only <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> goings-on that sofa has seen." ...|$|E

50|$|The fame of Tokai lies in his dialogues. Sometimes {{he speaks}} like a philosopher. once asked if <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> a family is, the {{homeless}} Tokai reflects, 'I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> mine is—footpath, dustbin, the crows etc.'.|$|R
500|$|After the afternoon's initial skirmishing {{with the}} French, Kutuzov held a council {{of war on}} the evening of 10 November at Melk, at the great abbey there. He knew several things. First, he knew the {{positions}} of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured. He also knew that Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well ahead of any French reinforcements: Dupont had crossed at Passau and, by 10 November, stood at Marbach, [...] upstream, and Dumonceau was another [...] further behind Dupont. Kutuzov knew the size of the French force—its division strength—and its positions, and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north. He also knew, or had made a good supposition, about Napoleon's orders, so <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to offer Mortier and Gazan as bait.|$|E
500|$|Although Vaughan {{has written}} for television, and has {{endeavored}} to have his previous works adapted into film, he stresses that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book {{and not to be}} adapted to other media, explaining [...] "I wanted to do something that was way too expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown-up to be a four-quadrant blockbuster." [...] Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead, having written the first six issues as the first story arc, which would have ended with the two main characters dying on the rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful. By June 2016, Vaughan indicated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the last page of the series' final issue would be.|$|E
500|$|His {{relationship}} with Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was {{hidden from the}} public and all but his inner circle. Within that circle (most of whom survived the war), he was open about Braun, and they lived together at Berchtesgaden as a couple. Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, stated in his memoirs that Hitler and Braun had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with interconnecting doors at the Berghof, and Hitler would end most evenings alone with her in his study before they retired to bed. She would wear a [...] "dressing gown or house-coat" [...] and drink wine; Hitler would have tea. Braun biographer Heike Görtemaker notes that the couple enjoyed a normal sex life. Braun's friends and relatives described her giggling over a 1938 photograph of Neville Chamberlain sitting on a sofa in Hitler's Munich flat with the remark: [...] "If only <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> goings-on that sofa has seen." ...|$|E
