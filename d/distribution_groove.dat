As design guidance, leakage model of long piston cylinder during starting action stage is built. It shows influences of clearance, length of piston and other parameters on seal ability. Leakage model of another piston with two rows of small pores is introduced and studied. In those structures the number and diameter of holes as well as clearance of piston-cylinder are key factors of leakage. Based on above models and principles, {{a new type of}} air bearing piston with pores, pressure <b>distribution</b> <b>groove</b> and seal gaps is proposed and a single-acting frictionless cylinder is designed. Its pneumatic experiments have been done in a set of test system. Test results show this cylinder’s friction is near 0 and it behaves reliable performance under stable pneumatic resource...|$|E

40|$|A {{hypothesis}} that the age and <b>distribution</b> of <b>grooves</b> {{on the surface of}} Phobos may be explained by a hybrid origin due to varying tidal stresses induced after a large impact altered the satellite's rotation rate is presented. The theory that these grooves are surface manifestations of internal fractures induced by the decay of Phobos orbit is ruled out because this mechanism would require the grooves to be extremely young features, but their implied age is greater than 10 to the 9 th power yr. The location and relationship of grooves to the largest crater, Stickney, indicate that they are related to the Stickney impact, but were formed shortly after that event with orientations determined by the shape of Phobos. If the impact destroyed the condition of synchronous rotation, the changing orientation of Phobos in the gravitational field of Mars would subject its interior to stresses, producing the systems of grooves...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} {{for the formation of}} grooves on Phobos, and no single explanation is likely to account fully for the wide variety of observed groove morphologies and orientations. One set of grooves is geographically associated with the impact crater Stickney. We test the hypothesis that these grooves were formed by clasts that were ejected from the Stickney crater interior at velocities such {{that they were able to}} slide, roll, and/or bounce to distances comparable to observed groove lengths (of the order of one-quarter of the circumference of Phobos), partly crushing the regolith and partly pushing it aside as they moved. We show that this mechanism is physically possible and is consistent with the sizes, shapes, lengths, linearity, and <b>distribution</b> of Stickney-related <b>grooves</b> for plausible values of the material properties of both the regolith and the ejecta clasts. Because the escape velocity from Phobos varies by more than a factor of two over the surface of the satellite, it is possible for ejecta clasts to leave the surface again after generating grooves. We make predictions for the surface characteristics and <b>distributions</b> of such <b>grooves</b> and their deposits on the basis of this model, and then compare them with remotely sensed observations of Phobos׳ grooves. We find that many of their characteristics can be accounted for by a model in which grooves are formed by rolling and bouncing boulders ejected from Stickney. As a further test of this hypothesis, we examine a wide range of lunar boulder tracks, and find that they have considerable similarities to grooves on Phobos in terms of morphology, structure, and relationships with underlying topography. We therefore find that the emplacement of very low-velocity ejecta associated with the Stickney cratering event is a candidate mechanism for the formation of grooves on Phobos. This model and these predictions can be further tested by analysis of high-resolution image data from current and upcoming missions to this and other small airless bodies...|$|R

The SERS properties of these substrates have been studied in terms of the enhancement factor (EF), point-to-point reproducibility and sample-to-sample repeatability. It turned out that high SERS EF and good reproducibility requirements are both fulfilled. As for repeatability, remarkably better results than typical literature values have been achieved.

Contrary to some studies, subvertical grooves from adjacent facets perfectly overlap {{each other and}} do not interdigitate, probably forming small channels. Both the facet and the groove surface share the same polished appearance, suggesting a common origin.

40|$|Phobos {{parallel}} grooves {{were first}} observed on Viking images 38. {{years ago and}} since then they have been greatly debated leading to several formation hypotheses. Nevertheless, {{none of them have}} been favoured and widely accepted. In this work, we provide a different approach, assuming that Phobos grooves can be the expression of fracture planes, and deriving their spatial distribution and orientation on 3 D reconstructions, we point out that any origin related only to craters at Phobos surface should be ruled out, since the majority of the grooves is unrelated to any craters now present at its surface. This raises the intriguing possibility that such grooves, if expression of fracture planes, are remnant features of an ancient parent body from which Phobos could have originated. Such scenario has never been considered for Phobos, though this origin was already proposed for the formation of 433 Eros grooves (Buczkowski, D. L., Barnouin-Jha, O. S., Prockter, L. M. [2008]. Icarus 193, 39).

Compared to other Acanthothoraci, the new taxon exhibits a skull roof variable in its dermal plate distribution (e. g. a supernumerary plate: the posterior central plate) and sensory line pattern. Even the different specimens of this taxon show such variability between them. Arabosteus variabilis enlarges the scope of our knowledge of Acanthothoraci and Placodermi in general. Traditionally, the Arthrodira, one of the historically earliest described groups, provide the standard reference model for the placoderm skull roof pattern. The interpretation of the acanthothoracid skull roof pattern of the Saudi taxon from an arthrodiran model {{and the establishment of}} homologies is impossible to resolve unless based on prior assumptions (e. g. hypothesis of fragmentation or fusion for the paranuchal plate complex).

40|$|The {{developments}} in grating performance {{described in this}} thesis fall naturally into two parts according to whether the grating blank is plane or concave. For plane diffraction gratings, this study utilizes both experimental work and rigorous electromagnetic theories to achieve improved grating and instrument performance. The section concerned with concave gratings is entirely theoretical, drawing on the manipulation of geometric theories to design high quality gratings. Three types of plane diffraction grating grooves currently generated by holographic techniques are investigated. A discussion of methods for accurately measuring the groove profile is presented with particular reference to quasi-sinusoidal groove profiles. The spectral performance of blazed holographic gratings is shown numerically to be {{comparable to that of}} triangular groove gratings. Consideration is then given to simple optical arrangements which permit Fourier synthesis of complex <b>distributions</b> and <b>groove</b> profiles. Experimental investigations of the behaviour of resonance anomalies exhibited by gratings having surface layers of discontinuous conductivity are presented. It is demonstrated that a coating consisting of a dielectric overlaid with a metal of high conductivity drastically reduces energy absorption. A theoretical search to determine the optimum groove modulation of both blazed and sinusoidal plane reflection gratings is presented. This will assist with the development of high-gain dye lasers utilizing gratings at grazing incidence. Aberration coefficients derived using Fermat's principle are used for an examination of aberration-correction for Rowland circle spectrographs. Attention is focussed on the case where the mounting and recording points lie on the Rowland circle. Correction at two wavelengths of primary astigmatism or primary coma under this constraint is demonstrated. Alternatively, primary astigmatism and primary coma can be simultaneously corrected over a restricted wavelength range. Some practical implications are discussed. The geometric theory of concave gratings is extended to accommodate higher order aberration terms. The magnitude of the individual terms of the light path function, which describes image formation by an aberration-corrected grating, is investigated. Similarly, the behaviour of the image height under these restraints is studied for various values of the relative aperture. Finally, aberration minimization techniques are employed in the design of a uni-axial, double concave grating monochromator. The performance of this instrument is evaluated for ruled and holographic gratings...|$|R

For a generator, the rotor rotating-driven flow, usually {{referred to as the}} rotating pumping flow, {{plays an important role in}} rotor winding cooling. In this study, three-dimensional numerical analyzes are presented for turbulent pumping flow in the inter-coil rotor cavity and short cooling grooves of a generator. Calculations of the flow field and the mass flux <b>distribution</b> through the <b>grooves</b> were carried out in a sequence of four related cases Under an isothermal condition: (a) pumping flow, which is the self-generated flow resulted from the rotor pumping action; (b) mixing flow, which is the combination of the ventilating flow and pumping flow, under a constant density condition; (c) mixing flow, with density modeled by the ideal gas law; and (d) mixing flow, with different pressure differentials applied on the system. The comparisons of the results from these cases can provide useful information regarding the impacts of the ventilating flow, gas density, and system pressure differential on the mass flux distribution in the short cooling grooves. Results show that the pumping effect is strong enough to generate the cooling flow for rotor winding cooling. Therefore, for small- or mid-size generators ventilation fans may be eliminated. It also suggests that increasing the chimney dimension can improve the distribution uniformity of mass flux through the cooling grooves...|$|R

The data are conveniently stored in the ArcGIS software system, which provides an environment for mapping and which allows us to carry out joint data analysis and miscellaneous data cross-comparisons. We have compiled catalogs of Phobos craters using manual and automated techniques, which includes about 5500 and 6400 craters correspondingly. While crater numbers are biased by available image data resolution and illumination, we estimate that our catalog of manually detected craters contains all Phobos craters with diameters D> 250 m which is a total of 1072 and catalog of automated detected craters are complete for craters D> 400 m (360 craters). Statistical analysis of these large craters reveals a surplus of craters on the anti-Mars hemisphere, whereas differences in crater abundance between leading and trailing hemisphere cannot be confirmed. This in contrast to previous papers, where no such asymmetry was found (Schmedemann et al., 2014). But we cannot rule out remaining biases due to resolution, viewing angles or illumination effects. Using digital terrain model (DTM) derived from photogrammetry image processing we estimate depths of 25 craters larger than 2 km using geometric and dynamic heights (for discussion of Phobos crater morphometry see Kokhanov et al., 2014).
