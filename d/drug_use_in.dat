5|$|A {{sample for}} an out-of-competition drugs test that Chambers had {{provided}} in Germany on 1 August 2003 was re-examined in October and subsequently {{tested positive for}} banned substances. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO); the workplace of both Chambers' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. Both men faced charges of distributing illegal drugs to athletes in the United States. The BALCO Scandal uncovered <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide range of}} sportsmen and women, including sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} on <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> athletics {{in an interview}} with Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{produced}} by Tricky with assistance from Mark Saunders, who helped him utilize dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken {{from a variety of}} musical sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and experimental music. The songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, and recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> writing them, Tricky drew on his experiences in the British drug culture and the influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E

5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E

25|$|Further UK {{studies have}} shown {{slightly}} more moderate rates of substance misuse among mentally ill individuals. One study found that individuals suffering from schizophrenia showed just a 7% prevalence of problematic <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the year prior to being interviewed and 21% reported problematic use some time before that.|$|E
25|$|Duesberg {{argues that}} there is a {{statistical}} correlation between trends in recreational drug use and trends in AIDS cases. He argues that the epidemic of AIDS cases in the 1980s corresponds to a supposed epidemic of recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the United States and Europe during the same time frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> Mexico is still {{low compared to}} Canada and the United States, however with the increased role of Mexico in the trafficking and production of illicit drugs, the availability of drugs has slowly increased locally since the 1980s. In the decades before this period, consumption was not generalized – reportedly occurring mainly among persons of high socioeconomic status, intellectuals and artists.|$|E

Many psychiatric disorders include problems with impulse and other emotional control.|$|E
25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study in}} adult polydrug users in a detoxification program showed {{the efficacy of}} prasterone treatment combined with psychosocial enrichment and after-care. Prasterone administration positively affected decision-making, mood and well-being as early as one month into treatment, and had a long-lasting preventive effect on relapse to <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> a 16-month follow-up, relapse rates of prasterone-treated subjects were only 11.5%. No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.|$|E
25|$|A {{rational}} {{drug policy}} is {{one based on}} <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> which patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community. Pharmaceutical companies make considerable money by selling drugs under their trade names, promoting the branded drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribe branded drugs which are more expensive than generic drugs which have the same efficacy.|$|E

25|$|Paul Branzburg of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal, in {{the course}} of his {{reporting}} duties, witnessed people manufacturing and using hashish. He wrote two articles concerning <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky. The first featured unidentified hands holding hashish, while the second included marijuana users as sources. These sources requested not to be identified. Both of the articles were brought to attention of law-enforcement personnel. Branzburg was subpoenaed before a grand jury for both of the articles. He was ordered to name his sources.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 {{season was}} one of turmoil. Starting quarterback Quincy Carter was {{terminated}} for alleged <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> favor of 40-year-old veteran Vinny Testaverde, who {{had been brought to}} the Cowboys from the New York Jets by his former coach in the off-season. While a favorite of Coach Parcells, Testaverde proved ineffective as a starter. The Cowboys started strong, with victories against the Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins, but injuries, older personnel, spotty play calling, and persistent penalties hobbled the Cowboys, and they quickly fell off to a 3–5 record by midseason, finishing the season 6–10.|$|E
25|$|KQED was co-producer of the {{television}} adaptation of Armistead Maupin's novel, Tales of the City, which aired on PBS stations nationwide in January 1994. The original six-part series was produced by Britain's public-service Channel 4 Corporation with KQED and PBS' American Playhouse. The six-part miniseries featured gay themes, nudity and illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> this fictional portrayal of life in 1970s San Francisco. Although the program gave PBS its highest ratings ever for a dramatic program, PBS bowed to threats of federal funding cuts and announced it would not participate in {{the television}} production of an adaptation of the second book in the series, More Tales of the City. The film division of KQED was founded by Irving Saraf.|$|E

25|$|Extensive {{personality}} {{research has}} been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences in risky behaviour. The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage in risky behaviour under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E
25|$|The band's second studio album, Antichrist Superstar, was {{released}} on October 8, 1996. It was recorded at Nothing Studios with Reznor, Manson, Sean Beavan and former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie sharing co-production duties; members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails took part in its recording. The process of making the album was a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation and near-constant <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> <b>in</b> an {{effort to create a}} violent and hostile environment suited to the album's content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high. Daisy Berkowitz, the band's founding guitarist, departed the band partway through the album's recording process, with Twiggy performing much of the album's guitar work. Timothy Linton responded to an advert seeking Berkowitz' replacement. He would form a close relationship with Madonna Wayne Gacy, who was responsible for the inclusion of one of the major sources of inspiration for the album: Kabbalah. Breaking with the six-year tradition of naming band members after female icons and serial killers, Zim Zum was chosen as Linton's stage name. It was derived from the Lurianic Kabbalah concept of Tzimtzum.|$|E
