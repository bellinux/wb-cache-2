40|$|Abstract—The {{theory of}} {{compressed}} sensing suggests that successful inversion {{of an image}} of the physical world (e. g., a radar/sonar return or a sensor array snapshot vector) for the source modes and amplitudes can be achieved at measurement dimensions far lower than what might be expected from the classical theories of spectrum or modal analysis, provided that the image is sparse in an apriori known basis. For imaging problems in passive and active radar and sonar, this basis is usually taken to be a DFT basis. The compressed sensing measurements are then inverted using an ℓ 1 -minimization principle (basis pursuit) for the nonzero source amplitudes. This seems to make compressed sensing an ideal <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> principle for high resolution modal analysis. However, in reality no physical field is sparse in the DFT basis or in an apriori known basis. In fact the main goal in <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> is to identify the modal structure. No matter how finely we grid the parameter space the sources may not lie {{in the center of the}} grid cells and there is always mismatch between the assumed and the actual bases for sparsity. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of basis pursuit to mismatch between the assumed and the actual sparsity bases and compare the performance of basis pursuit with that of classical <b>image</b> <b>inversion.</b> Our mathematical analysis and numerical examples show that the performance of basis pursuit degrades considerably in the presence of mismatch, and they suggest that the use of compressed sensing as a modal analysis principle requires more consideration and refinement, at least for the problem sizes common to radar/sonar.

40|$|A novel {{interferometric}} method - SLIVER (Super Localization by <b>Image</b> <b>inVERsion</b> interferometry) - {{is proposed}} for estimating {{the separation of}} two incoherent point sources with a mean squared error that does not deteriorate as the sources are brought closer. The essential component of the interferometer is an <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> device that inverts {{the field in the}} transverse plane about the optical axis, assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources. The performance of the device is analyzed using the Cramér-Rao bound applied to the statistics of spatially-unresolved photon counting using photon number-resolving and on-off detectors. The analysis is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation, demonstrating the superlocalization effect for separations well below that set by the Rayleigh criterion. Simulations indicating the robustness of SLIVER to mismatch between the optical axis and the centroid are also presented. The results are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric point-spread function.

40|$|Introduction People {{tend to be}} {{surprisingly}} poor at detecting {{changes in}} visual images of real-life situations. Such change blindness suggests a limitation to the human capacity to encode and compare visual information from one moment to the next, especially in images fol-lowing a large transient or flicker. We therefore used the natural indoor scenes of the change blindness database by Sareen and colleagues (2015), containing the size and on-screen location information of all changes in the images, within a flicker task paradigm. Method In this task an original and a modified real-world scene, separated by a grey blank, al-ternated repeatedly until observers detected the location (left or right side) of the im-plemented change. The stimuli were either presented upright or inverted. The goal {{of the study was}} twofold: (1) using change size and location as predictor of participant performance and (2) identifying the influence of <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> in change detection. Results A random intercepts (logistic) regressions analysis for RT and accuracy revealed three significant main effects: (1) <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> (upside-down worse and slower than nor-mal image presentation), (2) object size (larger objects easier and faster than smaller ones) and (3) location (peripheral changes easier and faster than central ones). Discussion Change size and location {{had a profound impact on}} search performance. This might relate to the overall saliency of the induced change and the search strategy of the partic-ipants. Performance was also influenced by scene inversion, possibly due to a less meaning-driven endogenous search strategy when scenes were presented upside-down. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{inversion}} {{method for}} reconstructing the precipitating electron energy flux from {{a set of}} multi-wavelength digital all-sky camera (ASC) images has recently been developed by tomografia. Preliminary tests suggested that the inversion is able to reconstruct the position and energy characteristics of the aurora with reasonable accuracy. This study carries out a thorough testing of the method and a few improvements for its emission physics equations. We compared the precipitating electron energy fluxes as estimated by the inversion method to the energy flux data recorded by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites during four passes over auroral structures. When the aurorae appear {{very close to the}} local zenith, the fluxes inverted from the blue (427. 8 nm) filtered ASC images or blue and green line (557. 7 nm) images together give the best agreement with the measured flux values. The fluxes inverted from green line images alone are clearly larger than the measured ones. Closer to the horizon the quality of the inversion results from blue images deteriorate {{to the level of the}} ones from green images. In addition to the satellite data, the precipitating electron energy fluxes were estimated from the electron density measurements by the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR). These energy flux values were compared to the ones of the inversion method applied to over 100 ASC images recorded at the nearby ASC station in Longyearbyen. The energy fluxes deduced from these two types of data are in general of the same order of magnitude. In 35 % of all of the blue and green <b>image</b> <b>inversions</b> the relative errors were less than 50 % and in 90 % of the blue and green <b>image</b> <b>inversions</b> less than 100 %. This kind of systematic testing of the inversion method is the first step toward using all-sky camera images in the way in which global UV images have recently been used to estimate the energy fluxes. The advantages of ASCs, compared to the space-born imagers, are their low cost, good spatial resolution and the possibility of continuous, long-term monitoring of the auroral oval from a fixed position...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} gated single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial perfusion images for determination of left ventricular ejection fraction. Background. Gated SPECT has expanded the applications of myocardial perfusion imaging to include the evaluation of left ventricular size, regional wall motion and regional systolic thickening. Accurate automated or semi-automated methods for quantitation of left ventricular ejection fraction from tomographic perfusion images would provide additional valuable clinical information. Methods. Rest gated SPECT {{was performed on the}} stress distribution of technetium- 99 m sestamibi, using eight frames per cardiac cycle. Mid-horizontal long-axis and vertical long-axis gated tomographic perfusion images were analyzed after digital matrix inversion, which enhances edge detection, for ejection fraction determination. These ejection fractions were compared with those determined by contrast ventriculography (n = 54, including 45 biplane and 9 single plane) and first-pass radionuclide angiography (n = 38) in patients with coronary artery disease. Results. Myocardial perfusion SPECT image inversion-derived ejection fractions were slightly lower (2. 7 ejection fraction units, p < 0. 01), and first-pass ejection fractions were much lower (8. 0 ejection fraction units, p < 0. 001) than those obtained with contrast ventriculography. There was excellent correlation between SPECT and contrast ventriculographic ejection fractions (r = 0. 93) over a wide range of ejection fractions (14 % to 89 %). Good correlation was also observed between first-pass radionuclide angiography and both contrast ventriculography (r = 0. 83) and SPECT (r = 0. 87). Reproducibility of SPECT <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> ejection fractions was excellent (intraobserver r = 0. 99, interobserver r = 0. 93). Conclusions. Semiautomated ejection fractions can be obtained from gated SPECT technetium- 99 m sestamibi perfusion images using the <b>image</b> <b>inversion</b> technique.
