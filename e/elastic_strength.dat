The cementitious material is a mixture of OPC and SDT. The percentage of OPC replacement by SDT varied from 0 %- 25 %. The distribution of grains of sand and crushed stone are designed according to SNI 03 - 2384 - 2000 : gradation zone 2 for fine aggregate and gradation with a maximum diameter of 20 mm for coarse aggregate. The tests of compressive <b>strength,</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus, tensile <b>strength</b> and permeability on the cylindrical specimens were realized at 28 and 56 days.

Accurate prediction of the material properties of stainless steel at elevated temperatures is necessary for determining the load-carrying capacity of structures under fire conditions. However, full utilization of the special feature of stainless steel has not been possible {{due to lack of}} technique data on the fire resistance of stainless steel structural material. Therefore, both steady and transient tensile coupon tests were conducted at different temperatures ranging from approximately 20 to 1000 °C to obtained the material properties of stainless steel types EN 1. 4462 (Duplex) and EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) with plate thickness of 2. 0 mm. The <b>elastic</b> modulus, yield <b>strength</b> obtained at different strain levels, ultimate strength, ultimate strain and thermal elongation versus different temperatures are also plotted and compared with the prediction from the Australian, British and European standards.

High <b>elastic</b> <b>strength</b> steel sheets are used for components that are subjected to particularly high levels of stress, such as the front structural member supports or the sub frame.

50|$|Overtopping or {{overflow}} of an {{embankment dam}} beyond its spillway capacity will cause its eventual failure. The {{erosion of the}} dam's material by overtopping runoff will remove masses of material whose weight holds the dam in place and against the hydraulic forces acting to move the dam. Even a small sustained overtopping flow can remove {{thousands of tons of}} overburden soil from the mass of the dam within hours. The removal of this mass unbalances the forces that stabilize the dam against its reservoir as the mass of water still impounded behind the dam presses against the lightened mass of the embankment, made lighter by surface erosion. As the mass of the dam erodes, the force exerted by the reservoir begins to move the entire structure. The embankment, having almost no <b>elastic</b> <b>strength,</b> would begin to break into separate pieces, allowing the impounded reservoir water to flow between them, eroding and removing even more material as it passes through. In the final stages of failure the remaining pieces of the embankment would offer almost no resistance to the flow of the water and continue to fracture into smaller and smaller sections of earth or rock until these would disintegrates into a thick mud soup of earth, rocks and water.|$|E

Manufactured sand is broken by rocks or tailings, {{which could be used}} in the mixture of cement concrete as fine aggregate instead of natural sand.

The fact that the lamellipodium of a cell is very thin (1 kPa) on thin samples. We present the method for an atomic force microscopy-based microrheology that allows us to fully quantify the viscoelastic constants (elastic storage modulus, viscous loss modulus, and the Poisson ratio) of thin areas of a cell (< 1000 nm) as well as those of thick areas. We account for substrate effects by applying two different models—a model for well-adhered regions (Chen model) and a model for nonadhered regions (Tu model). This method also provides detailed information about the adhered regions of a cell. The very thin regions relatively near the edge of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts can be identified by the Chen model as strongly adherent with an <b>elastic</b> <b>strength</b> of ∼ 1. 6 ± 0. 2 kPa and with an experimentally determined Poisson ratio of ∼ 0. 4 to 0. 5. Further from the edge of these cells, the adherence decreases, and the Tu model is effective in evaluating its <b>elastic</b> <b>strength</b> (∼ 0. 6 ± 0. 1 kPa). Thus, our AFM-based microrheology allows us to correlate two key parameters of cell motility by relating <b>elastic</b> <b>strength</b> and the Poisson ratio to the adhesive state of a cell. This frequency-dependent measurement allows for the decomposition of the elastic modulus into loss and storage modulus. Applying this decomposition and Tu's and Chen's finite depth models allow us to obtain viscoelastic signatures in a frequency range from 50 to 300 Hz, showing a rubber plateau-like behavior. ...|$|E
