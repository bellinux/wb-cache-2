5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, and <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> two species were {{roughly the same}} size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge is {{especially}} {{noted for its}} historical links with Ireland.

5|$|<b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number}} of occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Sheshi is {{mentioned}} in the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC {{during the reign of}} Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> Aegyptiaca only reports Hellenized names for Egyptian pharaohs and the identification of Sheshi with any particular name remains controversial.|$|E

5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

5|$|According to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the {{magazine}} predicted that by 2010, Woods would pass one {{billion dollars in}} earnings. In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars (before taxes) in his career, after accounting for the $10million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600million, making him the second richest person {{of color in the}} United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> Iliad itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Confusion among Jordanians was as {{important}} as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to retreat to Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured.

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} more than 1,000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2,000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Plutarch {{suggests}} that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle, having previously been seen as invincible. In the Roman period, the 'Lion of Chaeronea', an enigmatic monument {{on the site of}} the battle, was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band. Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument; it is therefore generally accepted that this was <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> grave of the Sacred Band, since it is unlikely that every member was killed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Patience, Carte {{built the}} large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's {{permanent}} home.

5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; <b>indeed,</b> <b>the</b> cuisine {{of modern}} Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients.

Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
