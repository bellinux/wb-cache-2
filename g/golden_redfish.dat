50|$|The rose fish (Sebastes norvegicus), {{also known}} as the ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, Norway haddock, red perch, red bream, <b>golden</b> <b>redfish,</b> or hemdurgan, is a deep sea species of {{rockfish}} from the North Atlantic. It is a large, slow-growing, late-maturing fish and the subject of a fishery.|$|E
50|$|The {{deepwater}} redfish (Sebastes mentella), {{also known as}} the beaked redfish, ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, Norway haddock, red perch, <b>golden</b> <b>redfish,</b> or hemdurgan, may reach a size of 55 - 70 cm, but is usually less than 45 cm. It lives in comparatively high concentrations in the North Atlantic, for example in the Irminger Sea where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between 300 and 1000 m and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the {{deepwater redfish}} has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} redfish of {{commercial}} interest occur off West Greenland inshore and offshore, <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus L.) and deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella Travin). SSB and recruitment indices for <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> decreased drastically from 1982 and have remained significantly below the average level since 1989. Taking {{into account the}} recent very low SSB and the recruitment failure together with the absence of <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> in the Greenland surveys, the stock of <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> in Subarea 1 {{is considered to be}} severely depleted with no signs of recovery. The deep-sea redfish SSB has been extremely low since 1989. The deep-sea redfish show high variation in recruitment. Good recruitment has been seen in 1997, 2000 and 2001, while the recruitment in 2002 again was very poor. Substantial numbers of redfish are discarded in the shrimp fishery, and concern must be expressed about the continuing failure of the juveniles to rebuild the pre-mature and mature stock components. From Oct. 1 2000, sorting grids have been mandatory in the shrimp fishery and this will hopefully reduce the amount of juvenile redfish in the by-catch significantly. Considering the depleted SSBs, the recruitment potential of the very abundant early life stages at an age of 0 - 2 years to the Subarea 1 stocks remains unclear. 1...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{the severe}} {{decline of the}} fishery off Greenland is being {{discussed}} controversially. In contrast to overfishing, climate changes and emigration are itemized causal. Available German data on commercial catches and research cruises are presented for clarification. A few years after the beginning of heavy exploitation during the early sixties, the stocks of cod, <b>golden</b> and beaked <b>redfish</b> reflected a significant rejuvenescence based on catch analysis. Regular scientific surveys• for stock assessment purposes commenced in 1982 when the productivity of the stocks was already adversely affected due to low spawning stocks and extremely irregular recruitment. From this point of view, {{the results of the}} latest survey in 1995 showing stagnant fish biomass at record low level since 1991 are not surprising. The status of the cod stock is still considered severely depleted. Taking the high abundance of juvenile redfish into account, recovery of the groundfish stocks is unlikely in short term and depends on the non-predictable recruitment only...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on {{distribution and}} biology of Sebastes marinus, S. mentella and S. fasciatus from fishing catches on the Flemish Cap in 2005. Biological {{data were collected}} by the observers being aboard Russian fishing vessels in October-November 2005. Fishing was executed at 200 - 400 m depths. Fishing gears were bottom trawls with the mesh size of not less than 130 mm. According to the preliminary dat a, in 2005, on the Flemish Cap, the catch of redfish species by Russian vessels was equal to 1 016 tons. <b>Golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (S. marinus) prevailed (more than 50 %) in catch. The results of bathymetric distribution researches showed that, at 200 - 299 m depths, S. marinus made {{up the bulk of}} catches. With the increase in fishing depth the portion of beaked redfish species (S. mentella and S. fasciatus) which amounted to 95. 6 % at 400 - 499 m depths rose. In according to the results from the trawl surveys by EU, mean long-term biomass of S. marinus equaled to 20 % of the total redfish stock. Increase or decrease in the total stock of redfish species was mainly connect ed with <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> stock growth and reduction. At present, on the Flemish Cap the overall stock size is estimated and recommendations for their exploitation are developed based on fishing and biological dat a on two speci es – S. mentella and S. fasciatus. To obtain more comprehensive and correct data on redfish stock, <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> S. marinus should be included into the calculations...|$|E
40|$|Assessments on NE-arctic {{stocks of}} cod, haddock, saith, redfish and Greenland halibut {{were carried out}} by the ICES 'Arctic Fisheries Working Group' in August 1996. Whereas stocks of cod, haddock, and saithe are {{presently}} in fairly good and stable condition the assessments show the stocks of beaked redfish and Greenland hailibut to be just the opposite. The status of the <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> stock seems to be stable. More detailed information is given in this report...|$|E
40|$|Data were {{obtained}} from 682 demersal trawls made between 126 and 738 m depths on Flemish Cap in summer during the European Union research surveys in the years 1989 – 94. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of different deep distributions of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna are zoned with depth. Three faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity and dominant species were found on the shelf (126 – 300 m), upper continental slope (300 – 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates were greatest on the shelf and upper continental slope, while diversity was greatest on the middle continental slope. Domi-nance of the commercial species Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the shelf, beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and Labrador redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) on upper continental slope, and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) on the middle continental slope. This showed an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be under-stood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure. On the size-depth correlations, only longnose eel (Synaphobranchus kaupy), longfin hake (Urophycis chestery), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella), <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) showed a significant 'bigger-deeper ' relationship (i. e. larger fish in deeper strata), while spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) showed a negative 'smaller-deeper ' relationship...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of trawl selectivity studies {{for the three}} redfish species of particular commercial importance in North Atlantic fisheries: Sebastes marinus, Sebastes mentella and Sebastes fasciatus, are based on data collected from diamond mesh codends with mesh sizes ranging from 88 mm to 147 mm. We demonstrate how results from these studies can be understood by morphological characteristics of the species. We predict codend size selection based on morphological data collected from <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (S. marinus) individuals. Further, consistent with previously reported morphological similarities between the three redfish species, we show the predictions for S. marinus may successfully be extrapolated to understand experimental codend size selectivity results reported for S. mentella and S. fasciatus. In addition to the comparison with previously reported data, we present new experimental results for a codend applied in Northeast Atlantic redfish trawl fishery...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of redfish has {{traditionally}} {{suffered from the}} inability to age the fish. For <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> in Icelandic waters, length distributions and abundance indices are available both from commercial catch and from surveys, particularly a groundfish survey in March. This paper addresses {{the use of an}} age- and length-based cohort model for the assessment of redfish, where all selection curves depend on the length of the fish and information on age is not a prerequisite but can be utilised if available. In the last few years it appears that ageing of this species has been successful and in this paper we compare assessment results of a model that incorporates age information with those that do not. Finally, we calculate yield per recruit, Fmax and F 0. 1 for the stock. Stock size, catch and fishing mortality are then simulated 10 years ahead using different catch control laws...|$|E
40|$|In this work, I {{investigated}} genetic {{complexity in}} four commercially exploited species from the North Atlantic: saithe (Pollachius virens L.), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and beaked and <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella and S. norvegicus). The results were used 1) {{to assess the}} consistency between current management units and units identified by results based on genetic data for each species, and 2) to assess the efficiency of SNP data compared to conventional markers in studying population genomics. Panels of nuclear genomic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites, derived from modern genomic approaches, and data on species life history traits, were analyzed to explore genetic complexity within these highly migratory and continuously distributed species. The investigation reveals biologically distinct populations within each of these species. Four genetic clusters of saithe and two clusters of Greenland halibut {{were found in the}} North Atlantic. For beaked redfish, results using both the genome-wide SNP and microsatellite data supported one group (‘shallow’) throughout the North Atlantic and a second group (‘deep’) in the central North Atlantic and Canadian waters. A localized group (‘slope’) of beaked redfish was identified in Greenland and Icelandic waters. Microsatellite DNA supported three unrecognized cryptic species of <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> in Greenland and nearby waters. Genetic isolation in golden and beaked redfish was greater than in saithe and Greenland halibut, which is possibly associated with unique life history features of redfishes. The results indicate a correlation between genetic differentiation and life history differences in the studied species. These findings imply that distinct genetic heterogeneity can exist in different marine species and may be influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors. The results highlight that in most cases the current management units of these species are comprised of multiple biological populations. The new definition of gene pools may serve to define biologically meaningful management units to ensure their sustainable exploitation and preserve evolutionary legacies. This study provides the first SNP-based population genomic investigation in saithe, Greenland halibut and beaked redfish. Comparative analyses of SNP and conventional marker systems demonstrate a higher resolution for SNP markers. Results from genome-wide SNP data identified the three genetic groups of beaked redfish from a much smaller sample set, and the estimated genetic differentiation was much greater than that found by other marker. Both in beaked redfish and Greenland halibut a sub-set of outlier SNPs were identified, implying possible signals of selection in these loci or nearby genomic sites. These outliers may provide increased power in population assignment of the species. The present work illustrates outstanding opportunities of SNP marker system for investigating population genomics of non-model organisms...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} EU project on redfish, otolith shape {{analysis}} and otolith trace element assays were conducted to test for differences between distribution areas. Otolith morphometry and shape (Fourier) descriptors were compared between sampling areas of <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus) and deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the North Atlantic. A first series of trace element assays was performed using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) on cross-sections of S. mentella otoliths. Geographical separation by these methods appeared to be weak, although some distinction of western, central and eastern areas was apparent for otolith shapes of S. marinus. Trace element concentrations in S. mentella otoliths differed between three otolith zones (core, 3 -year annulus and edge), giving first hints to physiological effects and/or migration. Differences in elemental concentrations between areas showed repeated patterns for some elements, indicating area-specific signatures. Multivariate analysis of these signatures, however, revealed no clear discrimination of distribution areas. Since the otolith shape analysis was limited to material from medium-sized fish (30 - 40 cm total length) and microchemical assays were only performed on a sub-set of S. mentella otoliths, further investigations will be carried out during the next months to reveal more information on possible natural markers for redfish...|$|E
40|$|Morphometric {{characters}} were investigated to provide criteria, {{in addition to}} morphological differences that are presently employed, for species identification of Atlantic redfishes (genus Sebastes). The study involved the analysis of morphometric data for a sample of redfish which was collected in the Labrador-Newfoundland region in 1958 and initially separated into two groups (Sebastes marinus and beaked redfish) {{on the basis of}} color, eye size and beak shape. Standard length was used as a covariate to adjust the morphometric data because S. marinus were on the average largerthan beaked redfishes. Discriminant analyses of (a) 17 morphomet-ric characters resulted in an 11 -variable discriminant function where 65 % of the variability was explained by the groups, (b) the two traditional discriminatiors (length of symphyseal tubercle and width of orbit) resulted in a function where 56 % of the variability was explained by the groups, and (c) the remaining 15 morphometric characters resulted in a 9 -variable function where 58 % of the variability was explained by the groups. The results demonstrated good (87 - 90 %) separation of <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (S. marinus) and beaked redfishes (S. mentella and S. fasciatus). Length of symphyseal tubercle (beak), orbit width, body depth at the position of the pectoral fins, interorbital width, depth of caudal peduncle, and width of pectoral fin base were determined as good morphometric discriminators...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
40|$|The 3 M redfish {{assessment}} {{is focused on}} the beaked redfish, regarded as a management unit composed of two populations from two very similar species: the Flemish Cap S. mentella and S. fasciatus. The reason for this approach is the historical dominance of this group in the 3 M redfish commercial catch until 2005. However a new <b>golden</b> <b>redfish</b> fishery (S. marinus) started on September 2005 on shallower depths of the Flemish Cap bank above 300 m, and the Flemish Cap cod fishery reopened in 2010.

Continuing pressure over Flemish Cap redfish stocks by cod predation, at levels higher, or much higher, than the levels prior to 2006 lead to higher natural mortalities since then. Natural mortality have been tuned to survey at age data 2006 onwards by the sensitivity analysis preceding each assessment, and on 2013 - 2104 has a best estimate at slightly higher level from previous years.

The sequence of negative-positive regions on the log q’s residuals that mark the 1989 - 2000 interval lead the authors to consider an alternate XSA framework: the 1989 - 2008 EU survey series was sliced into “three consecutive surveys ” (EU survey I, 1989 - 1993; EU survey II, 1994 - 2000; and EU survey III, 2001 - 2008) corresponding to the three regions of the log q’s matrix of residuals. This option resulted on improved catchability diagnostics but with a worst XSA performance in terms of retrospective bias, correlation with the tuning survey and convergence.

An Extended Survivor Analysis (Shepherd, 1999) was used with the same framework of previous assessments and with the tuning of the 1989 - 2012 EU survey. Survey results suggest that the beaked redfish stock {{has not been able to}} hold its growth and sustain an above average level, suffering instead a severe decline on the second half of the 2000 ’s. The most likely hypothesis to justify this unexpected downward trend on stock size is an increase in natural mortality by cod predation. From the sensitive analysis, natural mortality at 0. 4 was applied on ages 4 - 6 through 2006 - 2010, and extended to ages 7 plus on 2009 and 2010. It has been kept constant through all ages on 2011 and 2012, but with an overall decline to 0. 125. This is the highest possible level of natural mortality giving assessment results in line with the recent survey trends and at the same time with key diagnostics very close to the best ones, obtained with the return on 2011 - 2012 to the “standard” redfish natural mortality of 0. 1. A 2013 - 2009 retrospective XSA was also carried out, being this assessment very much in line with their immediate predecessors (2012 - 2011). Above average year classes coupled with low fishing mortalities allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance since 2003 that pushed the stock to a 2008 - 2009 high. Between 2009 and 2011 biomass and abundance of exploitable and 7 plus female stock went down for causes other than fishing. These declines were halted at well above average levels on the terminal year and, at least for biomass, there was some improvement on 2012. The recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was kept at a high level until 2009, with 2005 year class as the most abundant year class of the assessment interval. Recruitment to exploitable stock declined since then and is approaching the level of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s. Short and medium term stochastic projections were obtained for female spawning stock biomass (SSB) under Fstatusquo, together with SSB and yield medium term probability profiles. As it was documented on the 2011 assessment F 0. 1 is an unacceptable management option at the current beaked redfish stock status. Keeping on 2014 and 2015 fishing mortality at its present low level will sustain on the short term a high level of female spawning biomass. But on the long term it will be natural mortality to determine the future of beaked redfish as a fishery resource...|$|E

Continuing pressure over Flemish Cap redfish stocks by cod predation, at levels higher, or much higher, than the levels prior to 2006 lead to higher natural mortalities since then. In order to include an independent approach to natural mortality in the sensitivity M framework, for the more recent years (2011 - 2016) natural mortality has been estimated from a number of different biological models, some size/age-independent and others size/age-dependent. These different estimates were arranged in two sets and tuned to survey at age data. A natural mortality of 0. 1 on 2015 - 2016 and the natural mortalities adjusted on previous assessments were found to be the most suitable option to M input. A 2017 - 2013 retrospective XSA was performed, confirming the consistency of the present with preceding results as regards stock biomass, female spawning biomass and fishing mortality. sciatus) redfish catches. Above average year classes and high survival rates allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance 2003 onwards, pulling the stock to a 2008 - 2010 high. Since 2009 abundance went down for causes other than fishing, being still above the 1990 ’s low in 2016. By the turn of the decade stock biomass and female spawning biomass (SSB) shown marginal declines as well, but reversed on 2011 - 2012. Individual growth of survivors and low fishing mortalities sustained stock biomass and SSB at high levels till 2015 - 2016. Recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was maintained at a maximum level till 2009. Recruitment declined since then and is kept on 2015 - 2016 at the low of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s, while SSB is still well above the size that originated the high 2002 - 2006 recruitments. Despite the significant decline so far natural mortality has not flattened yet. If natural mortality and fishing mortality stay at their most recent levels, the actual high of female spawning biomass can hold on 2018 - 2019. But on the long term it will be natural mortality, namely over pre recruited ages, to determine the future of beaked redfish as a fishery resource. On 2015 STACFIS remind that projections are based in the assumption that natural mortality stay at its most recent level on the present year and at least on the two next coming years. And that, taking into account the uncertainty on the present and future level of natural mortality, its impact on female spawning stock biomass at the end of any projection is unknown. On 2017 these constraints are still in place, and therefore short and medium term projections are not presented. Versión del edito...|$|E
