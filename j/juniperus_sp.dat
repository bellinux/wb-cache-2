40|$|The Mediterranean basin is {{recognized}} as a global biodiversity hotspot accounting for more than 25, 000 plant species that represent almost 10 % of the world’s vascular flora. In particular, the maquis vegetation on Mediterranean islands and archipelagos constitutes an important resource of the Mediterranean plant diversity due to its high rate of endemism. Since 2009, a severe and widespread dieback and mortality of Quercus ilex trees and several other plant species of the Mediterranean maquis has been observed in the National Park of La Maddalena archipelago (northeast Sardinia, Italy). Infected plants showed severe decline symptoms and a significant reduction of natural regeneration. First studies revealed {{the involvement of the}} highly invasive wide-host range pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi and several fungal pathogens. Subsequent detailed research led {{to a better understanding of}} these epidemics showing that multiple Phytophthora spp. were involved, some of them unknown to science. In total, nine Phytophthora species were isolated from rhizosphere soil samples collected from around symptomatic trees and shrubs including Asparagus albus, Cistus <b>sp.,</b> <b>Juniperus</b> phoenicea, J. oxycedrus, Pistacia lentiscus and Rhamnus alaternus. Based on morphological characters, growth-temperature relations and sequence analysis of the ITS and cox 1 gene regions, the isolates were identified as Phytophthora asparagi, P. bilorbang, P. cinnamomi, P. cryptogea, P. gonapodyides, P. melonis, P. syringae and two new Clade 6 taxa which are here described as P. crassamura sp. nov. and P. ornamentata sp. nov.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} issues of {{conservation}} threats to the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), specifically regarding foraging resources and anthropogenic activities i. e. livestock grazing. I studied the diet components of red panda during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons of this herbivorous carnivore. I evaluated the diet of red panda through micro-histological study of fecal matters to determine the composition of diets. The {{results indicated that the}} red panda feeds primarily on bamboo (Thamnocalamus sp.) species, which comprised 90. 6 % and 77. 8 % of the volume of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon scats respectively, followed by minute consumption of Abis spectabilis, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus semecarpifolia, Betula utilis, Tsuga dumosa, Acer acuminatum and Texus wallichiana. Seasonal fruits of Aconogonum <b>sp.,</b> <b>Juniperus</b> indica, Sorbus cuspidata and mushrooms were found only in the post-monsoon season and comprised 13. 8 % of the volume of scats. This result indicated that the red panda is a bamboo specialist, explaining why it selects forest habitat with bamboo-dominated understory. I conducted a literature review to determine the degree to which bamboo {{was a part of the}} species’ diet throughout its range. I found that different species of bamboo were always of major importance, which suggests that factors negatively affecting the availability of bamboo can be an important threat for the species. Such factors include livestock grazing and other human-related factors and potentially bamboo die-off after mass flowering, as found with giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the mid- 1970 s. Based on this, I investigated the effects of illegal grazing inside Rara National Park on the occurrence of red pandas. I found that livestock grazing had a small but significant adverse effect on red panda presence and that bamboo availability within a certain elevational range with water sources determined red panda occurrence. 2014 - 12 - 1...|$|R

Some of the tenuipalpids, such as Pentamerismus sp., have been found on coniferous host plants and forest trees such as <b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.</b> and Thuja sp. Tenuipalpids puncture the epidermis of the host plants and suck out the juices with their needle-shaped mouth parts. Their damage causes leaves to turn brown and finally to wilt and die. This damage resembles that caused by spider mites. Although taxonomic characters are extensively used for the identification of tenuipalpids, their ultrastructure is not sufficiently well studied. False spider mite species were surveyed in recreational areas in Ankara, Turkey in 2008 and 2009.

The archaeobotanical studies highlighted the presence of various botanical taxa preserved by charring. The great diversity in founding taxa and the selective use of wood can be either due to a choice or selection or even to an environmental availability. Stable carbon isotope analysis was carried out to disentangle the human choice and climate variation. In fact, 813 C values of both fresh and charred wood are environmental proxies and are related to drought stress. Analysis of selected fossil woods (deciduous Quercus and <b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.)</b> and caryopsis (Triticum dicoccon and Hordeum vulgare) from the archaeological site were carried out.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{classify}} Envisat MERIS and Landsat ETM satellite sensor imagery using fuzzy classification techniques such as, linear mixture modelling and artificial neural networks. The images were classified successfully using these two techniques. The fuzzy results were more accurate then hard classification. Landsat ETM imagery was classified using maximum likelihood classifier and the output was resampled to 300 m to produce test data. Land cover classes comprised agriculture, bare ground, Tukish pine (Pinus brutia), Crimean pine (Pinus nigra), Lebanese cedar (Cedrus libani), Taurus fir (Abies sp.), Juniper (<b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.)</b> and water. The classification accuracy was poor as there was insufficient number of training pixels available for these classes. As a result of this, overall accuracy was considered to evaluate the potential of these techniques. Overall results of soft classification from linear mixture modeling and artificial neural network and hard classification were 80 %, 78 % and 57 % respectively. It can be concluded that soft classifiers particularly ANN for classifying Mediterranean type forest cover has a great potential.

40|$|Samples of charred wood, {{collected}} during the excavation of the West House in Akrotiri, Santorini, were analysed and identified. Olive (Olea europaea) dominated the samples, especially inside the West House, suggesting regular pruning of olive trees {{and use of the}} branches as firewood. The findings included sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), almond (Prunus dulcis), alder (Alnus sp.), pear (Pyrus amygdaliformis), terebinth or mastic tree (Pistacia sp.), juniper (<b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.),</b> pine (Pinus sp.) and tamarisk (Tamarix sp.). Castanea and Alnus were not known before from Bronze Age Santorini. The find of Castanea is the earliest registered find of wood of Castanea in Greece. Also it is shown that domesticated almond trees grew on the island itself and already were cultivated as early as the Middle Cycladic period. The range of species in pre-eruption Santorini reflects intensive human habitation. The inhabitants of Akrotiri tended orchards of olive (Olea europaea) and other fruit trees. The environment had a typical Mediterranean maquis vegetation, the result of years of cattle grazing.

We show that plants and animals at lower trophic levels are relatively poor indicators of the temporal trend in atmospheric carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) when compared with animals at higher trophic levels. First, we tested how differences in atmospheric δ 13 C values were transferred across three trophic levels. Second, we compared contemporary δ 13 C trends (1961 – 2004) in atmospheric CO 2 to δ 13 C patterns in a tree species (jack pine, Pinus banksiana), large herbivore (moose, Alces alces) and large carnivore (grey wolf, Canis lupus) from North America.

40|$|Observed 20 th century warming trends {{accompanied}} by more frequent weather extremes such as droughts or intense rainfall events have consequences for societies and environments alike. In Asia, {{where the majority}} of the population depend on agricultural productivity, recent climate change is likely to increase societal hardships. In order to quantify future climate variability, it is vital to understand past climate variability with respect to its magnitude, frequency and more importantly, its underlying physical processes. Since instrumental data scarcely extends into the pre- 1950 era in Asia, annually resolved proxy data such as tree rings provide unique and continuous estimates of past climate and atmospheric circulation variability. 	This thesis presents a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between tree growth and environmental factors using local to continental-scale tree-ring networks in Asia. In this regard, new tree-ring chronologies were developed for Central Asia in order to increase the spatial coverage of the existing proxy network. Analyses of five tree-ring width networks were conducted to identify the dominant climate and atmospheric circulation patterns that influence tree growth in Asia. 	Based on 38 newly developed juniper (<b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.)</b> tree-ring chronologies including 1069 trees from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in Central Asia, the first detailed study of spatial patterns and temporal trends in species- and site-specific climate response was conducted. Our results show that juniper growth at lower elevation sites was significantly limited by drought conditions, which has increased in intensity over the past decades, hence, making those sites highly suitable for drought reconstructions. The majority of juniper trees at high elevation sites, however, showed a distinct growth-climate response shift. In the early to mid- 20 th century, juniper growth was favored by warm summer temperatures, while in the most recent decades, it was negatively affected by increasing summer aridity. 	By calculating a new index that represents the tree growth relevant circulation pattern at the site during the summer, it was possible to describe leading patterns of the atmospheric circulation for a regional- and a continental-scale tree-ring network in Asia. The main results indicate that pressure anomalies over northwestern Russia had a major impact on tree growth not only in continental regions but also in monsoon influenced parts of Asia. The identified tree growth relevant circulation patterns show a significant spatiotemporal resemblance to leading patterns of pressure anomalies from climate data. Furthermore, the tree growth derived circulation patterns show strong linkages to the North Atlantic sector even further back in time (as far as AD 1600), and can be linked to the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation system. 	The findings presented in this thesis enhance our understanding of the influence of environmental factors on tree growth in Asia. Moreover, tree rings are shown to be a highly suitable proxy for reconstructing and investigating past climate and atmospheric circulation variability in Asia...|$|E
40|$|Coastal sandy {{ecosystems}} are littoral terrestrial habitats, which have strong and direct exchange with the sea. This fact lends a dynamic character to the ecosystem. Despite the dynamic features, these {{ecosystems are}} convenient to several activities. In Greεce {{the most important}} human pressures are those following the mass tourism. The present thesis focus at first in description of different patterns of vegetation in coastal dune ecosystems of Greece. An inductive approach is adopted and the data are classified leading to conclusions and hypothesis generation in three basic arguments - In wich way and why sandy vegetation and sand features are diversified in a sand dune ecosystem and between sand dune ecosystems. - Wich are the factors that define the placement and distribution of plant species. - In wich way the management of important sandy coastal habitats incorporates the research for answering the above subjects. These questions are faced studying the plant species distribution, their correlation with sandy substate characteristics and their response to the special features of each area. The following areas are studied since it was considered they represente a grate variety of coastal sand dune ecosystems in Greece. - Sxinias (Marathonas, Attica) - Aliki (Limnos, North Aegean Sea) - Elafonissi (Xania, Crete) - Sekania (Zakynthos, Ionio Sea) - Αγ. Άννα (Evoia) Geomorphology and climate data are used {{in order to obtain}} a general aspect of study areas. After a survey in all five areas and using biobliographical references in addition, respective coastal sand dune vulnerability checlists are completed. A transect-based method is selected as the most suitable for describing vegetation on sand dune ecosystems. Gradient analysis and orientetion techniques are used in order to define plant groups. Group’s structure was recorded using Importance values of the present plant species. Plant fuctional types of the dominant plant in each group are useful as verifiction or invalidation of previous techniques but also as ecological definition of each group domain. Along the transects and in every different zone, sand samples were collected and Concuctivity, Salinity, Sand Texture, Organic matter, pH were measured. Two of the study areas are used as case studies to face the third subject of the thesis since they are cinsidered as Ecological Important Areas: The sandy beach of Sekania that hosts by far the largest single nesting colony of Caretta caretta known in the Mediterranean, is mapped and nesting activity is studied in relation with vegetation and sand texture. The small islet Elaphonissi hosts two rare plant species (Silene succulenta ssp. succulenta and Centaurea pumilio). An experimental assesment of trampling impacts is conducted for these two species. Processing the data collected for the study areas the following plant groups are recorded (they are represented here by the one or two dominat plant species). Otanthus maritimus. Elymus farctus, Ammophila arenaria Anthemis tomentosa. Vuplia fasciculata, Bromus madridensis. Juncus sp., Schoenus nigricans. Coridothymus capitatus Pistacιa lentiscus, <b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.</b> The amplitude of environmental variables in each plant species group is recoreded. The presence or absence of a plant group and the floristic comosition and structure, are correlated with sand features and conclusion are derived considering the general conditions in the area which have been recorded in sand dune vulnerability checklist. As far as it conserns the two rare plant species grow in Elaphonissi: Silene succulenta ssp. Succulenta cover is much reduced even in a small pressure. Due to it’s height is deficult to avoid trampling. Nevertheless due to the grate flexibility of it’s shoot, it conserves a small cover even in maximium pressure. Centaurea pumilio is more resistant because of its morpology but in maximum pressure small cover remains. As far as it conserns the nesting beach of Caretta caretta Sekania The fact is that where salinity is high enough to prevent sand vegetation development, wet sand is located at a proper depth for excavating an egg chamber. Well-sorted sand grains favor nesting activity since sand is not coarse. This kind of sand allows the eggs to be aerated (gas exchange is facilitated), the water to be drained from the nests but also prevent egg chamber to collapse during construction. ...|$|E

For these reasons GIS as a methodology, is handled as an infrastructure formative of Geography with a view toidentifying the physical geographical features. Owing to digitized terrain database “Digital Elevation Model” model of GIS, the elevation, slope, aspect properties of thereservoir are displayed. The boundaries of the carstic reservoir area are also identified as correct as possible. It has beendetermined that the area of the region from which Sorgun Stream and it’s branches collects water is around 500 sq km’s widewhich extends in the North - South direction. Whereby various analyses the different valley types within the reservoir, drainagepatterns, longitudinal and crosscut profiles of the watercourse, the lengths of the main river and branches are displayed. Therefore, it was designated that Sorgun Stream has a main river length of 79 km’s between it’s spring at 2350 meters altitude andit’s river mouth and has a total length of 966 km’s with all it’s branches. Effects of topography and geological structure in the formation of running water system and distribution of water resourcesare displayed. It has been determined that the sources of the surface waters of the reservoir are cosequent streams and theevolution of the watercourse network depends on and extends towards the areas of week soil structure. The watercourse settleditself on the structure formed different drainage systems. It has been determined that the difference in the drainage systems is dueto the change of the general slope of the area towards south-west direction with epeirogenesis, which was towards South directionbefore Tertiary. The effects of faults and lengths of drifting areas, characteristics of litolojik structure, footprint of mountainous, plateau, hillygrounds areas which were effective {{in the formation of the}} reservoir are also determined. The properties of butte, crest, amphitheatre formation, plain area, cliff, meander, shore topography, carstic area, doline, cave,travertine area, ground and plant characteristics, field, length, amount and assortments are determined. At the same time, theeffects of heights, slope, aspect properties, topography, geologic structure, hydrographical structure and climate are identified. The 8 km long straight coastline extends at the south of the reservoir in the north-east to south-west direction. The Plato seenat - 20 meters depth in the sea starts at a distance of 200 meters from the west side of river-mouth of the Sorgun Stream and Erdemli lowland. It has been observed that, with 326 sq km wide area the tertiary terrain puts forward the general character of the reservoirwhich is followed by 154 sq km wide Mesozoic terrain and 19. 3 sq km wide Quaternary terrain. Reservoir also contains 4 explicitfault and 3 drifting areas. Elevation of the reservoir varies from 0 m to 2420 m and % 70 of the reservoir area elevation is higher than 1250 m whichcorresponds to 343 sq km wide area. The distribution slope of the area of the reservoir varies as follows :- % 26 of area have a slope of 0 degree to 5 degrees- % 52 of area have a slope of 5 degrees to 20 degrees- % 14 of area have a slope of 20 degrees to 30 degrees- % 8 of area have a slope over 30 degrees. Depending on the formation of the reservoir, the aspect shows different characters at the east end west of the Sorgun Streamand the detailed topographic structure causes varying properties of aspect. At the entrance from the Erdemli Plain to main valley; first the gorge with hillsides of average 200 m high, then the canyonextending from north to south direction with hillsides lined off cornice and towards the interior “V” type valleys takes place. The forest area of the reservoir totals to around 351 sq km and alluvial and organic soil area totals to 2 sq km. Around 1 / 7 ofthe area of the reservoir extends without any soil on it. Slopes more than 30 degrees are very effective for hillside erosions andsuch hillsides forms around % 8 of the reservoir area. It has been observed that the characteristic plants of the Sorgun Stream reservoir are red pine (Pinus brutia), black pine (Pinusnigra), oak (Quercus), juniper (<b>Juniperus</b> <b>sp.)</b> and cedar (Cedrus libani). During this research study the inconsistencies between various data collected by the several Governmental institutions wasnoticed. For example, while the 2000 m elevated area laying at the west of the track extending from Geriz Yaylağı to KemerYaylağı, was shown as soilless area by General Directorate of Rural Services; the General Directorate of Forestry has describedthis area as the agricultural area. Furthermore, the General Directorate of Forestry described the areas of higher than 300 - 400 msteep cornice at valley hillsides as agricultural areas. One of the most interesting facts of the reservoir is that depending on the special topographic conditions the existence of themountain alders, “which are the characteristic plants of the Black Sea climate” at the southwest of the lower path. By means of this research the main features of the presented possibilities by the GIS methodology for the field of physicalgeography are determined; therefore the reality that “GIS and Geography are founded on common scientific bases” weredesignated.
