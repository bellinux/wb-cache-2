500|$|The {{choice of}} Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's {{successor}} met with considerable criticism. Critics accused Kim Il-sung {{of creating a}} dynasty, turning North Korea into a feudal state. An anonymous South Korean critic said, [...] "Hereditary succession of power [...] inevitable consequence of the elder Kim's <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> to the dream of founding a dynasty {{of his own and}} of his family", adding that Kim Jong-il's rise to power was proof of the [...] "degeneration" [...] of the WPK into a [...] "thoroughly personalized family affair built up around a personality cult." [...] The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China and other ruling parties of socialist states did not approve Kim Jong-il's appointment as heir apparent. Kim Il-sung's choice of successor arguably concerned the promotion of revolutionary zeal in the country (taking into account the negative treatment Joseph Stalin received from his successor).|$|E

40|$|This paper adds {{to growing}} {{interest}} in public to private buy-outs and mechanisms to ensure bid success. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 155 public to private buy-outs we provide {{one of the first}} examinations of the determinants of <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitments.</b> <b>Irrevocable</b> <b>commitments</b> involve undertakings given by existing shareholders to agree to sell their shares to the bidder before the bid to take the company private is announced. We find that, for management buy-outs, the level of <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitments</b> is increased by the bid premium, the reputation of the private equity backer and board shareholdings. The level of <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitments</b> is reduced by rumours of a takeover bid and bid value. We therefore find evidence that management and private equity firms' activity prior to the bid's announcement can have an important impact on the process of going private.

40|$|RA 410. 55. A 2 Although the Government {{remains the}} main {{provider}} {{of health care}} services in Kenya, Faith Based Hospitals are a crucial component of our society today. Faith Based Health System operates a total of 993 (about 40 %) health facilities in the country comprising of large (secondary) and medium (primary) referral hospitals, health centres, dispensaries and community based health care programs (MOH 2011). Faith Based Hospitals have complemented {{the role played by}} the government in the provision of affordable health care in areas where the government was not involved or has not ventured into. Despite the significant contribution made by Faith Based Hospitals in health service delivery, they may have failed to respond adequately to the emerging challenges in the health sector so as to enhance their sustainability. Specifically they may have not sufficiently invested in key areas like resource mobilization, strategic approach to operations and adoption of responsive management practices. This study therefore, sought to assess health care financing strategies in Faith Based Hospitals and their impact on financial sustainability. This study was guided by these objectives; to determine the effect of patient revenue, health insurance, entrepreneurial activities and donor funding on financial sustainability in Faith Based Hospitals. The study also sought to determine the relationship between financial reporting, control environment practices and financial sustainability among Faith Based Hospitals. Survey was used to provide qualitative and numeric descriptions of the sample population. Survey assisted in investigating populations by selecting samples to analyze and discover occurrences. The study was conducted in Faith Based Hospitals in Central Province of Kenya owned by both Kenya Episcopal Conference-Catholic Secretariat (KEC-CS) and Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK) for protestant churches. The sample was based on probability sampling procedures. Two sampling techniques were used under probability sampling namely; purposive sampling and stratified random sampling. Data collection was carried out using a semi-structured questionnaire and intended respondents were those who were involved in governance, management and implementation of core health programs of these hospitals. Descriptive statistical method was mainly used for data analysis such as frequencies, percentages and averages. Qualitative analysis of the responses was done as responded in the questionnaires to analyze the relationship between health care financing practices and financial sustainability in Faith Based Health Institutions. This study is expected to reveal the relationship between health care financing practices and financial sustainability. The results will hopefully assist managers in Faith Based Hospitals, entrepreneurs and other organizations to improve on management practices and as a result enhance sustainability of their institutions. Health care financing remains a critical element of the social and economic development of this country. An appropriate financing mechanism will enable the health sector to deliver on critical millennium development goals to which Kenya has made <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitments.</b> Kenyatta Universit...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} on the political economy of global financial liberalisation shows how little has been written {{on the role of the}} OECD, and how the Principal-Agent (PA) theory, complemented by Constructivist tools, can be applied helpfully to analyse this process. We show that the OECD’s Committee on Capital Movements and Invisible Transactions (CMIT) played an entrepreneurial role in encouraging the liberalization of capital flows. In particular, we argue that the CMIT slipped by acting beyond its core delegation roles and against the preferences of the OECD member states’ governments. This was done by discussing and seeking to expand the list of issue areas on which controls should be lifted to include short-term capital movements and the right of establishment, to adopt an extended understanding of reciprocity, and to eliminate a range of additional discriminatory measures on capital flows. Acting as institutional entrepreneurs, the CMIT members took advantage of the overlap among the networks in which they were engaged to spread their ideas to the member states. The CMIT’s work affected the member states’ willingness to make <b>irrevocable,</b> multilateral <b>commitments</b> through a combination of peer pressure and vertical institutional interconnectedness. Through the work of the CMIT, the OECD was an important actor in capital liberalization, in addition to the role played by other international organizations...|$|R

Commitment to flowering and spike production were favoured by 20 or more SD cycles. Floret number per spike and percentage seed set were not affected by return to LD. Within individual plants, sections of terminal and branch apices revealed a range of development stages. Terminal apices of well developed lateral branches were able to initiate as soon as, or sooner than, terminal apices of the main branch in this usually determinate plant; this points to individual branches having some autonomy for floral initiation, but suggests dissections made from well developed lateral branches would be a feasible method for determining floral initiation where plant replication is limited. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between standardization processes, {{intellectual property rights}} and competition rules has increasingly become {{of interest in the}} recent years. Recent investigations of the European Commission confirm that standardization processes and in particular ownership of IPRs that cover standardized technology might in certain circumstances infringe competition rules. The article first explores the meaning and different forms of standardization. It then analyses selected parts of the Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-operation agreements, in particular those parts that cover standardisation agreements. The Guidelines have been adopted by the Commission in December 2010 with a view to addressing the anti-competitive concerns stemming from inter alia standardisation agreements (eg, they encourage IPRs holders to disclose their exclusive rights before the adoption of the standard, as well as to give an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> to offer to license the IPR to all parties interested on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms: so-called FRAND commitment). The author will then present and comment on different points of view on whether the ownership of IPRs which cover standardized technologies really create market dominance capable of triggering anti-competitive behaviours.

Expression vectors containing either {{normal or}} oncogenic point-mutated human c-fms genes were transfected into interleukin 3 (IL- 3) -dependent 32 D cells {{in order to}} determine the effects of CSF- 1 signaling in this murine clonal myeloid progenitor cell line. CSF- 1 was shown to trigger proliferation in association with monocytic differentiation of the 32 D-c-fms cells. Monocytic differentiation was reversible upon removal of CSF- 1, implying that CSF- 1 was required for maintenance of the monocyte phenotype but was not sufficient to induce an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> to differentiation. Human CSF- 1 was also shown to be a potent chemoattractant for 32 D-c-fms cells, suggesting that CSF- 1 may serve to recruit monocytes from the circulation to tissue sites of inflammation or injury. Although c-fms did not release 32 D cells from factor dependence, point-mutated c-fms[S 301,F 969] (Leu- 301 [...] Ser, Tyr- 969 [...] Phe) was able to abrogate their IL- 3 requirement and induce tumorigenicity. IL- 3 -independent 32 D-c-fms[S 301,F 969] cells also displayed a mature monocyte phenotype, implying that differentiation did not interfere with progression of these cells to the malignant state.

40|$|Given a bimatrix game, the {{associated}} leadership or commitment games {{are defined as}} the games at which one player, the leader, commits to a (possibly mixed) strategy and the other player, the follower, chooses his strategy after having observed the <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> of the leader. Based on a result by von Stengel and Zamir [2010], the notions of commitment value and commitment optimal strategies for each player are discussed as a possible solution concept. It is shown that in non-degenerate bimatrix games (a) pure commitment optimal strategies together with the follower's best response constitute Nash equilibria, and (b) strategies that participate in a completely mixed Nash equilibrium are strictly worse than commitment optimal strategies, provided they are not matrix game optimal. For various classes of bimatrix games that generalize zero sum games, {{the relationship between the}} maximin value of the leader's payoff matrix, the Nash equilibrium payoff and the commitment optimal value is discussed. For the Traveler's Dilemma, the commitment optimal strategy and commitment value for the leader are evaluated and seem more acceptable as a solution than the unique Nash equilibrium.

40|$|Development and {{organization}} of procurement strategies have escalated in importance with maturity of the food processing industry, {{as well as with}} the prospect of greater choice attributable to variety development and information technology. Conventional alternatives for procurement range from spot purchases with specifications for easily measurable characteristics, to varying forms of strategies with pre-commitment. In the case of grains these choices are complicated by two factors. First, there is intrinsic uncertainty associated with end-use qualities that are not easily measurable. Second, grain prices and therefore procurement costs vary spatially due to competing market regions. Thus, shifting origins may involve higher cost due to having to bid grain away from its next best market. We posed three procurement strategies and developed analytical models to evaluate the risks and costs among these alternatives in the case of hard red spring (HRS) wheat. The first involves no commitment. The second involves some form of <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> and the third entails less commitment. Stochastic simulation models were developed for each with an objective of cost minimization subject to different levels of risk. The results indicate that the naive strategy has the lowest expected cost, but a fairly high probability of not conforming to end-use requirements. The constant share strategies result in higher probabilities of meeting requirements, but at substantially higher costs. The opportunistic strategy results in a higher probability of meeting requirements than either of the other two alternative strategies at a comparable cost. Marketing, Agribusiness,...|$|E
40|$|Lending to an Insecure Sovereign This paper {{analyzes}} a reputational equilibrium for sovereigndebt in a {{model in}} which the sovereign borrows to finance spending for defense against threats to its survival in power. In this model, the amount of sovereign debt and defense spending, the resulting survival probability, and the sovereign's implied discount rate for future consumption are determined simultaneously. The optimal amount of debt and defense spending equates the marginal cost of defense spending in reducing the level of consumption to the marginal benefit of defense spending in increasing the probability of surviving to enjoy future consumption. In the reputational equilibrium, however, the amount of debt and the associated discount rate must be small enough that the short—run gains from debt repudiation are not larger than the long—run costs {{from the loss of}} a trustworthy reputation.

As such, {{the point of no}} return reflects a fundamental limit on the ability to control thought and action. I review the literature on {{the point of no return}}, taking three perspectives. First, I consider the point of no return from the perspective of the controlled act, as a locus in the architecture and anatomy of the underlying processes. I review experiments from the stop-signal paradigm that suggest that the point of no return is located late in the response system. Then I consider the point of no return from the perspective of the act of control that tries to change the controlled act before it becomes irrevocable. From this perspective, the point of no return is a point in time that provides enough “lead time ” for the act of control to take effect. I review experiments that measure the response time to the stop signal as the lead time required for response inhi-bition in the stop-signal paradigm. Finally, I consider the point of no return in hierarchically controlled tasks, in which there may be many points of no return at different levels of the hierarchy. I review exper-iments on skilled typing that suggest different points of no return for the commands that determine what is typed and the countermands that inhibit typing, with increasing commitment to action the lower the level in the hierarchy.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} law and competition law {{have been playing}} {{an important role in}} the field of licensing SEPs. During the standardisation process with the SSO, the patent holder gives its <b>irrevocable</b> <b>commitment</b> to license the patent under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND). If and when subsequent licensing negotiations fail with the implementer the SEP holder usually files a suit of infringement and applies for an injunction. The implementer’s response usually comprises a competition law defence relying on FRAND commitment given by the SEP holder. Case law of the CJEU and the Commission together with national litigation have examined the interplay between the SEP holders exclusive patent right and competition rules, both of which have the common goal at the end: incentivising innovation and ensuring free competition. The thesis seeks to answer the question of why and under what circumstances FRAND-encumbered SEP holder is barred from seeking injunctive relief by the presumption of abuse under Art. 102 TFEU. The question will be analysed in the light of the Huawei ruling delivered by the CJEU. Subsequent national cases applying the negotiation framework set forth by the ruling will be examined. The thesis follows the traditional dogmatic legal approach. The thesis makes use of the primary sources of law in form of EU and other international treaties. Secondary sources of law entail the body of case law from the CJEU and the Commission. The thesis suggests that the ruling delivered in Huawei has not fully addressed the issue of when and on what terms access to SEPs should be granted while conforming to EU competition law. The Court took a very careful approach in its decision and many open questions remain to be resolved by the national courts. The most pressing questions relate to the determination of FRAND. However, the ruling did establish a negotiation framework against which the conduct of the SEP holder and the implementer may be assessed...|$|E
