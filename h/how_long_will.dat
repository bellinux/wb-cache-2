25|$|So {{far there}} has been tacit {{approval}} between the central government and Pointe-Noire and the Department of Kouilou: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region. For example, Stéphane Tchitchéllé, Dr. Jacques Bouiti, Marcel Tchionvo, Jean-Pierre Thysthère Tchicaya, François-Luc Makosso, Roland Bouiti-Viaudo and the current director-Mayor Jean-François Kando (elected since 28th August 2017), are noted. The fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo.

500|$|And he {{denounced the}} German {{military}} for their policies against the resistance {{forces in the}} occupied lands. On 26 October 1941 he wrote: In France two German officers have been shot by unknown murderers, in Nantes and Bordeaux. In retribution fifty citizens {{in each of these}} towns were apprehended and executed. To let people who are completely innocent suffer for the deed of another reminds us of the terrific deeds of wild beasts in times long gone. It was General von Stulpnagel's lot to revive one of the most gruesome deeds.

500|$|While his {{explanation}} {{was found to}} be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two orioles he had seen building a nest outside his window. Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair [...] "plainly deliberated" [...] their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then [...] "tied a single knot at the extreme end" [...] of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time. Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. The Atlantic Monthly did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by Century Magazine. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, [...] "After such an example as this, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>will</b> it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{picture of}} Moses {{presented}} in the midrash is to some extent that of [...] a martyr figure. [...] Moses is unloved and barely tolerated by his own people (in stark contrast to their adoration of his brother), and is constantly upbraided by God for every remark [...] which casts the Children of Israel in a negative light. [...] For example, the Israelites attack Moses for having taken them out of Egypt, and threaten his life, but when Moses reports to God this deteriorating situation, the response is: [...] "Moses, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>will</b> you continue to defame my children?" ...|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{short period}} during the {{introduction}} of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the Gutenberg Bible are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, Johannes Trithemius preferred the older methods, because [...] "handwriting placed on parchment {{will be able to}} endure a thousand years.
