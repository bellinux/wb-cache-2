5|$|In {{the ninth}} century Orcadian control {{stretched}} into Moray, {{which was a}} semi-independent kingdom <b>for</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> early period. The Moray rulers MacBeth (1040–1057) and his successor Lulach (1057–1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time. However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, Óengus of Moray was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as {{would be the case}} in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings <b>for</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, with its many {{competing}} kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship was not inherited {{in a direct}} line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed {{to be a member}} of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings <b>for</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have received rewards in return. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training {{to cope with the}} demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. <b>For</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying Training School and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E
