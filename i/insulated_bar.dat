50|$|To {{reduce heat}} flow and the U-factor, metal frames {{should have an}} {{insulating}} plastic profile placed between the {{inside and outside of}} the frame and sash. These profiles are called also thermal break and they are made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide 66. The glass fibre proportion is 25 %. The material used for this <b>insulating</b> <b>bar</b> stands out for its low thermal conductivity value = 0.30 W/mK and its good mechanical properties - even at higher temperatures.|$|R

40|$|We study an {{electrically}} controlled quantum spin Hall antidot {{embedded in}} a two-dimensional topological <b>insulating</b> <b>bar.</b> Helical edge states around the antidot and {{along the edges of}} the bar are tunnel coupled. The close connection between spin and chirality, typical of helical systems, allows to generate a spin-polarized current flowing across the bar. This current is studied {{as a function of the}} external voltages, by varying the asymmetry between the barriers. For asymmetric setups, a switching behavior of the spin current is observed as the bias is increased, both in the absence and in the presence of electron interactions. This device allows to generate and control the spin-polarized current by simple electrical means. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|WO 2005096391 A UPAB: 20051122 NOVELTY - The module has {{solar cells}} with {{substrates}} accommodating an electroconductive transparent layer (2), {{a counter electrode}} (5) and a porous support layer (3). The cells are separated from each other by an <b>insulating</b> <b>bar</b> and are arranged like meander. Each cell has a filling orifice to fill dye and/ electrolyte. The electrode has a channel and/or profiler for forming cavities to receive and transmit the dye and/or electrolyte. USE - Photo-electrochemical solar cell module. ADVANTAGE - The module reduces the number of filler holes and also {{the resistance of the}} cell. The cells are arranged like meander, thus reducing space requirement in the module. The channel and/or profiler of the counter electrode form cavities to receive and transmit the dye and/or electrolyte, so that an improved distribution of the coloring material and/or electrolytes can be realized in each cell...|$|R
5000|$|A punch-down block (also punchdown block, punch block, punchblock, quick-connect {{block and}} other variations) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} connection often used in telephony. It is named because the solid copper wires are [...] "punched down" [...] into short open-ended slots which are a type of insulation-displacement connectors. These slots, usually cut crosswise (not lengthwise) across an <b>insulating</b> plastic <b>bar,</b> contain two sharp metal blades which cut through the wire's insulation as it is punched down. These blades hold the wire in position and make the electrical contact with the wire as well.|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to build a variety of very simple – and yet functioning – electric devices using common materials. These devices {{can be used to}} verify Electromagnetism fundamentals. Electric currents within magnetic fields originate forces and that is the basic principle of operation of electric motors. This paper describes a universal series motor made with iron <b>bars,</b> <b>insulated</b> copper wire, two small brass plates, insulating tape, six screws and a couple of hoops. The motor is fed with a personal computer 12 V DC switched power supply. Rotor speed can achieve several rotations per second...|$|R
50|$|The {{report on}} the {{accident}} by Colonel Pringle stated that the LMS conversion from gas to electric lighting was not going {{as fast as the}} Board of Trade (HMRI) had hoped, and had the rolling stock of the train been electrically lit, the effects of the collision would have been greatly mitigated. It also recommended the installation of the GWR invention of automatic train control, a system which worked by having an <b>insulated</b> steel <b>bar</b> laid centrally between the rails at all distant signals. When a train passed over it, the bar made contact with a spring-loaded shoe and so raised it. When the lever in the signal box was at 'clear', the bar was electrified and when a train passed over it a bell was sounded in the cab because the current passed through the shoe. However, when the lever was at 'caution', the shoe remained dead and when it was raised it broke an electrical circuit in the locomotive, sounding an alarm whistle in the cab and opening an air valve on the brake pipes, thus clearing the vacuum and applying the automatic vacuum brakes. This alone could have prevented the disaster.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a fully automatic system we developed to fill, from an external gas bottle, the ion sourer terminal gas storage bottle of a 2 MV Van de Graaff accelerator without depressing the 25 <b>bar</b> <b>insulating</b> gas. The system {{is based on}} a programmable automate ordering electropneumatical valves. The only manual operation is the connection of the external gas cylinder. The time needed for a gas change is reduced to typically 15 min (depending on the residual pressure wished for the gas removed from the terminal bottle). To check this system we study the ionic composition of the ion beam delivered by our accelerator after different gas changes. The switching magnet of our accelerator was used to analyse the ionic composition of the accelerated beams in order to verify the degree of elimination of the previous gases in the system.

The method used in this research is normative and empirical legal research and analytical descriptive nature by using primary legal materials, secondary and tertiary analyzed normatively. Based on research conducted by the author in pre Correctional Institution Class I Medan the number of perpetrators of criminal acts resulting in the increasing number of prisoners / prisoners are serving a prison sentence in the Penitentiary. Summing up, first, the implementation of parole for abusers of narcotic refers to the Indonesian Government Regulation Number 99 of 2012, Second, efforts to address the employees of prisons are required to discipline the prisoners for good behavior, requiring tightening legislation, increasing the number of prison staff, perform retrieval Quotes Judge (Extra verdict).
