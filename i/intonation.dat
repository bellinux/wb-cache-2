5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} <b>intonation</b> in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing <b>intonation</b> was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English <b>Intonation</b> notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for <b>intonation.</b> Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's <b>intonation</b> curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the <b>intonation</b> contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intonation</b> in {{indicative}} clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, {{falls on}} the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative <b>intonation</b> rises on the penultimate and {{falls on the}} last syllable.|$|E

5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and <b>intonation</b> of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for <b>intonation</b> on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E

5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, <b>intonation,</b> prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and <b>intonation</b> of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, {{although}} closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the differences on ultrastructure of the cochleae caused by different classic musical opuses with different <b>intonations.</b> Guinea pigs were grouped into 3, one of which was the control and the other two were the experimental groups. While the first group, which was the control, was not exposed to any music, the second group was exposed to classic musical opuses with extensive intervals (40 decibel) and third group was exposed to classical music opuses with strained <b>intonations</b> (60 decibel) for 6 h a day with 15 min-intervals for totally 10 days. Cochleae tissue samples were taken from the guinea pigs at the end of the tenth day. They were examined at the electron microscopic level. In addition to compansatris processes on the cochleae, thickening on the stereocilias of hair cells and basal membranes and proliferation on the synaptic terminalles of afferent nerves caused by extensive <b>intonations</b> were observed. Extremely obvious degenerative differences such as damage in neuroepitelial cells, nerves and synaptic terminalles as well as compansatris processes caused by strained <b>intonations</b> were determined. As a result of all these observations it was concluded that continuously listening to the strained <b>intonations</b> used in musical opuses has a very harmful effect on the auditory system. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc...|$|R

5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four {{syllable}} metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or <b>intonation</b> rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. <b>Intonation</b> is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by <b>intonation.</b> Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E

5|$|The {{methods for}} {{creating}} poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are {{often described as}} having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Syllable-timed languages include Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish. English, Russian and, generally, German are stress-timed languages. Varying <b>intonation</b> also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch, such as in Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or tone. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and <b>intonation</b> (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or <b>intonation,</b> all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E

However, this does not differentiate the different <b>intonations</b> that short tones can have.|$|R

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and <b>intonation</b> {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura's direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and <b>intonation</b> of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed {{it as part of}} a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.|$|E
