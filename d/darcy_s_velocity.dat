When the flow is sufficiently slow and the porosity relatively homogeneous and low, <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> law is the homogenized equation arising from the Stokes and Navier- Stokes equations and depends on a single effective parameter (the absolute permeability). However when the model is extended to multiphase flows, the assumptions are much more restrictive and less realistic. Therefore it is often {{used in conjunction with}} empirical models (such as relative permeability and capillary pressure curves), derived usually from phenomenological speculations and experimental data fitting. In this work, we present the results of a Bayesian calibration of a two-phase flow model, using high-fidelity DNS numerical simulation (at the pore-scale) in a realistic porous medium. These reference results have been obtained from a Navier-Stokes solver coupled with an explicit interphase-tracking scheme.

40|$|Surface {{granular}} flow, comprising {{granular material}} flowing {{on the surface}} of a heap of the same material, occurs in several industrial and natural systems. The rheology of such a flow was investigated by means of measurements of velocity and number-density profiles in a quasi-two-dimensional rotating cylinder, half-filled with a model granular material - monosize spherical stainless-steel particles. The measurements were made at the Centre of the cylinder, where the flow is fully developed, using streakline photography and image analysis. The stress profile was computed from the number-density profile using a force balance which takes into account wall friction. Mean-velocity and root-mean-square (r. m. s.) -velocity profiles are reported for different particle sizes and cylinder rotation speeds. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when distance is scaled by the particle diameter d and velocity by a characteristic shear rate gamma(C) = [g sin(beta(m) - beta(s)) /d cos beta(s) ] 1 / 2 and the particle diameter, where beta(m) is the maximum dynamic angle of repose and beta(s) is the static angle of repose. The maximum dynamic angle of repose is found to vary with the local flow rate. The scaling is also found to work for the r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles. The mean velocity is found to decay exponentially with depth in the bed, with decay length lambda = 1. 1 d. The r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> shows similar behaviour but with lambda = 1. 7 d. The r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> profile shows two regimes: near the free surface the r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> is nearly constant and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate, obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, is not constant anywhere in the layer and has a maximum which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> profile. Above the transition point the velocity distributions are Gaussian and below the transition point the velocity distributions gradually approach a Poisson distribution. The shear stress increases roughly linearly with depth. The variation in the apparent viscosity eta with r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> u shows a relatively sharp transition at the shear-rate maximum, and in the region below this point the apparent viscosity eta similar to u(- 1. 5). The measurements indicate that the flow comprises two layers: an upper low-viscosity layer with a nearly constant r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity</b> and a lower layer of increasing viscosity with a decreasing r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocity.</b> The thickness of the upper layer depends on the local flow rate and is independent of particle diameter while the reverse is found to hold for the lower-layer thickness.

40|$|Linear {{surface wave}} {{scattering}} theory {{is used to}} reconstruct he lateral heterogeneity under Europe and the Mediterranean using surface wave data recorded with the Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs (NARS). The waveform inversion of the phase and the amplitude of the direct surface wave leads to a variance reduction of approximately 40 % and results in phase velocity maps in the period ranges 30 - 40 s, 40 - 60 s and 60 - 100 s. A resolution analysis is performed {{in order to establish}} the lateral resolution of these inversions. Using the phase velocity perturbations of the three period bands, a two-layer model for the <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> under Europe and the Mediterranean is constructed. The <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> perturbations in the deepest layer (100 - 200 km) are much more pronounced than in the top layer (0 - 100 kin), which confirms that the low-velocity zone exhibits pronounced lateral variations. In both layers the <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> is low under the western Mediterranean, while the <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> is high under the Scandinavian shield. In the deepest layer a high <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> region extends from Greece under the Adriatic to northem Italy. Several interesting smaller features, such as the Massif Central, are reconstructed. One of the spectacular features of the reconstructed models is a sharp transition in the layer between 100 and 200 km near the Tomquist-Tesseyre zone. This would indicate that there is a sharp transition at depth between Central Europe and the East European platform. The waveform inversion of the surface wave coda leads to good waveform fits, but the reconstructed models are chaotic. This is due both to a lack of sufficient data for a good imaging of the surface wave energy on the heterogeneities and to an appreciable noise component in the surface wave coda...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} deep {{structure}} of Iceland, we conducted S receiver function analysis for almost 60 local broad-band seismograph {{stations of the}} Hotspot, ICEMELT and SIL networks. The structure was investigated separately for the central region of Iceland containing the neovolcanic zone and two peripheral regions {{to the east and}} west. S-to-P converted phases from upper-mantle discontinuities were detected by stacking recordings of several tens of teleseismic events. The analysis reveals previously unknown details. Magnitude and depth extent of the low <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> anomaly in the upper mantle beneath Iceland are much larger than reported in earlier studies. Clear S-to-P converted phases are obtained from the discontinuity at a depth of 80 ± 5 km, separating the high-velocity mantle lid from the underlying low <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> layer. This discontinuity can be interpreted as a chemical boundary between dry harzburgite in the upper layer and wet peridotite underneath. Beneath peripheral parts of Iceland, we detect a boundary at a depth of 135 ± 5 km with <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> increasing downwards. This boundary may correspond to the onset of melting in wet peridotite at a potential temperature of around 1400 °C. Models of melting induced by CO 2 are not incompatible with our observations.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of the absolute <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities</b> of the oceanic lithosphere is mainly based on global surface wave tomography, local active seismic or compliance measurements using oceanic infragravity waves. The results of tomography give a rather smooth picture of the actual <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> structure and local measurements have limitations regarding the range of elastic parameters or the geometry of the measurement. Here, we use the P wave polarization (apparent P wave incidence angle) of teleseismic events to investigate the <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> structure of the oceanic crust and the upper tens of kilometres of the mantle beneath single stations. In this study, we present an up to our knowledge new relation of the apparent P wave incidence angle at the ocean bottom dependent on the half space <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity.</b> We analyse the angle in different period ranges at ocean bottom stations (OBS) to derive apparent <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> profiles. These profiles are dependent on the <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> {{as well as on}} the thickness of the layers in the subsurface. Consequently, their interpretation results in a set of equally valid models. We analyse the apparent P wave incidence angles of an OBS data set which was collected in the Eastern Mid Atlantic. We are able to determine reasonable S wave velocity-depth models by a three step quantitative modelling after a manual data quality control, although layer resonance sometimes influences the estimated apparent <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities.</b> The apparent <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> profiles are well explained by an oceanic PREM model in which the upper part is replaced by four layers consisting of a water column, a sediment, a crust and a layer representing the uppermost mantle. The obtained sediment has a thickness between 0. 3 km and 0. 9 km with <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities</b> between 0. 7 km s− 1 and 1. 4 km s− 1. The estimated total crustal thickness varies between 4 km and 10 km with <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities</b> between 3. 5 km s− 1 and 4. 3 km s− 1. We find a slight increase of the total crustal thickness from ∼ 5 km to ∼ 8 km towards the South in the direction of a major plate boundary, the Gloria Fault. The observed crustal thickening can be related with the known dominant compression in the vicinity of the fault. Furthermore, the resulting mantle <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities</b> decrease from values around 5. 5 km s− 1 to 4. 5 km s− 1 towards the fault. This decrease is probably caused by serpentinization and indicates that the oceanic transform fault affects a broad region in the uppermost mantle. Conclusively, the presented method is useful for the estimation of the local <b>S</b> wave <b>velocity</b> structure beneath ocean bottom seismic stations. It is easy to implement and consists of two main steps: (1) measurement of apparent P wave incidence angles in different period ranges for real and synthetic data, and (2) comparison of the determined apparent <b>S</b> wave <b>velocities</b> for real and synthetic data to estimate S wave velocity-depth models...|$|R
40|$|The Archean Dharwar craton {{in south}} India {{is known for}} long time to be {{different}} from most other cratons. Specifically, at station Hyderabad (HYB) the Ps converted phases from the 410 - and 660 -km mantle discontinuities arrive up to 2 s later than in other cratons of comparable age, which implies lower upper mantle velocities. To resolve the unique lithosphere-asthenosphere system of the Dharwar craton, we inverted jointly P and S receiver functions and teleseismic P and S traveltime residuals at 10 seismograph stations. This method operates in the same depth range as long-period surface waves but differs by much higher lateral and radial resolution. We observe striking differences in crustal structures between the eastern and western Dharwar craton (EDC and WDC, respectively) : crustal thickness is of around 31 km, with predominantly felsic velocities, in the EDC and of around 55 km, with predominantly mafic velocities, in the WDC. In the mantle we observe significant variations in the P velocity with depth, practically without accompanying variations in the <b>S</b> <b>velocity.</b> In the mantle <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> there are azimuth-dependent indications of the Hales discontinuity at a depth of similar to 100 km.

The <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> in our models is close to 4. 5 km s(- 1) from the Moho to a depth of similar to 250 km. There are indications of a similar upper mantle structure in the northeast of the Indian craton and of a partial recovery of the normal shield structure in the northwest.

Measurements have been made of unsaturated and saturated lateral soil water flow on a convex hil-slope with a good soil cover and impermeable bedrock during natural rainstorms. The hydraulics of flow are examined in detail with particular reference {{to the role of}} breaks in vertical permeabilty, the change from saturated to unsaturated flow and the velocity of flow. In this instance, after rainfall slope flow is dominated by vertical unsaturated movement towards the profie base. Preceding upslope moisture gra-dients result in the growth of a zone of soil saturation upwards from the slope base: Slope discharge through the Band B/C horizons, is related to the form of the saturation zone, within which flow is lateral according to <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> law. The time required for vertical percolation and the low hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil horizons result in a hilslope hydrograph which is delayed and attenuated and cannot be regarded as storm flow. During drainage the saturation zone contracts and is replaced by a lateral un-saturated flow system at the profie base which supplies discharge from the B/C horizon for up to 42 days without further recharge. It is concluded that, in general, either distinct soil horizons or impermeable bedrock are essential for the initiation of lateral flow. Saturated flow is likely to dominate hilslope hydro-graphs through non-capilary pore spaces but these may be integrated to the point where <b>Darcy</b> <b>s</b> law stil holds. Although lateral soil water flow must be a widespread phenomenon, it is unlikely to provide storm runoff to the stream unless saturated conditions are generated within the organic horizons or flow within the lower soil horizons is dominated by non-Darcian flow through non-capilary spaces in the soil...|$|R

In order to dispose of correct PP and PS traveltimes for the inversion, we applied the PP and PS SMART 2 D method. Additional and reliable PP prestack traveltimes have been obtained. At the time of writing, the traveltime retrieval for the PS data is not yet finished, but it is expected that additional and reliable traveltimes will also be found since the interpretation and the pairing of PP and PS reflections appear easier in the depth domain than in the time domain.

Precise location of hypocenters requires a very accurate P and <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> model, the calibration of this model is a difficult task but cannot be neglected. In addition, this required calibration/inversion of the velocities is a totally non-linear problem; taking into account this difficulty we developed a non-linear (Monte Carlo) tomographic inversion algorithm. This paper presents our non-linear calibration algorithm that updates the P and <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> model in the context of Passive Seismic Monitoring. Furthermore the uncertainties associated to the velocity model are computed...|$|R
40|$|Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Malcolm J. Andrews The self-similar {{evolution}} of a turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) mix is investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. The experiments consisted of velocity and density measurements using thermocouples and Particle Image Velocimetry techniques. A novel experimental technique, termed PIV-S, to simultaneously measure both velocity and density fields was developed. These measurements provided data for turbulent correlations, power spectra, and energy balance analyses. The self-similarity of the flow is demonstrated through velocity profiles that collapse when normalized by an appropriate similarity variable and power spectra that evolve in a shape-preserving form. In the self-similar regime, vertical r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocities</b> dominate over the horizontal r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>velocities</b> with a ratio of 2 : 1. This anisotropy, also observed in the velocity spectra, extends to the Taylor scales. Buoyancy forcing does not alter {{the structure of the}} density spectra, which are seen to have an inertial range with a – 5 / 3 slope. A scaling analysis was performed to explain this behavior. Centerline velocity fluctuations drive the growth of the flow, and can hence be used to deduce the growth constant. The question o...|$|R
40|$|Summary. S-wave arrival {{times from}} 30 {{earthquakes}} of the New Hebrides island arc are read from long-period {{components of the}} WWSS network, within the distance range 30 - 80 ". S residuals from deep earthquakes of the New Hebrides and Tonga arcs are used to correct the residuals from the lower mantle effect and station corrections. An average delay of 3 to 4 s is found. This shows {{the existence of a}} low-velocity zone for S waves in the convex side of the arc. A three-dimensional inversion scheme is used to obtain the velocity structure of this zone. Other seismological data, such as pP attenuation, confirm the results of the inversion: two zones with low shear velocity (5 to 10 per cent lower than the J-B model) are defined. The first one is located beneath the d'Entrecasteaux fracture zone at a depth range of 150 to 350 km and the second one is in the south-west of the arc at the same depth range. Furthermore the deep upper mantle north of 16 " S shows a normal <b>S</b> <b>velocity,</b> while south of 16 's it shows a low <b>S</b> <b>velocity.</b> A geo-dynamical model based on these results is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} S-wave interval velocity, using P-S seismic data is presented. The method {{is composed of}} three steps. First, the P-S data are converted to a relative change in S-velocity section. The section is then linearized. Constrained inversion is used to convert this last section to S-interval velocity. To illustrate the method, the <b>S</b> <b>velocity</b> of a field data set was derived, and a Vp/Vs section was computed. The constrained inversion was found to provide reasonable velocities and Vp/Vs...|$|R
