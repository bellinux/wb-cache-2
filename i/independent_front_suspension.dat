25|$|A minor {{evolution}} of the preceding One-O-Four, the Majestic, like all new Daimlers following 1937's New Fifteen, was designed around that same massive cruciform-braced box-section chassis equipped with André Girling's design of coil-sprung <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> with a well-located hypoid bevel driven 'live' rear axle using semi-elliptic springs.|$|E
25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. <b>Independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by Panhard rod.|$|E

25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|New for 1929 was the Peugeot 201, the {{cheapest}} {{car on the}} French market, {{and the first to}} use the later Peugeot trademark (and registered as such)—three digits with a central zero. The 201 would get <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> in 1931, Soon afterwards, the Depression hit; Peugeot sales decreased, but the company survived. The Peugeot system of using three digit names with a central 0 was introduced in 1929. The first digit has always signified the car's size and the final digit has indicated the generation of vehicle.|$|E
25|$|All was {{not well}} financially and the {{receiver}} was called in 1935, but the company was bought by Alan P. Good, who just outbid Rolls-Royce. He also persuaded W. O. Bentley to leave Rolls-Royce and join Lagonda as designer along with many of his racing department staff. The 4.5-litre range now became the LG45 with lower but heavier bodies and also available in LG45R Rapide form. The LG45 came in three versions known as Sanction 1, 2 and 3 each with more Bentley touches to the engine. In 1938 the LG6 with <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> by torsion bar and hydraulic brakes came in.|$|E
50|$|The 135 {{featured}} <b>independent,</b> leaf-sprung <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> a live rear axle, {{and cable}} operated Bendix brakes. 17-inch spoked wheels were also standard. Transmission {{was either a}} partially synchronized four-speed manual or four-speed Cotal pre-selector transmission.|$|R
50|$|The LT was {{equipped}} with a <b>front</b> axle with <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> wheel <b>suspension.</b> Later options, such as the heavy LT 40 to LT 55, had a solid front axle to achieve increased to load-carrying capacity as is common for light trucks.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} a fully <b>independent</b> torsion bar <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and a multilink coil sprung rear suspension integrated with a solid rear axle.|$|R
25|$|It was an {{innovative}} design and used lightweight aluminium along with techniques developed in aircraft production during World War II. As {{well as a}} novel, weight-saving integral design, it also introduced {{for the first time}} on a bus <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> power steering, a fully automatic gearbox and power-hydraulic braking. This surprised some early drivers, who found the chassis unexpectedly light and nimble compared with older designs, especially as depicted on film on tests at the Chiswick Works skid pan. Footage of RM200 undergoing the skid test at Chiswick was included in the 1971 film On the Buses.|$|E
25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} {{was not only}} the Corvette's first {{production}} year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different. All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors, and black canvas soft tops. Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today. They had <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> but featured a rigid axle supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear. The cost of the first production model Corvettes in 1953 was $3490.|$|E
25|$|First {{production}} run of Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company (Midland Red) buses takes {{place during the}} 1920s—one of the first British buses to have pneumatic tyres. BMMO later develop petrol and diesel engines during the 1930s, with experimental rear-engined buses being built. By the 1940s experiments with, and production of under-floor engined single-deck buses take place. Experiments and developments of <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> air suspension, rubber suspension, glass fibre construction and disc brakes take place during the 1950s. 1959 sees {{the introduction of a}} turbocharged coach capable of almost 100mph, for non-stop motorway services. High speed (motorway) buses are developed with passenger toilets. During the 1960s BMMO becomes the first British bus company to make wide-scale use of computers in compiling bus schedules and staff rosters.|$|E

25|$|Lancia {{is renowned}} in the {{automotive}} world for introducing cars with numerous innovations. These include the Theta of 1913, {{which was the}} first European production car to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment. Lancia's first car adopting a monocoque chassis – the Lambda produced from 1922 to 1931 - featured 'Sliding Pillar' <b>independent</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> that incorporated the spring and hydraulic damper into a single unit (a feature that would be employed in subsequent Lancia's, up to the Appia that was replaced in 1963). 1948 saw the first 5 speed gearbox to be fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia, after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first manufacturer to produce a V4 engine. Other innovations involved the use of independent suspension in production cars (in an era where live axles where common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car) and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia range. This drive for innovation, constant quest for excellence, fixation of quality, complex construction processes and antiqued production machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to increase extensively, while demand did not eventually affecting Lancia's viability.|$|E
500|$|As the 1950s approached, solid front axles {{had been}} {{generally}} replaced with front wheel independent suspension, smoothing the ride considerably and allowing for safer highway speeds.

2500|$|Inspired by styling {{from the}} Dakar and Jeepster concept vehicles, the Liberty was {{intended}} as a replacement for the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and pinion steering. It's also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the [...] 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the [...] 3.7 L V6, as well as a 2.8 L VM Motori turbo diesel (2005-2006 only) for the CRD versions.
