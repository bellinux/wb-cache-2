50|$|Hall {{contributed a}} large amount of work in {{understand}} adolescent development, some of which still holds true today. Hall observed that males tend to have an increase in sensation seeking and aggression during adolescence. Hall also observed an increase in crime rates during the adolescent years. This increase in crime rates have been observed in adolescents today as well. The United States Justice Department released crime statistics on a number of crimes between 1990 and 2010. The statistics show an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> such as drug sales, murder, theft, assault, burglary, etc., for those aged 10 to 18, particularly in males. Hall noted that in terms of aggression there are two types; relational aggression and physical aggression. Relational aggression relates to gossiping, rumor spreading, and exclusions of others. Hall noted that relational aggression occurs more frequently in females while physical aggression occurs more often in males.|$|E

50|$|Janikowski and Betts later disavowed any {{connection}} between housing vouchers and <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the area in a later {{letter to the editor}} for the Atlantic. Rosin failed to mention that there was a consistent decrease and <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> from inner-cities to the inner-ring suburbs across most metropolitan areas due to shifting populations. Anrig argues that economic factors are more likely responsible for Memphis’s <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime,</b> as male unemployment almost doubled between the years of 1990 and 2000. Anrig also makes reference to Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a randomized policy experiment. The study concludes that there was no <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> violent <b>crime</b> for the participants of subsidized housing or their surrounding neighborhoods in the five cities tested; Memphis was {{not a part of the}} study. Even though the participants were far more likely to stay in poorer areas when given the chance to leave, families still received a modest academic and psychological benefit. In fact, according to a paper prepared for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Policy Development and Research rather than increasing crime, those who use housing vouchers are more likely to move into areas where crime is increasing.|$|R

50|$|It is {{the prime}} weapon of choice for Japanese heroes in {{historical}} fiction set before the Meiji period. Carrying a non-sealed katana is illegal in present-day Japan, but in fiction this law is often ignored or circumvented to allow characters to carry katana {{as a matter of}} artistic licence. For instance, some stories state that carrying weapons has been permitted due to a serious <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> or an invasion of monsters from other dimensions. With this law in mind, katana are sometimes used for comic relief in anime and manga set in the present, although this is sometimes replaced by the use of a bokken having surprisingly comparable capabilities. In the film Kill Bill, the main character is permitted to bring her katana on board an airliner; presumably, this is a policy of the fictitious Japanese airline, as other passengers can also be seen carrying swords.|$|E
50|$|From 2003 to 2012, {{there was}} a {{decrease}} in the rate of crime overall, but an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> committed by women. There was an increase in arrest rate for women of 2.9% but a decrease in arrest rate for men of 12.7%. This demonstrates an increase in arrests for women which only slightly offsets the decrease in arrest for men resulting in a decrease overall in arrest rate in the United States. Notably, arrests rates for women had a sizable increase in the following crimes: robbery (+20.2%), larceny-theft (+29.6%), and arson - property crime (+24.7%). The trend results from 2003-2012 showed the vast majority of crimes were still committed by men with around 88% of homicides and 75% of all legal felonies. According to government statistics from the US Department of Justice, male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence. Another report by the US department of Justice on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003-2012 found that 76 percent of domestic violence was committed against women and 24 percent were committed against men.|$|E

In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express [...] "extreme caution" [...] when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of Malmö. However, the leader of the Jewish congregation would have liked the center to consult them before issuing the warning. Fred Khan, the congregation's chairman told Sydvenska Dagbladet suggested that the rise in the crime statistics might not reflect an actual <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> endured by the community over the proceeding year. Members of the congregation do face harassment, but a substantial degree of the incidences remain unreported to the police. In the last year members of the community had been more strongly advised to report all abuse to the police. On June 8, 2012, antisemitic graffiti was spray-painted on the external wall of the old Jewish cemetery in Malmö. The graffiti reads [...] "A PIG" [...] in Swedish (en gris) and a swastika.
