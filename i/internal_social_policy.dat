The new 2 ̆ 7 country-driven 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 comprehensive 2 ̆ 7 focus implies a departure from past development policies and includes room for countries to strengthen <b>internal</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> Ideologically, {{it appears that the}} World Bank has altered its neo-liberal mandate and is shifting toward a more 2 ̆ 7 embedded 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 inclusive 2 ̆ 7 liberal mandate that promotes domestic protections for developing countries.

40|$|The riforma sociale in {{the making}} of an economist: francesco saverio nitti The paper {{attempts}} to trace the character and work of Francesco Saverio Nitti by reflecting on the economic and social contents of the review he founded: "La riforma sociale". The historical period {{is the end of the}} 19 th century, by which the "Giornale degli Economisti" of Antonio de Viti de Marco, Ugo Mazzola and Maffeo Pantaleoni had already established as the principal Italian journal of political economy. "La riforma sociale" was born in the February of 1894 under the initiative of Francesco Saverio Nitti with the aim of containing the dominant liberal thought and reviving a way of making research in the field of economics that may be ascribed to the German Historicism. The paper focuses on the roots of the ideals of Nitti’s review and on the meaning of the disagreement with the "Giornale degli Economisti", on the ground of method, ideology and economic policy. More in detail, the paper considers Nitti’s views on production, distribution and their possible connections; labour protection and social legislation; the relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and international competition; and lastly, regional imbalances and public intervention.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>policy</b> {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} prominent component of the European Union's policy-making responsibilities. Today, for example, a highly developed body of law regulates equal treatment in social security and co-ordinates national security schemes; national health services have opened up to patients and service providers from other states; and rules govern the translation of educational and vocational certificates across member states. This state of affairs {{is all the more}} remarkable given the relatively limited resources at the EU's disposal and the initial intentions of its founders. During negotiations for the Treaty of Rome in the 1950 s, <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> was viewed as the exclusive provenance of the member states. There were to be provisions to facilitate labour mobility within the common market, but until the 1970 s <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> making at the EU-level was modest. However, plans for the <b>internal</b> market moved <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> on the EU's decision-making agenda. The Social Chapter was adopted in 1989, and the Single European Act expanded EU competencies in <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> The Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice all expanded competencies further, so that by the time the heads of government met in Lisbon in 2007 to sign the EU's latest treaty, the extent of supranational control over important aspects of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> making was quite impressive. This important book provides a full account of the evolution of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in the EU and of its current reach. It examines the reasons for the increased role of the EU in the area, in spite of formidable obstacles, and details its effects in member states, where social provision is often the biggest item in government budgets and a crucial issue in national elections. Drawing on research done on welfare states around the world and on European integration, this book provides a distinctive and sophisticated account of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in Europe, showing how it must now be understood in the context of multi-level governance in which EU institutions play a pivotal role...|$|R

This paper discusses this with reference to China and India, with their very distinctive public policy approaches.
