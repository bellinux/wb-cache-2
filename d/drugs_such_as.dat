5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use). Other sedative and analgesic <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E

5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin may {{prolong the}} effects of neuromuscular-blocking <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its {{similarity}} to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means {{they should not be}} given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance.|$|E
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.|$|E

5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> prednisolone and ciclosporin {{if the patient}} is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed {{promise in}} animal trials but failed in clinical trials. These failures {{could be due}} to factors including faults in the trials' design or in the insufficiency of a single agent to prevent the array of injury processes involved in secondary injury.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{recommended}} that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective <b>drugs</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid {{in the treatment}} of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1â€“4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E

5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|In addition, many {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} {{have a specific}} code. For example, several peptide <b>drugs,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Bortezomib and MG132, are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid {{in the analysis of}} protein structure, photo-reactive amino acid analogs are available. These include photoleucine (pLeu) and photomethionine (pMet).|$|E
50|$|Neostigmine {{will cause}} slowing {{of the heart}} rate (bradycardia); for this reason it is usually given along with a parasympatholytic <b>drug</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{atropine}} or glycopyrrolate.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{targeted}} drug delivery: active targeted <b>drug</b> delivery, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> some antibody medications, and passive targeted <b>drug</b> delivery, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR-effect).|$|R
50|$|This {{change is}} {{necessary}} for the protein to be functional. If a <b>drug</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> an antidepressant is bound to it, the transport activity is dramatically reduced.|$|R
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may {{be useful}} as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against {{the contention that}} the use of psilocybin puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders. An analysis of information from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed {{that the use of}} psychedelic <b>drugs</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> psilocybin is associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress, past year suicidal thinking, past year suicidal planning, and past year suicide attempt.|$|E
