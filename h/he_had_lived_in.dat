5|$|By 1876 Gilbert had {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Gloucestershire, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the county {{for the length of}} time required by the rules. In his first season for the club he finished fifth in the first-class batting averages, scoring 907 runs at an average of 36.28. His highest score was 205 not out for an England XI against Cambridge University, the third-highest score of the season after W. G. Grace's two triple centuries. His innings lasted about seven hours, and he batted on each of the three days of the match. This was his maiden first-class century; he scored another hundred later in the season when he made 143 runs for a combined Kent and Gloucestershire side against a team representing England. In the same season he took 28 wickets at an average of 19.64, including seven wickets for 65 runs in the match between the United South of England XI and the United North of England XI.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Cologne {{since at least}} 1437, as only {{those who had been}} living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee. He was obliged to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E
5|$|John Williamson was {{released}} early, in 1955, and deported to England, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the United States {{since the age}} of ten. Irving Potash moved to Poland after his release from prison, then re-entered the United States illegally in 1957, and was arrested and sentenced to two years for violating immigration laws. Robert G. Thompson skipped bail, was captured in 1953, and sentenced to an additional four years. He died in 1965 and U.S. Army officials refused him burial in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife challenged that decision, first losing in U.S. District Court and then winning in the Court of Appeals. Defense attorney George W. Crockett Jr. later became a Democratic congressman from Michigan.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature {{a case in}} which math was used to solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist case in which police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo to assist them in the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist, and Comeaux was arrested.|$|E

25|$|Two other slave cabins {{were built}} from {{materials}} of the First Hermitage.

25|$|His father, Thomas Meagher (1796–1874), was {{a wealthy}} {{merchant}} who had retired to enter politics. He was twice elected Mayor of the City, which he represented in Parliament from August 1847 to March 1857. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the city {{since he was}} a young man, having migrated from Newfoundland in present-day Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{former prime}} {{minister}} Konstantinos Karamanlis was invited back from Paris where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> self-exile since 1963, marking {{the beginning of the}} Metapolitefsi era.

A democratic and republican constitution was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a referendum which chose to not restore the monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Both of Michael's {{paternal}} grandparents originally {{came from}} Hungary, before they migrated to America in the 1940s, {{after the events}} of World War II. Michael himself was born sometime in 1975. As a kid, his grandfather had once taken him on a summer vacation to Hungary. According to the Underworld novelization, prior to moving to Hungary, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Long Island and still had friends there.|$|E
25|$|According to M.N. McDonald, {{who was one}} of the arresting officers, Oswald {{resisted}} {{arrest and}} was attempting to draw his pistol when he was struck and forcibly restrained by the police. He was charged with the murders of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit later that night. Oswald denied shooting anyone and claimed he was a patsy who was arrested because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The English school master George Robert Stowe Mead {{argued in}} 1903 that Jesus had existed, but that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> 100 BCE. Mead based his {{argument}} on the Talmud, which pointed to Jesus being crucified c. 100 BCE. In Mead's view, {{this would mean}} that the Christian gospels are mythical. Tom Harpur has compared Mead's impact on myth theory to that of Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> nearby Ardsley-on-Hudson after {{retiring}} {{from a long}} business career, and worshipped at St. Barnabas. Due to the Schuyler family's prominence within the state, the funeral drew many notable attendees. A special train from the city carried 200 friends, representing many of its esteemed organizations and institutions. J. P. Morgan came on his own train with private car and special locomotive. Joseph Choate and Ogden Mills were also in attendance. The crowd was larger than the church could hold.|$|E
25|$|One of Muawiyah's most {{controversial}} and enduring legacies was {{his decision to}} designate his son Yazid as his successor. Yazid was experienced militarily and had taken part in expeditions and the siege of Constantinople, but he was politically inexperienced. Marwan also wanted Yazid to be the caliph {{so that he could}} run things behind the scenes, as he would become the senior member of the Umayyad clan after Muawiyah's death. Mohammad, Abu Bakr and Umar also mistrusted Marwan, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Taif during their rule, where he became friends with AlHajjaj.|$|E
25|$|The {{veracity}} of both claims {{seems to be}} justified and hence difficult to ascertain. However, most historians agree {{that a majority of}} Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime, as {{he was a member of}} the richer elite classes (he was born in an affluent family, had lived abroad for nearly as long as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines) and wrote primarily in an elite language (at that time, Tagalog and Cebuano were the languages of the masses) about ideals as lofty as freedom (the masses were more concerned about day to day issues like earning money and making a living, something which has not changed much today).|$|E
