40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} galvanic vestibular stimulation applied at 0, 0. 5, 1. 5 and 2. 5 s prior to a backward platform translation on postural responses. The effect of the galvanic stimulation was largest on the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> {{of the center of}} pressure (CoP). The largest effects occurred for the 0. 5 and 0 -s pre-period, when the dynamic CoP pressure changes in response to both the galvanic stimulus and the platform translation coincided. The shift in the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> was also larger than the sum of the shifts for the galvanic stimulus and the platform translation alone for the 0. 5 and 0 -s pre-periods. The initial rate of change of the CoP response to the platform translation was not significantly affected in any condition. Changes in the peak CoP position could be accounted for by local interaction of CoP velocity changes induced by the galvanic and translation responses alone, but the changes in <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> could only be accounted for by a change in global body orientation. These findings suggest that the contribution of vestibulospinal information is greatest during the dynamic phase of the postural response, and that the vestibular system contributes most to the later components of the postural response, particularly to the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b> These findings suggest that a nonlinear interaction between the vestibular signal induced by the galvanic current and the sensory stimuli produced by the platform translation occurs when the two stimuli are presented within 1 s, during the dynamic phase of the postural response to the galvanic stimulus. When presented at greater separations in time, the stimuli appear to be treated as independent events, such that no interaction occurs. Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the generation}} of spatially oriented arm movements by {{the central nervous system}} is that a desired joint position is determined by the ratio of the tensions of agonist and antagonist muscles. According to this hypothesis, the transition between equilibrium states should be solely a function of the contraction time of the motor units and the mechanical properties of the arm. We tested this hypothesis in intact and deafferented rhesus monkeys by holding the forearm and measuring the accelerative transient after release of the forearm and by directly measuring the time course of the increase in torque during the movement. Both methods indicated an average time of 400 msec for attaining peak torque in a movement with a duration of 700 msec. In addition, by displacing the arm from its normal trajectory during the movement., we observed that the arm returned neither to the initial nor to the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions,</b> but to points intermediate between them.

40|$|The {{previous}} paper (Horridge, 1966) {{showed that}} a crab gives a directional eyestalk response to a striped drum which has been moved during a dark period. The crab's ability to do this shows that the former position of the stripes is remembered in some way for many minutes {{in the dark and}} is correlated with the new position on re-illumination. In that paper two aspects were omitted for simplicity. It was assumed that the crab perceives the stripes much as we do as areas of black and white, and that eye tremor can be ignored. In the present account it will be shown that neither of these assumptions is justified, and that both must be modified by one new fact, that eye tremor accentuates the perception of edges.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over "fully-adjusted positions", {{defined by the}} long-run {{equality}} of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition {{of this paper is}} that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the (only possible) long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illustrated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on Lavoie (2002, 2003). A "common language" for the conflicting claims by shareholders, managers, workers and banks is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these contradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate.

Here, a Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods are combined together for predicting the near wall dynamics of particles with different shapes in a laminar flow. For the lattice Boltzmann modelling, a Gauss-Hermite projection is used to derive the lattice equation, wall boundary conditions are imposed through the Zou-He framework, and a moving least squares algorithm accurately reconstructs the forcing term accounting for the immersed boundary. First, the computational code is validated against two well-known test cases: the sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid. A very good agreement is observed between the present results and those available in the literature. Then, the transport of circular, elliptical, rectangular, square and triangular particles is analyzed in a Couette flow, at Re= 20. All particles drifted laterally across the stream lines reaching an equilibrium position, independently of the initial conditions. For this large Reynolds number, the particle shape has no {{significant effect on the}} <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> but it does affect the absolute value and periodicity of the angular velocity. Specifically, elongated particles show longer oscillation periods and, most interestingly, larger variations in angular velocity. The longest particles exhibit a zero angular velocity for almost the whole rotational period. Collectively, this data demonstrates that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically relevant flows. This computational strategy could have significant impact in the field of computational nanomedicine for optimizing the specific delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents...|$|E
40|$|Most {{techniques}} for determining cortisol binding characteristics of transcortin and albumin involve disturbance of the equilibrium between cortisol and binding protein. Only ultrafiltration of undiluted plasma with temperature and pH control allows binding constants {{to be measured}} under near physiological conditions. Equilibrium dialysis is convenient and widely used for investigating cortisol binding but the interpretation ofdata {{has been the subject}} ofcontroversy (Mills, 1962; Tait & Burstein, 1964). The standard method of calculation (Slaunwhite & Sandberg, 1959) is valid only when related to the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b> The derived binding constants refer to cortisol and transcortin concentrations within the sac at the end of dialysis which often differ greatly from those in the original plasma. We describe here a simple method for treatment of dialysis data which, with appropriate correction for dilution, yields binding constants in close accord with those obtained by ultrafiltration of undiluted plasma. Plasmas containing labelled cortisol and tetracycline (50 =m. /ml.) were dialysed against various volumes of phosphate buffer m/ 15, pH 7 - 4, at 37 ° for 16 hr., after preliminary experiments had shown that 10 hr. was sufficient to achieve equilibrium. The same plasmas diluted with the same volumes of phosphate buffer as were used for dialysis were ultrafiltered at 37 ° (Pearson, Keane & Walker, 1967). If Vt ml. plasma is dialysed against V 0 ml. buffer, the dialysate at equilibrium may be regarded as equivalent to an ultrafiltrate and the distribution of cortisol across the membrane should be the same as if V ¡ ml. plasma were diluted with V 0 ml. buffer and the diluted plasma ultrafiltered to give V 0 ml. ultrafiltrate. The cortisol concentration in dialysate and ultrafiltrate should therefore be identical. The experimental verification of this postulate is shown in Table 1.

40|$|The {{existence}} of planets orbiting a central binary star system immediately raises questions regarding their formation and dynamical evolution. Recent discoveries of circumbinary planets by the Kepler space telescope {{has shown that}} some of these planets reside close to the dynamical stability limit where {{it is very difficult to}} form planets in situ. For binary systems with nearly circular orbits, such as Kepler- 38, the observed proximity of planetary orbits to the stability limit can be understood by an evolutionary process in which planets form farther out in the disk and migrate inward to their observed position. The Kepler- 34 system has a high orbital eccentricity of 0. 52. Here, we analyse evolutionary scenarios for the planet observed around this system using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. The highly eccentric binary opens a wide inner hole in the disk which is also eccentric, and displays a slow prograde precession. As a result of the large, eccentric inner gap, an embedded planet settles in a <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> that lies beyond the observed location of Kepler- 34 b, but has the correct eccentricity. In this configuration the planetary orbit is aligned with the disk in a state of apsidal corotation. To account for the closer orbit of Kepler- 34 b to the central binary, we considered a two-planet scenario and examined the evolution of the system through joint inward migration and capture into mean-motion resonances. When the inner planet orbits inside the gap of the disk, planet-planet scattering ensues. While often one object is thrown into a large, highly eccentric orbit, at times the system is left with a planet close to the observed orbit, suggesting that Kepler 34 might have had two circumbinary planets where one might have been scattered out of the system or into an orbit where it did not transit the central binary during the operation of Kepler.

40|$|Microfluidic {{processes}} for chemical synthesis have become popular in recent years. The small {{scale of the}} chemical reactions promise greater control over reaction conditions and more timely creation of products. The small scale of microfluidics poses {{its own set of}} problems, however. At the microscale, the dominant fluid forces are viscous resistance and surface tension. The effects of viscosity and scale reduce the Reynolds number and make mixing difficult. Much work has been done to control mixing at the microscale. This problem is concerned with a different microfluidic problem: delivering reactants to the site of reaction. A common setup is to attach syringes full of reactant to a reaction chamber by narrow hydrophobic tubing. Using a stepper motor, a controlled dose of liquid may be injected into the tube. The hydrophobosity causes the dose to curve outward on the sides, becoming a "slug" of reactant with air in front and behind. The syringe at the rear is then switched for one full of air, and air pressure is used to drive the slug to the reaction site. If too much pressure is applied, the slug will arrive with a significant back pressure that will be relieved through bubbling in the reaction site. This causes the formation of a foam and is highly undesirable. We present a simple model based on Boyle’s law for the motion of a slug through a tube. We then extend this model for trains of slugs separated by air bubbles. Last, we consider the case of a flooded reaction site, where the forward air bubble must be pushed through the flooding liquid. In conclusion, we have determined the dynamics of a single slug moving towards an empty reaction chamber giving the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> of the slug. A phase-plane analysis then determined a condition {{on the size of the}} slug needed to ensure that it comes to rest without oscillating about the equilibrium position. The effect of a flooded reaction chamber was then considered. In this case it is impossible to avoid bubbling due to the design of the device. We found that it is possible, however, to reduce the bubbling by minimising the back pressure behind the slug. Finally, the dynamics of multiple slugs with or without a flooded reaction chamber has been investigated...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the dynamic response analyses and extreme value problems of moored floating platforms. It {{can be divided into}} three major subjects: first, the analysis of single cables and cable induced mooring damping; second, the dynamic analysis of the moored platforms, with special emphasis on the damping mechanisms and generation of the low-frequency excitation force time series; and third, the extreme wave-frequency responses and the combination of the low-frequency and wave-frequency extreme responses. The catenary equation or shooting method can be used to obtain an initial estimation of the mooring cable configuration in calm water, after which non-linear static analysis is performed to find the <b>final</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> considering cable weight, current force and seabed friction. Around this equilibrium configuration, either a non-linear time-domain step-by-step integration or a linearized frequency domain analysis can be carried out to determine the response of the cable to various excitations. For the frequency-domain analysis, direct integration and statistic linearization methods are implemented. Example calculations show that the linearized frequency-domain solution and non-linear time-domain solution compare well with each other as well as with model tests and results obtained by others. We improve the quality and extend the applications of Huse's original quasi-static approach of estimating mooring-cable induced damping. By doing so, we could use the quasi-static approach to obtain an estimation of the mooring-cable induced damping that is comparable to the more time-consuming and complex time-domain or frequency-domain approaches. The dynamic response of moored floating platforms to wave-frequency and low-frequency wave excitations is described. Formulae for low-frequency excitations are presented in both the time-domain and the frequency-domain. Four damping mechanisms for moored platforms are reviewed, with emphasis on mooring-cable induced damping, wave-drift damping and viscous damping, which are important for low-frequency response. The commonly used methods of generating wave-frequency and low-frequency excitation time series are discussed, and a one-dimensional convolution approach is proposed. In this approach, a random signal is passed through a filter, the filter coefficients are determined from the low-frequency excitation spectrum and the random signal follows the theoretical probability density function of low-frequency excitations. The usual way of estimating the extreme mooring cable tensions is to run many time-domain simulations, which is rather time-consuming. Here however, only one or a few simulations plus the extreme value theory are needed to predict the extreme mooring cable tension. The order statistic theory, the generalised extreme value theory and the peaks-over-threshold methods are applied. A new approach is proposed to estimate the correlation coefficient between the low-frequency and wave-frequency extreme responses. This coefficient can then be used when we estimate the total combined platform motion or mooring cable tension...|$|E
