25|$|Sukhdev Singh Sukha was {{a member}} of the <b>Khalistan</b> Commando Force and one of the assassins of Arun Vaidya, the Chief of Indian army at the time of Operation Blue Star and also the {{architect}} of Operation Blue Star. He was responsible for three high-profile killings; Arjan Dass, Lalit Maken and Gen. Vaidya. He along with other members of <b>Khalistan</b> Commando Force (including its chief General Labh Singh) was involved in the bank robbery in Miller Gunj branch (in Ludhiana) of the Punjab National Bank in which more than Rs 57.0million were looted.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} deeply {{involved}} in the training, guiding and arming Sikh militants. Wadhawa Singh, Chief Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), Lakhbir Singh Rode, Chief, International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), Paramjit Singh Panjwar, Chief, <b>Khalistan</b> Commando Force (KCF), Gajinder Singh, Chief, Dal Khalsa International (DKI) and Ranjit Singh Neeta, Chief, <b>Khalistan</b> Zindabad Force (KZF) permanently based in Pakistan, have been co-ordinating militant activities of their outfits in Punjab and elsewhere in India under the guidance of Pak ISI. Pak ISI agents regularly escort Sikh militants for trans-border movement and provide safe havens for their shelter and dumps for weapons and explosives.|$|E

25|$|In June 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi {{ordered an}} attack on Sikh separatists {{belonging}} to the <b>Khalistan</b> movement who had {{holed up in the}} Golden Temple in Amritsar. The operation resulted in 500-1,500 civilian deaths and heavy damage to the Akal Takht.|$|E
25|$|However, by this time, DMK {{had taken}} over from DK as the main bearer of the separatist theme. Unlike <b>Khalistan</b> and other separatist {{movements}} in Republic of India, DMK never considered violence as a serious option to achieve a separate Dravida Nadu.|$|E
25|$|He did {{his early}} {{schooling}} {{from his native}} village and village 13 FF Manaksar. In 1983 he received his BA from Gian Joti College in Karanpur and was studying in MA English when Operation Bluestar occurred. He also left his studies and joined the <b>Khalistan</b> separatist movement.|$|E
25|$|The main {{suspects}} in the bombing were members of a Sikh separatist group called the Babbar Khalsa (banned in Europe and the United States as a proscribed terrorist group) and other related groups {{who were at the}} time agitating for a separate Sikh state called <b>Khalistan</b> in Punjab, India.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s {{witnessed}} some Sikh groups {{seeking an}} independent nation named <b>Khalistan</b> carved out from India and Pakistan. The Golden Temple and Akal Takht were occupied by various militant groups in early 1980s. These included the Dharam Yudh Morcha led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Babbar Khalsa, the AISSF and the National Council of <b>Khalistan.</b> Between 1982 and 1983, there were <b>Khalistan</b> demand-related terrorist attacks against civilians {{in parts of}} India. By late 1983, the Bhindranwale led group had begun to build bunkers and observations posts {{in and around the}} Golden Temple, with militants involved in weapons training. In June 1984, the then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Indian Army to begin Operation Blue Star against the militants. The operation caused severe damaged and destroyed Akal Takht. Numerous soldiers, civilians and militants died in the cross fire. Within days of the Operation Bluestar, some 2,000 Sikh soldiers in India mutinied and attempted to reach Amritsar to liberate the Golden Temple. Within six months, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards assassinated her. The assassination triggered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. According to Donald Horowitz, while anti-Sikh riots led to much damage and deaths, many serious provocations by militants also failed to trigger ethnic violence in many cases throughout the 1980s. The Sikhs and their neighbors, for most part, ignored attempts to provoke riots and communal strife.|$|E
25|$|On 3â€“6 June 1984, the <b>Khalistan</b> {{movement}} was sparked into action as Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Operation Blue Star, the storming of the Golden Temple. Militants led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (who {{was killed in}} the attack) had amassed weapons in the Sikh temple. The militants demanded that Sikhs not be treated as second class citizens in India and demanded equality through changes in the Indian constitution or otherwise the creation of a Sikh state, <b>Khalistan.</b> Some independent estimates of the death toll of the operation ran as high as 1500 civilian deaths, which led to an uproar among Sikhs worldwide. On 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. In retaliation, 1984 anti-Sikh riots, guided by certain Indian National Congress members, killed thousands of Sikhs in India.|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} Sikhs turned to militancy in Punjab; some Sikh militant groups aimed {{to create an}} {{independent}} state called <b>Khalistan</b> through acts of violence directed at members of the Indian government, army or forces. Others demanded an autonomous state within India, based on the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. A large numbers of Sikhs condemned {{the actions of the}} militants.|$|E
25|$|Surjan Singh Gill {{was living}} in Vancouver as the self-proclaimed {{consul-general}} of <b>Khalistan.</b> Some RCMP testimony claimed he was a mole who left the plot just days before its execution because {{he was told to}} pull out, but the Canadian government denied that report. He later fled Canada and is believed to be in hiding in London, England.|$|E
25|$|The most {{affected}} regions were neighbourhoods in Delhi. Human rights organisations and the newspapers believe the massacre was organised. The collusion of political {{officials in the}} massacres {{and the failure to}} prosecute any killers alienated normal Sikhs and increased support for the <b>Khalistan</b> movement. The Akal Takht, the governing religious body of Sikhism, considers the killings to be a genocide.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} {{developments in the}} 1980s such as the militant <b>Khalistan</b> movement, the influx of undocumented Bangladeshi immigration into Assam, Muslim mobilisation in the Shah Bano case {{as well as the}} Satanic Verses controversy caused a sense of vulnerability among the Hindus in India. The VHP and the BJP utilised this sense of vulnerability to push forward a militant Hindutva nationalist agenda leading to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP officially adopted Hindutva as its ideology in its 1989 Palampur resolution, reversing the 1951 move of its original founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee. This led to the unlawful demolition of the Babri Masjid by rioters in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The temple is spiritually {{the most}} {{significant}} shrine in Sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s. In the early 1980s, the temple became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a militant movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking {{to carve out a}} new nation named <b>Khalistan</b> from parts of India and Pakistan. In 1984, Gandhi sent in the army, leading to numerous deaths of militants, soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the temple and the destruction of Akal Takht. The temple complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in Punjab deteriorated into anarchy with {{a rise in}} government correuption and police brutality. By the early 1990s, {{after many years of}} violence across Punjab, the activists' struggle for <b>Khalistan</b> had lost much of the sympathy given after the assault on the Golden Temple due to mass Indian media propagating nationalism against the cause, and what little armed resistance remained was eliminated and forced underground. In the following years there was concern over the apparent human rights abuses conducted by the central and state government against Sikhs, many of them innocent civilians, and many human rights organisations were not allowed in the Punjab at the time, and some are not even allowed there to this day.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{a group of}} Sikh activists started a {{movement}} to demand {{the completion of the}} Anandpur Sahib resolution. Discord developed after the rejection of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. Sikhs demanded an independent state of <b>Khalistan.</b> A number of militants allegedly targeted officials and people opposed to their point of view. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwala, a Sikh leader, with help from Shabeg Singh heavily fortified the temple to resist Indian forces, who had planned to assault and invade the Golden Temple two years previously. The Indian army finally assaulted the Golden Temple, allegedly to take out armed militants in June 1984. However, the operation, Operation Blue Star resulted in the death of several civilians and has been deemed the beginning of the Sikh genocide.|$|E
25|$|The ISI {{was created}} after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, {{due to the}} Military Intelligence of Pakistan's (MI) weak performance. When Zia-ul-Haq seized power in July 1977, he started his K2 (Kashmir and <b>Khalistan)</b> strategy, {{initiating}} Operation Tupac. He gave ISI the duty to make Jammu and Kashmir a part of Pakistan, and to send terrorists to Punjab. According to arrested ISI agents, the intelligence agency's aims are to confound Indian Muslims using Kashmiri Muslims, extend the ISI network in India, cultivate terrorists and terrorist groups, cause attacks similar to the 1993 Bombay bombings in other cities, and create a state of insurgency in Muslim-dominated regions. The ISI has allegedly set up bases in Nepal and Bangladesh, which are used for operations in North-East India.|$|E

25|$|Assuming the {{presidency}} in 1978, Zia {{played a major role}} in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Aided by the United States and Saudi Arabia, Zia systematically coordinated the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet occupation throughout the 1980s. This culminated in the Soviet Union's withdrawal in 1989, but also led to the proliferation of millions of refugees, with heroin and weaponry into Pakistan's frontier province. On the foreign front, Zia also bolstered ties with China, the European Economic Community, the United States, and emphasised Pakistan's role in the Islamic world, while relations with India worsened amid the Siachen conflict and accusations that Pakistan was aiding the <b>Khalistan</b> movement. Domestically, Zia passed broad-ranging legislation as part of Pakistan's Islamization, acts criticised for fomenting religious intolerance. He also escalated Pakistan's atomic bomb project, and instituted industrialisation and deregulation, helping Pakistan's economy become among the fastest-growing in South Asia. Averaged over Zia's rule, GDP growth was the highest in the country's history.|$|E
25|$|General Arun Vaidya was the Chief of the Indian Army {{who ordered}} {{the attack on}} the holiest of the Sikh shrines at Amritsar and {{elsewhere}} in Punjab during Operation Blue Star. He had moved to Pune after his retirement from the army. On 10 August 1986 General Arun Vaidya, the architect of Operation Blue Star was shot to death by Jinda and Sukha while he was driving his car home from the market. According to the police, the assailants pulled up next to his car on motor scooters and fired eight or nine shots into the car. Vaidya reportedly died instantly of head and neck wounds. His wife, who was also in the car, was wounded by four bullets in her back and thighs. According to Indian intelligence sources, Vaidya had been the number four assassination target on lists by Sikh militants {{and he was one of}} several people killed in retaliation for Operation Blue Star. Following the assassination, the <b>Khalistan</b> Commando Force issued a statement declaring that Vaidya had been killed in retaliation for the Golden Temple operation.|$|E
25|$|Snatch {{operations}} with IB: In late 2009, investigative journal The Week ran {{a cover story}} on one of India's major clandestine operations that the R ran with Intelligence Bureau to nab terrorists infiltrating India, via Nepal and other neighbouring countries. To bypass the lengthy extradition process, R conducts snatch operations to nab suspects from various foreign countries. The suspect is brought to India, interrogated in black sites, later shown as arrested at an airport or border post and is usually produced before a court. With emergence of Nepal as a terror transit point R and the IB started closely monitoring the movement of suspected terrorists in Nepal. According to The Week, in last decade there has been close to 400 successful snatch operations conducted by R and/or IB in Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries. Some famous snatches netted Bhupinder Singh Bhuda of the <b>Khalistan</b> Commando Force, Lashkar militant Tariq Mehmood and Abdul Karim Tunda, Sheikh Abdul Khwaja, one of the handlers of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Yasin Bhatkal founder leader of the proscribed terrorist organisation Indian Mujahideen etc. most of the suspects are kept at Tihar Jail.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after Chauhan {{returned}} to India, {{he started a}} political party named the Khalsa Raj Party, apparently {{with the aim of}} propagating the cause of <b>Khalistan</b> through peaceful means. In a 2004 interview he claimed that <b>Khalistan</b> will be formed in 2007. When asked, [...] "Has the recognition by the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation [...] at the Hague given a boost to the movement?", he said, [...] "Yes.

Other quotes attributed to Bhindranwale on <b>Khalistan</b> include [...] "we are not in favour of <b>Khalistan</b> nor are we against it". Responding to the formation of <b>Khalistan</b> he is quoted as saying, [...] "I don't oppose it nor do I support it. We are silent. However, one thing is definite that if this time the Queen of India does give it to us, we shall certainly take it. We won't reject it. We shall not repeat the mistake of 1946. As yet, we do not ask for it. It is Indira Gandhi's business and not mine, nor Longowal's, nor of any other of our leaders. It is Indira's business. Indira should tell us whether she wants to keep us in Hindustan or not. We like to live together, we like to live in India."

2500|$|Though {{journalist}} Khushwant Singh believed {{himself to}} be on Bhindranwale's hit list, he allowed that the Sikh preacher-become-activist genuinely made no distinction between higher and lower castes, {{and that he had}} restored thousands of drunken or doped Sikh men, inured to pornographic films, to their families, and that Operation Blue Star had given the movement for <b>Khalistan</b> its first martyr in Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 2003, at a function arranged by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, at Akal Takhat Amritsar under the vision of president SGPC Prof. Kirpal Singh Badungar and Singh Sahib Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti, former jathedar of the Akal Takht made a formal declaration that Bhindranwale was a [...] "martyr" [...] and awarded his son, Ishar Singh, a robe of honour.

2500|$|Sikhs participated {{and contributed}} to the decades-long Indian {{independence}} movement from the colonial rule {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the land was partitioned into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history. The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line ("Radcliffe line"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the Muslim League demands and saw it as [...] "perpetuation of Muslim domination" [...] and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community. In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of Komagata Maru in Canada proposed the idea of <b>Khalistan</b> as a buffer state between Pakistan and India. These leaders, however, were largely ignored. Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.|$|E
2500|$|While the Congress {{had insisted}} for an India which was united and the Muslim League {{asked for a}} {{separate}} country, Sikh leader Dr. Vir Singh Bhatti proposed {{the creation of a}} separate Sikh state [...] "Khalistan". Sikh leaders who were unanimous in their opposition to Pakistan wanted a Sikh state to be created. Master Tara Singh wanted the right for an independent <b>Khalistan</b> to federate with either Hindustan or Pakistan. However, the Sikh state being proposed was for an area where no religion was in absolute majority. Negotiations for the independent Sikh state had commenced at the end of World War II and the British initially agreed but the Sikhs withdrew this demand after pressure from Indian nationalists. The proposals of the Cabinet Mission Plan had seriously jolted the Sikhs because while both the Congress and League could be satisfied the Sikhs saw nothing in it for themselves. as they would be subjected to a Muslim majority. Master Tara Singh protested this to Pethic-Lawrence on May 5. By early September the Sikh leaders accepted both the long term and interim proposals despite their earlier rejection. The Sikhs attached themselves to the Indian state with the promise of religious and cultural autonomy.|$|E

The Soviet-Afghan jihad and the Islamic Revolution in Iran were {{becoming}} sources of inspiration for large numbers of Kashmiri Muslim youth. The state authorities responded with increasing use of brute force to simple economic demands. Both the pro-Independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the pro-Pakistan Islamist groups including JIJK mobilised the fast growing anti-Indian sentiments among the Kashmiri population. 1984 saw a pronounced rise in terrorist violence in Kashmir. When Kashmir Liberation Front militant Maqbool Bhat was executed in February 1984, strikes and protests by Kashmiri nationalists {{broke out in the}} region. Large numbers of Kashmiri youth participated in widespread anti India demonstrations, which faced heavy handed reprisals by Indian state forces. Critics of the then Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, charged that Abdullah was losing control. His visit to Pakistan administered Kashmir became an embarrassment, where according to Hashim Qureshi, he shared a platform with Kashmir Liberation Front. Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf on Indira Gandhi and his father, so that sentiments there could [...] "be known first hand", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed <b>Khalistan</b> terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On July 2, 1984, Ghulam Mohammad Shah, who had support from Indira Gandhi, replaced his brother-in-law Farooq Abdullah and became the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, after Abdullah was dismissed, in what was termed as a political [...] "coup".|$|E
