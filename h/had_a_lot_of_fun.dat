5|$|In interviews, Garcia, Dae Kim, and Holloway {{commented that}} they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> {{shooting}} their scenes, {{as they had}} not worked together for a while. The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. It first aired on February 28, 2007, in the United States on ABC, with an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews, with many praising its humor but still noting that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+". He {{felt that the}} plot {{revolving}} around downsizing was [...] "fitting", because the episode takes place on [...] "Halloween", and that this plot returned Michael {{to the role of}} villain. Adams also felt that [...] "director Paul Feig and credited writer Greg Daniels <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> dressing the show up for “Halloween,” framing Dwight like a shrouded Emperor Palpatine and making John Krasinski step into Steve Carell’s shoes for a couple of great punchlines." ...|$|E

[...] "We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> laughed a lot and {{had a great time}} in general when he was with May Pang.

500|$|John Noble {{talked about}} the episode in an {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, [...] "This is part of the risk-taking that our creators will go for. It hadn’t been done before. We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> doing it. Then we had {{to get him out of}} it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E

500|$|Conan {{received}} fair-to-good {{ratings from}} critics. In 2008, review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings selected around 80 reviews and calculated average scores of 69 (out of 100) and 70% for the game, respectively. [...] Most critics {{agreed that the}} game's best selling point was its variety in combat. [...] They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> with its easy-to-learn controls, skill customization, and most of all, the varied brutal depictions of Conan's kills. [...] TeamXbox said that the combat system [...] "blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user (with gore) for pressing the right buttons at the right time". The pounding, militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics' experience with the game.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "came close to {{fulfilling}} [...] potential, {{but was unable to}} keep the rapid-fire comedic pace going for the entire episode." [...] He added that {{the second half of the}} show was not [...] "a complete loss, but, man, that first act just steamrolled viewers with hilarious bit after hilarious bit." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide thought that the [...] "unexpected treat this week was guest star James Carville, who's presence as confidant to Jack not only made sense, but Carville also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> lampooning himself 'Cajun style' and all.

500|$|Lennon's {{relationship}} with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to Manhattan in 1971, Julian {{would not see}} his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls {{that he and his}} father [...] "got on a great deal better" [...] during the time he spent in New York: [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> laughed a lot and had a great time in general." ...|$|E

500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring. Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist so I had to put one more album out.

500|$|Despite {{previous}} {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy's recent retirement, the writers still had plot lines concerning his character William Bell. Some {{months prior to}} the airing of [...] "Stowaway", Nimoy and others had noted that Bell's character would return to Fringe. Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, [...] "This is not one I had been asking for!" [...] To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented [...] "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were really smart.

500|$|The ancient {{language}} {{used by the}} elves in Eragon is based [...] "almost entirely" [...] on Old Norse, German, Anglo Saxon, and Russian myth. Paolini commented: [...] " [...] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> with that." [...] Picking the right names for the characters and places was a process that could take [...] "days, weeks, or even years". Paolini said: [...] "if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself." [...] He added that he was [...] "really lucky" [...] with the name Eragon, [...] "because it's just dragon with one letter changed." [...] Also, Paolini commented that he thought of both parts of the name [...] "Eragon" [...] - [...] "era" [...] and [...] "gone" [...] - as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives. [...] He thought the name fit the book perfectly, {{but some of the}} other names caused him [...] "real headaches".|$|E

500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that {{it was almost as if}} Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E
500|$|According to Scully, [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{is often}} cited by fans of The Simpsons {{as one of the}} worst episodes ever because of its {{structure}} and outlandish nature. Scully has said that the episode is [...] "kind of three stories in one." [...] Meyer, a writer and producer on the show, said in the DVD audio commentary that the fans thought it was [...] "kind of a frenetic and crazy, chaotic episode," [...] adding: [...] "I can't disagree. But we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> writing it, and we stand by it." [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: [...] "Wow – this may be the most jumbled Simpsons to date! The episode seems to suffer from ADD as it can’t focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense – or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it’s too scattershot to succeed." [...] Annie Alleman of The Herald News, on the other hand, named [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] her eighth favorite Simpsons episode. Nancy Basile of About.com thought the best scene of the episode is the one where the Simpsons have become hillbillies and are sitting on their porch, and Bart says [...] "I'm getting used to this country life. Teacher says I'm whittling at a tenth-grade level." [...] Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed Kid Rock at number one in his list of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy.

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will {{have to wait and see}} who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
