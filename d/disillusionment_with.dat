5|$|All of {{the native}} tribes {{experienced}} gradual <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. government because of its inability or unwillingness to honor its treaty commitments. The major leaders among the tribes were Wabasha and Little Crow among the Dakota Sioux, Flat Mouth and Hole-in-the-Day among the Ojibwe, and Winneshiek among the Winnebago. The success of treaty negotiations between the U.S. and the tribes was in great part facilitated by the mixed race families such as the Faribaults and the Renvilles.|$|E
5|$|Damon {{appeared}} on Hardball with Chris Matthews in December 2006, and while discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, {{expressed concern about}} inequities across socioeconomic classes with regard to who in the United States is tasked with the responsibility of fighting wars. Damon is {{a supporter of the}} Democratic Party, and has made several critical statements against Republican Party figures, but has also expressed his <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the policies of President Barack Obama. In 2012, Damon, Ben Affleck, and John Krasinski hosted a fundraiser for Democratic Senate nominee Elizabeth Warren.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} before his death, {{he was dealing with}} two pending lawsuits, one a {{paternity}} case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{involvement}} with Cape politics led her into an association with Cecil John Rhodes, {{with whom she}} would soon become disillusioned and about whom she would write her bitterly satirical allegory Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland. This <b>disillusionment</b> began <b>with</b> his support of the [...] "strop bill" [...] that would allow black and coloured servants to be flogged for relatively small offences.|$|R
5000|$|Don't Tell a Soul {{received}} generally favorable reviews, with critics {{noting the}} music's more mature themes and increasing <b>disillusionment,</b> along <b>with</b> a more private outlook. Ira Robbins of Rolling Stone praised Westerberg's writing, stating that Don't Tell a Soul [...] "is full of his sharp-tongued wordplay and idiosyncratic musical structures." [...] In February 1990, {{the album was}} ranked at number 16 in The Village Voices 1989 Pazz & Jop critics' poll.|$|R
50|$|The last {{decades have}} seen a process of {{partisan}} dealignment in many countries as voters become less connected to their political party. This dealignment shows that short term factors might play a larger role than usual in whether a candidate receives a vote from someone of their party. Several factors {{can be attributed to}} partisan dealignment, such as a greater political awareness and socialisation, intensive mass media coverage and decline of deference; <b>disillusionment</b> both <b>with</b> parties and politicians, and most importantly, the poor performance of government.|$|R
5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|The FVdG's <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> {{the social}} {{democratic}} movement deepened during the mass strike debate. The role of the general strike for the socialist movement was first discussed within the FVdG in 1901. At the SPD's 1903 congress in Dresden, Raphael Friedeberg proposed discussing the topic, but his proposal {{was rejected by the}} congress. The following year, a proposal by Wilhelm Liebknecht and Eduard Bernstein to initiate debate on the topic was accepted, since they had distanced themselves from Friedeberg's positions.|$|E
5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his {{personal}} relationships and <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the music industry had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, she found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
50|$|As Polish {{persecution}} of Ukrainians during the interwar period increased, many Ukrainians (particularly the youth, {{many of whom}} felt they had no future) lost faith in traditional legal approaches, in their elders, and in the western democracies who were seen as turning their backs on Ukraine. This period of <b>disillusionment</b> coincided <b>with</b> the increase in support for the OUN. By {{the beginning of the}} Second World War, the OUN was estimated to have 20,000 active members and many times that number in sympathizers. Many bright students, such as the talented young poets Bohdan Kravtsiv and Olena Teliha (executed by the Nazis at Babi Yar) were attracted to the OUN's revolutionary message.|$|R
5000|$|These loyalist {{attacks were}} responded to in kind by the IRA (sometimes using the cover name Republican Action Force or similar), with {{the months that}} {{followed}} the Bayardo attack being characterised as a bloody game of tit-for-tat. This was met <b>with</b> <b>disillusionment</b> by imprisoned republicans such as Gerry Adams and Brendan Hughes, with the latter claiming that sectarianism was [...] "destroying the whole struggle".|$|R
50|$|After the war, he {{reflected}} the widespread <b>disillusionment</b> in Belgium <b>with</b> German culture, while taking a nuanced position which {{allowed him to}} criticize German nationalism without excluding German works from the scholarly canon. His earlier belief in the inevitable progress of humanity collapsed, so he began to accept chance or the fortuitous in history and came to acknowledge the significance of single great individuals at certain points in history.|$|R
5|$|In 1923 {{his first}} book, How Labour Governs, was {{published}} by the London Labour Company. Examining the Australian Labor Party and its wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as {{a major player in}} British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French {{authorities}} discovered pacifying northern Syria was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region. Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland, but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria, following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed. <b>Disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding Syria made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists. In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
50|$|Tirumalesh's {{career as}} a writer began in the 1960s when he wrote the {{collection}} of poems MukhavaaDagalu (Masks, 1968) in the Navya style, the modernist school of writing in Kannada literature. His Mahaprasthana (1990) {{was said to be}} the result of his exploration of ways of transcending the constraints of modernism. It dealt with the theme of <b>disillusionment</b> after victory, <b>with</b> the mythological heavenward journey of the Pandavas as the setting.|$|R

50|$|Jack Johnson, an inventive genius, {{was one of}} {{the first}} African Americans to break the color barrier in the toy {{manufacturing}} industry in the early 1960s, winning a job with the Whamco corporation. Though he faced pay discrimination in comparison to his white colleagues, his true <b>disillusionment</b> came <b>with</b> the discovery that Whamco was exploiting his inventions for criminal purposes. His protests merely resulted in the termination of his employment in 1964, together with the kidnapping of his father to ensure his silence. Jack fought back by adapting his inventions into a personal arsenal and taking on the secret identity of the clown-costumed hero Jack-in-the-Box, in which guise he freed his father and other hostages and eventually exposed Whamco's criminal operations. By this time an established superhero, he continued his double life.|$|R
5|$|John Ronald Skirth (11 December 1897 – 1977) was a British {{soldier who}} served in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. His {{experiences}} during the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele, both in 1917, led him to resolve not to take human life, {{and for the rest of}} his army service he made deliberate errors in targeting calculations to try to ensure the guns of his battery missed their aiming point on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. Many years later, after retiring from a career as a teacher, he wrote a memoir of his years in the army, describing his <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the conduct of the war and his conversion to pacifism. In 2010 the memoir was published as The Reluctant Tommy, edited by Duncan Barrett.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his <b>disillusionment</b> <b>with</b> and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E

50|$|Historians Simon Dubnow, Yitzhak Gruenbaum, Frank Golczewski and Magdalena Micinska, among others, {{noted that}} the pogrom might have been instigated by the Russian authorities, trying to {{drive a wedge between}} Jews and Poles or show that pogroms, {{increasingly}} common in Russian Empire after the assassination of the tsar Alexander II in 1881 (in that period over 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in Russian Empire, notably the Kiev and Odessa pogroms), were not a Russia-only phenomena. However historian Michael Ochs disagreed with this explanation, citing insufficient evidence. Ochs calls those explanations conspiracy theories, arguing that they fail to present what the Russian authorities would have gained from the pogroms. He notes that period from 1863 to 1881 was witnessing the increase of anti-Semitism in Poland, <b>with</b> <b>disillusionment</b> among Poles <b>with</b> the idea of assimilation of the Jews was growing, and hence there was less need for the Russian authorities to orchestrate a pogrom, which might have been spontaneous. However, Ochs explanation doesn't take into account numerous, evidenced examples of riots and murders instigated by the Russian Ochrana (secret police) in occupied Poland after the Tsar's assassination in 1881.|$|R
60|$|Many persons, {{themselves}} city-bred and city-reared, {{have fled}} to the soil and succeeded in winning great happiness. In such cases they have succeeded only by going {{through a process of}} savage <b>disillusionment.</b> But <b>with</b> Dede and Daylight it was different. They had both been born on the soil, and they knew its naked simplicities and rawer ways. They were like two persons, after far wandering, who had merely come home again. There was less of the unexpected in their dealings with nature, while theirs was all the delight of reminiscence. What might appear sordid and squalid to the fastidiously reared, was to them eminently wholesome and natural. The commerce of nature was to them no unknown and untried trade. They made fewer mistakes. They already knew, and it was a joy to remember what they had forgotten.|$|R
