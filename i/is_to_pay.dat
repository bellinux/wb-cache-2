Those with a higher income <b>were</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they <b>are</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families <b>are</b> not willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people <b>are</b> lesser willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R
