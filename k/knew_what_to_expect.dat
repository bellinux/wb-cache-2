5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect,</b> and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through {{the glare of the}} stage lights, was worried that the crowd might {{be on the verge of}} rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E

[...] By {{the end of the}} tour's first year, U2 had won over many fans. In a 1992 end-of-year poll, readers of Q voted U2 [...] "The Best Act in the World Today". The band's almost clean sweep of Rolling Stones end-of-year readers' poll—which included [...] "Best Artist", [...] "Best Tour", and Bono as [...] "Sexiest Male Artist"—reconfirmed for the magazine they were the [...] "world's biggest rock band".|$|E

500|$|When {{working with}} other {{producers}} usually {{a majority of the}} track was already done {{by the time he got}} to the recording studio, but with West, the process was more creative in nature. Pusha described the recording process with West as a [...] "roller coast" [...] and stated that he never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> while working with the producer. Upon hearing the production of the song, Pusha-T commented that it was so good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse. On the production of [...] "So Appalled", he said [...] "it's Kanye, the beat brings the ghost out of you." [...] The rapper described his verse as [...] "self-explanatory" [...] and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career. Pusha T called his verse [...] "his personal favorite" [...] and that the track was originally supposed to be just him and Kanye. When the song was finished, Pusha-T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album, stating that the song was so good it didn't matter whether or not it had leaked. He commented; ...|$|E

Though {{she enjoyed}} the a cappella cover, Brissey found it incongruous in context, opining that Glee best {{performances}} are those {{linked to the}} storylines, allowing viewers to invest in their message. Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself, including Mullins, Futterman and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson. Tucker felt that it had [...] "more snap and vigour" [...] than the final number, but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion, writing that it impacted negatively on the episode's momentum. Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review, suggesting {{that it should have}} been the episode's opening number and lauding it as [...] "surprising, oozing with charm, and actually kind of joyous." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the [...] "completely random and bizarre" [...] song choice, writing that it reminded her of the first season, [...] "when [...] never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> and [...] was often happily surprised." [...] Reiter too reviewed it favorably, calling it the best performance of the show. She appreciated the focus on facial expressions during the performance, in contrast to the elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Freed by Morpheus, {{crew member}} of the Nebuchadnezzar, Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe {{she had to do}} the extreme acrobatic actions as {{described}} in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them. Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> subsequently. The role made Moss, who later said that [...] "I had no career before. None." [...] Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it. In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the 'Intro' and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Bomis {{planned to}} make Wikipedia a {{profitable}} business. Sanger initially saw Wikipedia {{primarily as a}} tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that, at worst, it might produce [...] "complete rubbish". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, {{who came up with the}} broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the Wikipedia initiative. Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement. Wales has said that he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awaken during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project. In a talk at SXSW in 2016, he recalled that he wrote the first words on Wikipedia: [...] "Hello world", a phrase computer programmers often use to test new software.|$|E
2500|$|In the First Test Keith Miller dug {{the ball}} in short and [...] "nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high". “Edrich batted for 105 minutes. He {{suffered}} more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller". Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich [...] "were hit on the body repeatedly". Miller used a limited leg-trap some of the time, but he quickly slowed his pace as on the rain-affected pitch the ball leapt {{so much that it}} could hit the batsman, but not get them out. One English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Clif Cary wrote that [...] "the placements were sufficient to cause the batsmen worry, although they did not justify one journalist describing the attack as [...] "bodyline" [...] to lend colour and expression to his cable". The England bowler Bill Voce and the reporter Bill Bowes did not comment on the matter, but Harold Larwood said that Bodyline was less dangerous as the batsman <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> - bouncers on the leg-stump - but here they could get anything.|$|E
