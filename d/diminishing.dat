5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} <b>diminishing</b> number of varieties of a <b>diminishing</b> number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or {{as in the case}} of the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help of seed banks, international organizations are working to preserve crop diversity.|$|E

50|$|Various crossed pentagrammic cupolae on the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron may be <b>diminished</b> or gyrated (rotated) {{to produce}} a set of 12 polyhedra {{isomorphic}} to the Johnson solids J72 to J83.

5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of <b>diminishing</b> U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the <b>diminishing</b> number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning to the Senate in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly <b>diminishing</b> Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the greed}} of toll road {{operators}} resulted in <b>diminishing</b> upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume {{ownership of the}} roads. It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 ($ when adjusted for inflation from 1916).|$|E
50|$|His {{fundamental}} {{scale is}} the major 6th <b>diminished</b> scale, but equally important are the minor sixth to <b>diminished,</b> the dominant seventh to <b>diminished,</b> and the dominant seven flat five to <b>diminished</b> scale. Extending this concept, Barry relates all chord alterations (flat and sharp 9’s, sharp 11’s, flat 13’s, etc.) to the tritone's minor sixth-diminished scale (Ab minor 6th <b>diminished</b> scale for G7altered), which provides options for moving the alterations through the scales.|$|R

5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by <b>diminishing</b> food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery, competence, and uprightness. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might {{be trying to}} undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus <b>diminishing</b> his ideal stature.|$|E

25|$|Semitone cadences {{are common}} in jazz if not cliché. For example, the {{ascending}} <b>diminished</b> seventh chord semitone cadence, which—using a secondary <b>diminished</b> seventh chord—creates momentum between two chords a major second apart (with the <b>diminished</b> seventh in between). The descending <b>diminished</b> seventh chord semi-tone cadence is assisted by two common tones (Db Fb Abb Cbb=C# E G A#).|$|R
50|$|Unequal fifths, motion between {{perfect and}} <b>diminished</b> fifths is often avoided, with some {{avoiding}} only motion one way (<b>diminished</b> to perfect fifth or perfect to <b>diminished</b> fifth) or {{only if the}} bass is involved. Notice that unequal fifths resemble similar rather than parallel motion, since the perfect fifth is seven semitones and the <b>diminished</b> fifth is six semitones.|$|R
5|$|On October 30, 2017, Sánchez {{revealed}} on the <b>Diminishing</b> Returns podcast {{that he and}} {{the rest}} of the film's creative team are developing a Blair Witch television series, though he pointed out that any decisions would ultimately be up to Lionsgate now that they own the rights to it.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts.

5|$|The {{production}} function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This {{means that the}} longer Robinson works, the more coconuts {{he will be able}} to gather.

5000|$|The main chord qualities are: major, minor, augmented, <b>diminished,</b> half-diminished, and dominant.The symbols {{used for}} chord quality {{are similar to}} those used for {{interval}} quality (see above).

5|$|The success {{prompted}} the ACLU to broaden their {{freedom of speech}} efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature. The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort. By the early 1930s, censorship in the United States was <b>diminishing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon his release, Whale hired one of {{the male}} nurses from the {{hospital}} to be his personal live-in nurse.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by <b>diminishing</b> the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin {{turned his attention to}} Tuscany, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's <b>diminishing</b> control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is <b>diminishing</b> with the advent of {{technology}} and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's <b>diminishing</b> support of the Puerto Rico independence cause.

At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>diminished</b> triad {{in a minor}} scale occurs on the second scale degree; in the key of C minor, this is the D <b>diminished</b> triad (D, F, A). This triad is {{consequently}} called the supertonic <b>diminished</b> triad. Like the supertonic triad found in a major key, the supertonic <b>diminished</b> triad has a predominant function, almost always resolving to a dominant functioning chord.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also stated}} that the intent to <b>diminish</b> will not be lightly {{inferred}} by a federal court.

5000|$|Both the half-whole <b>diminished</b> and its partner mode, the whole-half <b>diminished</b> (with a tone {{rather than}} a semitone {{beginning}} the pattern) are commonly used in jazz improvisation, frequently under different names.
