500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> one being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

[...] In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words Crocodylus pontifex.

2500|$|Templer became GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, {{which had}} come {{under his command}} while he was GOC II Corps, on 31 July 1943. The division, with the 2nd, 3rd Infantry Brigades and the 24th Guards Brigade and {{supporting}} units, was based south of Tunis and had recently fought, with great distinction, in the final phases of the Tunisian Campaign, where it had gained three Victoria Crosses (VC) {{in the space of}} a week. The division was then training for future participation in the Italian Campaign. In late August General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied 15th Army Group, along with numerous and senior US and British generals, arrived to present the VC to Lance Corporal John Kenneally of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards. Shortly afterwards, the division was involved in a divisional parade, with General Dwight [...] "Ike" [...] Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, reviewing the entire division. Templer himself wrote about the moment, saying [...] "I think it was the proudest moment of my life. In his address Ike said, 'When it gives me, your Supreme Commander and an American general, as proud to see you, the 1st Division of the British Army, on parade today as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> 1st Division of the American Army, then we are really getting somewhere!' It was a magnificent parade, and as far as I know, unique". Despite managing to concentrate the division and get it training in mountain warfare, Templer was not destined to lead the 1st Division into battle, although he was later to meet it again in Italy.|$|E
