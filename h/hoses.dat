5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo <b>hoses</b> or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo <b>hoses.</b> A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible <b>hoses.</b> Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched <b>hoses</b> up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While <b>hoses</b> were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just <b>hoses.</b> By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder valves must {{be closed}} whilst in transit and checked {{that there are}} no leaks. Where applicable, {{protective}} valve caps and covers should be fitted to cylinders before transporting. Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to the valve outlet (regulators, <b>hoses</b> etc.).|$|E

5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their <b>hoses</b> to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran <b>hoses</b> four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid <b>hoses.</b> At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's fire {{department}} refused orders from Connor {{to turn the}} <b>hoses</b> on demonstrators again, and waded through {{the basement of the}} Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to clean up water from earlier fire-hose flooding. White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution but said they had no control over politics. Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than <b>hoses).</b>|$|E
40|$|The process serves for shaping a bent {{vulcanized}} <b>hose.</b> First {{a straight}} <b>hose</b> is manufactured from raw rubber, following which the straight <b>hose</b> {{is mounted on}} a bent shaping mandril. The shaping mandril and the mounted <b>hose</b> are then placed in an autoclave for vulcanization. Finally, the vulcanized <b>hose</b> {{is removed from the}} shaping mandril. A gliding auxiliary <b>hose,</b> which has a low coefficient of friction when sliding on the material of the shaping mandril, is placed between the shaping mandril and the <b>hose.</b> The auxiliary <b>hose</b> also has a low coefficient of expansion in relation to the <b>hose...</b>|$|R

5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The <b>hoses</b> were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which <b>hoses</b> were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} fire-fighting {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery <b>hoses.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by <b>hoses</b> to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
50|$|The other {{goal of a}} <b>hose</b> clamp is {{to provide}} {{mechanical}} attachment keeping the <b>hose</b> attached to a barb, <b>hose</b> nipple, or tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the <b>hose</b> behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area {{near the end of}} and completely around the circumference of the <b>hose</b> nipple or tube called a bead. If the <b>hose</b> were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the <b>hose</b> attached to the barb, <b>hose</b> nipple, or beaded tube.|$|R

5|$|Three {{helicopters}} {{had been}} called in {{to assist in the}} rescue, but were prevented by thick smoke generated by the fire. The upper portion of the building was beyond the reach of fire apparatus; the blaze was brought under control only after firefighters set up <b>hoses</b> atop a nearby building. In all, 25 fire stations and over 100 fire appliances were mobilised in response to the incident.|$|E
5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning <b>hoses</b> laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire <b>hoses</b> were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E

5|$|In late October, the Beatles began {{a five-day}} tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg {{engagement}} of December 1962. On {{their return to}} the UK on 31 October several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water <b>hoses</b> to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's <b>hoses.</b> The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire <b>hoses</b> to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an {{organisation}} run {{by several}} insurance {{companies in the}} absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their <b>hoses</b> down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire <b>hoses</b> in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects.

40|$|The present work is {{conducted}} {{within the context}} of air to air refuelling technologies and aims at the development of an understanding of a typical refuelling tanker wake like that of an A 330 [54] and the A 400 M [54]. The wake is particularly investigated within the near field and extended near field wake regions in close vicinity to the rear fuselage. Moreover, the interaction between the wake and the refuelling <b>hose</b> is studied including the resulting <b>hose</b> characteristics. A number of refuelling conditions and aircraft models are considered for the investigation of the wake. Moreover, an arbitrary <b>hose</b> fairing model is considered to study the effect of the fairing on the flow field and the refuelling <b>hose.</b> Different refuelling configurations are taken into account for the investigation of the <b>hose</b> characteristics. Various <b>hose</b> exit positions were studied within the near field wake to assess the impact on the <b>hose</b> characteristics. The probe <b>hose</b> engagement with the associated <b>hose</b> whip phenomenon is a major topic within this work. The <b>hose</b> whip is a highly undesired phenomenon and is amplified by a specific <b>hose</b> shape which is characterised through an inflection point along the <b>hose.</b> The present research reveals that the rear fuselage wake has a crucial impact on the <b>hose</b> characteristics. In particular, the rear fuselage upwash is the primary cause for formation of the undesired <b>hose</b> inflection point. The findings obtained from the present research are used for the suggestion of palliatives to avoid undesirable <b>hose</b> characteristics. In particular, there is one approach recommended which aims at the avoidance of a hose-upwash interaction. It leads to the suggestion of a circumferentially shifted and radially displaced <b>hose</b> exit and deployment of the refuelling <b>hose...</b>|$|R
