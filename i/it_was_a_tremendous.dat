Between then and the French premiere Poulenc {{introduced}} {{one of his}} most popular late works, the Flute Sonata, which he and Jean-Pierre Rampal performed in June at the Strasbourg Festival. Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of Dialogues des Carmélites at the Opéra. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> success, to the composer's considerable relief. At around this time Poulenc began his last romantic relationship, with Louis Gautier, a former soldier; they remained partners to the end of Poulenc's life.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, Sabina had {{delivered}} the libretto {{for a second}} opera, a light comedy entitled The Bartered Bride, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because {{of the success of}} The Brandenburgers, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation. The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, {{on the eve of the}} Austro-Prussian War, with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> public success.|$|E

25|$|King was in {{the army}} from 1942 until 1946. He was based in Melbourne, so he was also able to attend Saturday {{afternoon}} art classes with George Bell. Bell had recently returned from overseas and had brought back news of European Modernism and enthusiasm for artists such as Modigliani, Derain, Braque, Matisse and Picasso. King later said that Bell “opened our eyes to modern art and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> experience”. King’s painting at this time shows the influence of George Bell's style of early modernism. While he {{was in the}} army, King met the artist John Brack, who remained a friend until the latter’s death in 1999. In 1945, King joined the Victorian Artists Society and soon became its secretary and exhibitions manager.|$|E
25|$|Entire {{society was}} then in turmoil and Ramtanu Lahiri {{was going through}} all that. However, certain events in his {{personal}} life affected him seriously. First was the death of two of his brothers, one younger and the other elder. His elder brother had by then risen {{to the position of}} a sheristadar, a remarkable achievement in those days. The death of his elder brother brought on the entire responsibility of the family on to his shoulders. Second, two of his wives had died and he married a third time. Third, the death of David Hare in 1842. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> shock for Ramtanu Lahiri. He revered him as his own father. Throughout his life, he never failed to gather his friends and pay respect to him at his grave on his death anniversary every year.|$|E
25|$|When Mark Lawrenson and Jim Beglin named McManaman {{in their}} {{team of the}} 1990s, they said that most {{managers}} in the league used the same tactic of marking McManaman to stop Liverpool and whilst <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> compliment to McManaman, the opposition could stop Liverpool because the tactical system of 3–5–2 or 3–4–1–2 was too dependent on McManaman and would fail if McManaman was off form, or if the team was not complemented by a quality defence (players who could play both wingback and centre half to cope with onslaughts), or {{the presence of a}} steely defensive midfielder, which was what happened with the team of that time. Nevertheless, McManaman was voted in on the official Liverpool FC website as the club's midfielder of the 1990s, was named by Ruud Gullit as one of his top two players from the entire Premier League era, and despite Liverpool fans' disappointment over the nature of how McManaman conducted his departure, it is believed that many fans still regard McManaman (along with Fowler) as the two players who carried Liverpool through the 1990s.|$|E

In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.'

500|$|Brideshead Revisited was {{published}} in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, [...] "my first novel rather than my last". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was {{the fate of the}} large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of Stalin's Soviet Union by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as [...] "a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts". Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the 1945 general election, he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new [...] "Dark Age".|$|E

500|$|In 1954 Alan Ross, a University of Birmingham {{professor}} of linguistics, devised the terms [...] "U" [...] and [...] "Non-U" [...] to differentiate the speech {{patterns of the}} social classes in England. [...] "U" [...] indicated upper-class usage, and [...] "Non-U" [...] the conventions of the lower strata of society. His article, in a learned Finnish journal and with an illustrative glossary, used [...] The Pursuit of Love [...] to exemplify upper-class speech patterns. In a spirit of mischief, Mitford incorporated the U and Non-U thesis into an article she was writing for Encounter on the English aristocracy. Although this aspect formed only a small section of Mitford's article, when {{it was published in}} September 1955 it caused a major stir. [...] Few recognised the tongue-in-cheek aspect; Mitford received hundreds of letters from [...] worried readers desperate to know if they were snobs or merely [...] "common". The level of anxious or amused interest was sustained {{to such an extent that}} in 1956 Hamish Hamilton reproduced the article in a short book, entitled Noblesse Oblige. The book also included an abbreviated version of [...] Ross's original article, and [...] contributions from Waugh, Betjeman, Peter Fleming and [...] Christopher Sykes, <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> success; as Lovell records, [...] "'U and Non-U' was the buzz phrase of the day... Nancy's comments made her the arbiter of good manners for several generations". Thompson notes the irony that the U and Non-U labels, perhaps Mitford's best-known legacy, were not her own but were borrowed for the purpose of a [...] "tease".|$|E
500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special and I was a little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special night. When I moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough.

[...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E

2500|$|The debacle at Tangier and the captivity {{and death}} of Prince Ferdinand have loomed large in popular Portuguese memory, albeit inconsistently. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> blow to the {{reputation}} of Prince Henry the Navigator. [...] However, Henry managed to deflect attention from his role by encouraging the popular saintly cult of Ferdinand as a national martyr, a 'Saint Prince' or 'Holy Prince' (Infante Santo, although he was never actually beatified by the Catholic Church) who 'voluntarily' submitted to scourge and death for Portugal's imperial mission, rather than a victim of Henry's military pretensions and blunders. [...] Henry commissioned Frei João Álvares to compose the chronicle of Ferdinand's imprisonment {{as a piece of}} Christian hagiography (although Álvares does not quite endorse the Henrican interpretation of events). Nonetheless, Henry's interpretation gained currency in later years, particularly as Henry's own reputation ascended retrospectively with the glorification of the Age of Discovery, and the blemish of Tangier needed to be scrubbed away.|$|E
