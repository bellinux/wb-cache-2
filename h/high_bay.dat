25|$|Inside the VAB {{transfer}} aisle, lifting {{operations to}} rotate Atlantis vertically commenced on 18 May 2011. The crane that hoisted the shuttle placed {{it into the}} adjacent <b>high</b> <b>bay.</b> Atlantis was next lowered {{to meet up with}} the external tank and the two solid rocket boosters. The mating operations were completed on 19 May 2011. On the same day, NASA officially announced 8 July 2011 as the intended launch date of the STS-135 mission.|$|E
25|$|On {{the early}} morning of 17 May 2011, Space Shuttle Atlantis {{departed}} OPF-1 {{and headed to the}} VAB for mating operations with ET-138. The short trip took longer than normal and allowed the shuttle workers to pose for a photo opportunity with the shuttle. The four STS-135 astronauts were also present to greet the workers and representatives of the media. Atlantis remained on the Orbiter Transport System overnight, as opposed to heading over to <b>High</b> <b>Bay</b> 1 on the same day.|$|E

25|$|The two SRBs were {{designated}} as flight set 122 by contractor Alliant Techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions {{dating back to}} STS-1. Inside the VAB, engineers attached a large sling to Discovery and the orbiter was rotated vertical. The orbiter was lifted into the <b>high</b> <b>bay</b> where its external tank (ET-137) and boosters were waiting to be mated. During the mating operations, an internal nut pre-positioned inside the aft compartment of the orbiter slipped out of position and fell away inside the compartment. Engineers initially were worried that the orbiter {{would have to be}} removed from the ET and placed back in a horizontal orientation to make repairs. However, later they successfully accessed the area inside the aft compartment, and re-positioned the nut to complete the repairs. The bolting of the orbiter to its ET ('hard mate') was completed early in the morning of 11 September 2010 at 09:27 EDT.|$|E

The area was then settled by New England Planters. Settlement was expedited by the United Empire Loyalists during the American Revolution.|$|E

Technicians inside the VAB, lifted the left-aft segment from the handling crate and carefully maneuvered into <b>High</b> <b>Bay</b> No. 1 and finally onto the mobile launch platform. The booster stacking was completed in mid April. The completed boosters had a mixture of refurbished and unflown elements (11 sections on each booster). For example, the forward dome for the right-hand booster is new, while the upper cylinder on the left booster flew with STS-1 – the historic maiden flight of Space Shuttle Columbia.
