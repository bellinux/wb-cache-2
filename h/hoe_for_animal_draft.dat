25|$|Although {{occasionally}} {{mentioned as}} {{a copy of the}} French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydropneumatic recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> <b>draft,</b> and another with solid rubber tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The Type 90 75mm field gun {{was unique}} among Japanese {{artillery}} pieces {{in that it}} had a muzzle brake. The carriage was of the split trail type.

25|$|Suffimentum is {{a general}} word for a {{preparation}} used for healing, purification, or warding off ill influence. In his treatise on veterinary medicine, Vegetius recommends a suffimentum as an effective cure <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and <b>for</b> humans prone to emotional outbursts, {{as well as for}} driving off hailstorms, demons and ghosts (daemones and umbras).|$|R
2500|$|In the 19th century, {{the central}} meadow {{of what is}} now Corbett State Park was a popular {{stopping}} place on the pioneer wagon road that crossed the Cascade Range near Santiam Pass. [...] Pioneer travelers liked the site because it offered fresh water and good grazing <b>for</b> their <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> [...] In the early 20th century, the meadow was also used by sheepherders who grazed their flocks in the eastern foothills of the Cascades.|$|R
2500|$|Farm {{machinery}} and higher crop yields reduced the labor to produce 100 bushels of corn from 35 to 40 hours in 1900 to 2 hours 45 minutes in 1999. The conversion of agricultural mechanization to internal combustion power began after 1915. [...] The horse population {{began to decline}} in the 1920s after the conversion of agriculture and transportation to internal combustion. [...] In addition to saving labor, this freed up much land previously used <b>for</b> supporting <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{of the history of}} wheel, chart and <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> in prehistoric times is primarily based on direct finds like wheels, parts of charts or jokes. Other possibilities are osteological evidences <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> But it is also very important to try to reconstruct the history of the landscape and the settlement patterns. This is the prerequisite for understanding since when the bringing into action of <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> wheels and charts made sense. The archaeobiological investigations from the Neolithic lake shore settlements at the Lake Zürich (town of Zürich) gave sensible indications that this was the case at the transition from the early to the late Late Neolithic period (Jung- / Spätneolithikum), from the Pfyn to the Horgen culture. From the Horgen culture onwards, there is an augmentation of settlements and there are also signs for a sensible opening of the landscape. In addition, we can suppose a diversification of the economy. Therefore, from the Horgen culture onwards a use of <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and charts makes sense...|$|R

50|$|The British troops {{wanted to}} have fresh {{provisions}} to consume, and also required fresh forage <b>for</b> their <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and horses. General George Washington ordered the systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to the British, and companies of American militia and troops harassed British and German forays to acquire such provisions. While many of these operations were small, {{in some cases they}} became quite elaborate, involving more than 1,000 troops. The American operations were so successful that British casualties in New Jersey (including those of the battles at Trenton and Princeton) exceeded those of the entire campaign for New York.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{referenced}} that Majipoor {{receives the}} occasional starship, but {{is generally considered}} a backwater planet. Metals of all sorts are scarce, since the planet has a very light crust. Technology is both pervasive and rare at the same time. <b>For</b> example, <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> are used <b>for</b> farming and transport, but the animals used (called [...] "mounts") were genetically created in the distant past. Many great engineering works are referenced, but these were created in the past also. Many modern technologies, such as TV and radio, seem to be nonexistent or of very limited use. The average Majipooran lives a peasant lifestyle, and agriculture is a common occupation.|$|R
30|$|However, {{many cities}} are not well-suited to year-round bike transport. For those cities, walking {{or use of}} carts, and use of animals such as horses and donkeys will {{probably}} begin to replace vehicle transport in some areas. Animals such as horses and oxen will also increasingly be used for harvesting and transporting food, as in the hinterlands of most cities {{before the advent of}} fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Some small farms in the USA and elsewhere are already increasingly using <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> rather than tractors because of the costs of fuel [81] and there are ethno-religious populations such as the Amish in some rural areas in the USA which still rely primarily on horses and oxen. This of course raises the issue of the land needed to produce fodder <b>for</b> these <b>animals.</b> <b>For</b> the USA prior to the widespread use of tractors and harvesters, {{it has been estimated that}} in 1915, about 93 million acres of farmland in the USA was devoted to producing feed (mainly oats) for horses and mules [2]. Little of this land would be available now to produce feed <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
40|$|More than 85 % of {{communal}} area farmers in Zimbabwe use <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power <b>for</b> tillage and transport. Oxen {{provide more than}} 75 % of this power, but cows and donkeys seem to be gaining prominence. Research and development efforts on <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power technology are negligible when compared with work on beef and dairy cattle. A lot of work has also been done on implements, but without much consideration of the <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> used on smallholder farms. The country has experienced two severe droughts since 1990, but the extent of damage caused to the <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> population is not known. Other challenges facing <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power development in Zimbabwe include the non-existence of appropriate on-farm feeding strategies, poor health management (particularly for donkeys), assessing the impact of training programmes for rural artisans, and development of affordable harnesses for donkeys. Appropriate farmer participatory approaches (including gender analysis) {{should be used in}} all efforts aiming to meet these challenges. For there to be sustainable development of <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power in Zimbabwe, educational curricula should be revised and tailored to promote animal power instead of tractor power. Finally, <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power workers should share information, engage in collaborative activities, and avoid duplication of efforts. Meagre resources would then be used more efficiently to develop <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} three ex-ante studies, from Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia, that examined the potential for adoption of agroforestry technologies should they be extended to farmers. Ethnographic linear programme modelling of households in all three locations shows that the potential adoption of these technologies depends on household composition, farm size, and availability of draft power. Results show that {{both male and female}} headed households can adopt the technology. A seed selling incentive enhanced adoption through augmenting household income and benefited farmers by increasing funds available for discretionary use. In Zimbabwe there was a greater increase in discretionary cash <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> owners than non-owners. It is concluded that in Southern Africa, improved fallows are a viable alternative to chemical fertilizer use for small farmers...|$|R
5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians. He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area <b>for</b> horses, <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1978, {{as part of}} the Four Modernizations campaign, the Family Production Responsibility System was created, {{dismantling}} communes {{and giving}} agricultural production responsibility back to individual households. Households are now given crop quotas that they were required to provide to their collective unit in return <b>for</b> tools, <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> seeds, and other essentials. Households, which now lease land from their collectives, are free to use their farmland however they see fit as long as they meet these quotas. This freedom has given more power to individual families to meet their individual needs. In addition to these structural changes, the Chinese government also engages in irrigation projects (such as the Three Gorges Dam), runs large state farms, and encourages mechanization and fertilizer use.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} discuss the first steps in {{a case study of}} present-day use, {{processing}} and storage of cereals and pulses, as well as several other plants used <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> in NW Tunisia. Data has been recorded using images and video filming, interviews and plant collection. Cereals, pulses, and other fodder plants are part of domestic production that was processed with the animal-drawn threshing sledge. This case study was primarily undertaken to better understand how present-day human food and fodder use is related to this particular technology, and to examine the variability in plants and processing techniques today. We found that non-mechanised threshing, but also harvesting of wild and domestic kinds of green fodder, are still geared to producing specific products <b>for</b> feeding <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and cows kept by farmers, who attribute particular importance to the superior qualities of various plants as fodder, for taste and quality of milk. In addition to use as human foods, specific products of cereals are used for temper for plaster and mud-brick...|$|R
25|$|The {{second group}} {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey <b>animals</b> sought <b>for</b> food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans {{did not intend to}} domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.|$|R

5000|$|Advertising for {{motorised}} {{equipment in}} farm journals during this era did {{its best to}} compete against horse-drawn methods with economic arguments, extolling common themes such as that a tractor [...] "eats only when it works", that one tractor could replace many horses, and that mechanisation could allow one man to get more work done per day than he ever had before. The horse population in the US began to decline in the 1920s after the conversion of agriculture and transportation to internal combustion. Peak tractor sales in the US were around 1950.

The dog {{was the first to}} be domesticated, and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.|$|R
