40|$|Two simple Bartonella bacilliformis <b>immunoblot</b> {{preparation}} methods were developed. Antigen was prepared by two different methods: sonication of whole organisms or glycine extraction. Both methods were then tested for sensitivity and specificity. Well-defined control sera were utilized {{in the development}} of these diagnostic <b>immunoblots,</b> and possible cross-reactions were thoroughly examined. Sera investigated for cross-reaction with these diagnostic antigens were drawn from patients with brucellosis, chlamydiosis, Q fever, and cat scratch disease, all of whom were from regions where bartonellosis is not endemic. While both <b>immunoblots</b> yielded reasonable sensitivity and high specificity, we recommend the use of the sonicated <b>immunoblot,</b> which has a higher sensitivity when used to detect acute disease and produces fewer cross-reactions.

Six sequential serum samples {{were obtained from}} patients before, during, and until one year after antibiotic therapy and analyzed by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and <b>immunoblot</b> assays. An <b>immunoblot</b> procedure utilizing a gradient gel and an image analysis system was developed. A relational database management system was {{used to analyze the}} results and provide criteria for early disease <b>immunoblot</b> interpretation. Recommended criteria for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) <b>immunoblot</b> are the recognition of two of three proteins (24, 39, and 41 kDa). The recommended criteria for a positive IgG <b>immunoblot</b> are the recognition of two of five proteins (20, 24 [> 19 intensity units], 35, 39, and 88 kDa). Alternatively, if band intensity cannot be measured, the 22 -kDa protein can be substituted for the 24 -kDa protein with only a small decrease in sensitivity. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify all these proteins except the 35 -kDa protein. With the proposed <b>immunoblot</b> interpretations, the sequential serum samples were examined. At visit 1, the day of diagnosis and initiation of treatment, 54. 5 % of the serum samples were either IgM or IgG positive. The peak antibody response, with 80 % of the serum samples positive, occurred at visit 2, 8 to 12 days into treatment. The sensitivities of the IgM and IgG <b>immunoblot</b> for detecting patients that were seropositive into the study period were 58. 5 and 54. 6 %, respectively, at visit 1 and 100 % at visit 2.

40|$|In October 1994, the Second National Conference on the Serologic Diagnosis of Lyme Disease {{recommended}} a two-step approach to serological testing. The {{first step was}} the performance of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the second step was a confirmatory <b>immunoblot.</b> New criteria for the interpretation of a positive <b>immunoblot</b> were also recommended. The committee decided to omit the 31 - and 34 -kDa bands (OspA and OspB, respectively) from the choice of bands considered diagnostic for a positive <b>immunoblot.</b> Since we had previously included these in our diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease-positive <b>immunoblots,</b> we reviewed data for all patients attending a Lyme disease center with positive ELISAs and <b>immunoblot</b> assays for Lyme disease from 1 September 1992 to 31 December 1993. The criteria for a positive Western blot (<b>immunoblot)</b> were the presence of 5 or 12 bands, including the 10 recommended by the conference, {{and the presence of}} the 31 - and 34 -kDa protein bands. Of the 136 patients evaluated, 50 were considered to have Lyme disease. Of these 50, 4 (8 %) would not have met <b>immunoblot</b> criteria for the diagnosis if the new recommendations were used. Had the 31 - and 34 -kDa bands been included as part of the diagnostic requirements for <b>immunoblot,</b> these patients would have been included. Although overdiagnosis of Lyme disease appears to be the more frequent problem, our concern is that the exclusion of the 31 - and 34 -kDa protein bands from the diagnostic criteria may result in the underdiagnosis of Lyme disease by those who would rely too heavily on serological confirmation. The addition of the 31 - and 34 -kDa bands to those recommended for confirmatory <b>immunoblot</b> should be reconsidered...|$|R

We compared the reactivity of sera to a B. microti <b>immunoblot</b> assay in 24 human subjects experiencing symptoms and expressing laboratory evidence of babesiosis, 28 subjects who experienced Lyme disease, 12 subjects who experienced human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and 51 subjects who reported no history of any of these diseases and whose sera did not react against B. microti antigen in an IFA test. <b>Immunoblot</b> strips were impregnated with proteins derived from the GI strain of B. microti that had been electrophoresed in an acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The sera of all subjects who experienced babesiosis reacted against the B. microti antigen in the IFA and against at least one of nine <b>immunoblot</b> protein bands specific to B. microti. In contrast, none of the sera from people who appeared not to have experienced this infection reacted against the B. microti antigen in the IFA (compared to 4 % in the <b>immunoblot</b> assay).
