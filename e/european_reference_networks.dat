40|$|The {{determination}} of the blast protection level of civil engineering buildings components against explosive effects represents a design topic of crucial importance, in current practice. However, some key aspects of blast resistant structures design have been only marginally considered in the last decade, and currently still require appropriate regulations.

40|$|Abstract: Native {{information}} provider (IP) anycast suffers from routing scalability {{issues and the}} lack of stateful communication support. For this reason, we propose architecture for scalable and transparent anycast services (ASTAS), a proxy-based architecture that provides support for stateful anycast communications, while retaining the transparency offered by native anycast. Dynamic resource assignment for each initiated session guarantees that a connection is established with the most suitable target server, based on network and server conditions. Traffic engineering in the overlay can be realized in an effective way due to the dissemination of aggregated state information in the anycast overlay. To minimize the total deployment cost for ASTAS architectures, we propose optimized proxy placement and path finding heuristics based on look-ahead information gathered in network nodes. Contrary to a regular integer linear program (ILP) formulation, these heuristics allow to optimize proxy placement in large networks. A use case on a <b>European</b> <b>reference</b> <b>network</b> illustrates that lower proxy costs enable proxy deployment closer to the end-users, resulting in a reduced network load.

40|$|Background: Rare diseases, {{including}} those of genetic origin, are defined by the European Union as lifethreatening or chronically debilitating diseases which are of such low prevalence (less than 5 per 10 000). The specificities of rare diseases - limited number of patients and scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise - single them out as a unique domain of very high European added-value. Methods: The legal instruments {{at the disposal of}} the European Union, in terms of the Article 152 of the Treaties, are very limited. However a combination of instruments using the research and the pharmaceutical legal basis and an intensive and creative use of funding from the Second Health Programme has permitted to create a solid basis that Member States have considered enough to put rare diseases in a privileged position in the health agenda. Results: The adoption of the Commission Communication, in November 2008, and of the Council Recommendation, in June 2009, and the future adoption of the Directive on Cross-border healthcare, end 2009 or mid 2010, have created an operational framework to act in the field of rare disease with European coordination in several areas (classification and codification, <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Networks,</b> orphan drugs, European Committee of Experts, etc.).

This article instead, wanting to deepen this perspective, postulates that the ERNs may also be related to widespread diseases, such as those of coloproctological interest, with the aim of setting up a European Network of Coloproctology (ENCP). Here are analyzed: (a) the documents related to ERNs and others related to research and training, the characteristics of the coloproctological diseases, and proposal of the ENCP; (b) a survey that involves 14 out of 25 of the National and Regional Representative of the European Society of Coloproctology.

40|$|Objective: Intellectual {{disability}} (ID) with {{or without}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD), {{is one of the}} main reasons for referral to a clinical geneticist. ID has a major impact on affected individuals, their families and society. The recent advances in genetic technologies have enabled to identify disease causing variants throughout the whole human exome, even at the single base-pair level of the DNA. This significant increase in diagnostic potential is of high value for proper genetic counseling and paves the way for studying fundamental aspects of brain functioning on one hand and the more personalized approach of syndrome specific management of ID disorders at the clinical site on the other hand. Participants and Methods: So far, over 2000 ID patients have been investigated in our genome diagnostic center by whole exome sequencing which revealed a diagnostic yield of around 30 %. Though most genes are very rarely affected, by collaborative efforts with other (inter) national genetic departments, substantial cohorts enable the definition of numerous such novel rare genetic syndromes. Results: Examples of novel syndromes that we have recently defined are GATAD 2 B, POGZ, KBG, USP 9 X and DDX 3 X. The increase in novel syndromes needs multidisciplinary expertise and care including neuropsychiatric involvement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with organic}} acidurias (OAD) and urea cycle {{disorders}} (UCD) are {{at increased risk}} of disability, impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy. Clinical care in any one centre is constrained by small patient numbers; and furthermore diagnostic and treatment strategies vary between metabolic centres and countries, resulting in significant inequalities and disparity in patient outcome. AIMS/METHODS: The overall objective of the EU-funded activity 'European registry and network for intoxication type metabolic diseases' (E-IMD) is to collect systematic data to improve the knowledge of these diseases, to develop consensus care guidelines and to provide detailed information materials for families and professionals. RESULTS: Within three years E-IMD has (1) established a network of 87 partners in 25 countries (2) set up a patient registry of more than 1, 000 individuals with OAD and UCD, (3) launched a website (www. e-imd. org) including detailed information materials in 11 languages, (4) developed guidelines for OAD and UCD, (5) organised two teaching courses and various scientific meetings, (6) extended the IT platform clustering with other inherited metabolic diseases (IMD) and (7) strengthened the collaboration with other international scientific consortia. CONCLUSIONS: E-IMD has made important steps towards improving and sharing knowledge on OAD and UCD and harmonisation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Through the establishment of a modular patient registry, clustering with other IMD and stepwise extension of the network, E-IMD has implemented the core components of a <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Network</b> for rare diseases...|$|R

40|$|A {{call from}} the EU for the set-up of <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Networks</b> (ERNs) is {{expected}} to be launched {{in the first quarter of}} 2016. ERNs are intended to improve the care for patients with low prevalent or rare diseases throughout the EU by, among other things, facilitating the pooling and exchange of experience and knowledge and the development of protocols and guidelines. In the past, for example where costly orphan drugs have been concerned, industry has played an important role in facilitating consensus meetings and publication of guidelines. The ERNs should provide a unique opportunity for healthcare professionals and patients to lead these activities in an independent way. However, currently costs for networking activities are not to be covered by EU funds and alternative sources of funding are being explored. There is growing concern that any involvement of the industry in the funding of ERNs and their core activities may create a risk of undue influence. To date, the European Commission has not been explicit in how industry will be engaged in ERNs. We believe that public funding and a conflict of interest policy are needed at the level of the ERNs, Centers of Expertise (CEs), healthcare professionals and patient organizations with the aim of maintaining scientific integrity and independence. Specific attention is needed where it concerns the development of clinical practice guidelines. A proposal for a conflict of interest policy is presented, which may support the development of a framework to facilitate collaboration, safeguard professional integrity and to establish and maintain public acceptability and trust among patients, their organizations and the general publi...|$|E
40|$|The Community {{added value}} of Centres of Expertise (CoE) and <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Networks</b> (ERN) is {{particularly}} high for rare diseases (RD) {{due to the}} rarity of these conditions, which implies both {{a small number of}} patients and scarcity of expertise within a single country. Gathering expertise at the European level is therefore, paramount in order to ensure equal access to accurate information, appropriate and timely diagnosis and high quality clinical care and follow up for patients with rare diseases. This applies particularly to rare anaemias due to the high number of different rare diseases that constitute this group. In this context, the European Network for Rare and Congenital Anaemias (ENERCA), co-financed by the European Commission, was created in 2002 with the aim of prevention and management of rare anaemias (RA) and the development and promotion of policies to improve the well-being of European Union citizens. The ENERCA White Book is a position paper, developed as a deliverable of the ENERCA (phase 3) project that intends to contribute {{to the creation of a}} ERN in RA (ERN-RA) by preparation of the recommendations and, in particular, the definition of the criteria that CoE, local centres (LC) and their interrelations have to fulfil as healthcare providers. It has been nourished by all the activities that have been performed over the past ten years within the ENERCA framework. The White Book is addressed to authorities in charge of the identifying CoE, as an essential requirement for the official recognition of the ERN, to European and national health authorities, Healthcare centres and health professionals, as well as to all other stakeholders interested in RA. It is also addressed to the patients, as a way to empower their community in this process. One particular characteristic of the White Book is the integration of the three main aspects of a CoE: a) ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the non-discrimination and non-stigmatisation of rare disease patients across Europe, within their sphere of competencies; b) clinical and laboratory frameworks for defining technical and quality criteria including scope, general and disease specific elements currently defined as technical and professional standards for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with RA; and c) the expectations patients have of CoE. Conceived as a working tool directed to a broad range of stakeholders, the White book has been designed and structured to be comprehensible even to non-technical and /or non-professional audiences. The reader will find an up-to-date description and epidemiological information on RA as well as the European Union background policies for defining CoE and ERN-RA. A working group was created with experts of different profiles, known as the European Working Group on Rare Anaemias (EGRA). In order to achieve its objectives, the methodology used by EGRA, was characterised by three main principles: Interdisciplinary, European coverage, and evidence-based principles. Work has been developed into four sequential steps: 1. Analysis of the current situation of RA in Europe by healthcare professionals in order to identify the most relevant issues that have to be addressed by a centre in order for it to be recommended as CoE. 2. Preparation of questionnaires to perform surveys on how the relevant issues identified in step 1 can be translated into practical recommendations. 3. Analysis of the questionnaire results by face to face meetings, feedback and consensus evaluation, and 4. Preparation of a report on ENERCA policy recommendations for CoE. This report is presented in a user-friendly format, easy to understand and available through the ENERCA website (www. enerca. org). Several important conclusions can be drawn from the ENERCA White Book, including the importance of laboratories involved in the diagnosis of RA, patient oriented and multidisciplinary care at the CoE, the need for coordination and cooperation within and outside the centre, the provision of information to patients and health professionals and the involvement of public authorities at the national and European levels. Official recognition of this structure and assurance of its long term sustainability will only be achieved if public authorities work hand by hand with both professionals experts in different disciplines and patients. Finally, the ENERCA White book aims to be a practical tool for health authorities of Member States (MS) that are preparing their national directory of formally designated CoE. For this, it is important that MS authorities recognise RA as an important health component to be included within the National Plans or Actions for Rare Diseases...|$|E

40|$|Security, as a goal, {{is already}} {{expressed}} in the EU Internal Security Strategy in Action: ‘every physical asset, public or private building infrastructures are potential targets for terrorist threats and can also be damaged by accidents’. Their protection starts from the resistance and robustness of the physical structure itself, so that if security measures fail, catastrophic consequences can be contained. EU policies concerning the security of infrastructures set out to strengthen the efforts towards their standardisation and harmonisation, which is not surprising because the construction sector is crucial for the European economy. Indeed constructions are key {{for the quality of}} life of citizens, as they spend a considerable amount of time in buildings. Moreover, in the presence of natural and man-made hazards, the welfare of citizens’ depends on the performance of the infrastructures that surround them. Consequently the availability of Eurocodes and European standards in buildings infrastructures constitutes a starting point for both risk reduction and harmonisation. Further, although building infrastructures cannot be defined as ECI they are a key element across all sectors and subsectors including that of energy and transport identified in the European Council Directive 2008 / 114 /EC. Besides, potential incidents stemming from threats and acts of terrorism are usually considered as a priority for CIP and a all-hazards approach should be favoured. In support of EU efforts to protect critical infrastructures and reduce their vulnerability, the European Commission has launched the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and funded the <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Network</b> for Critical Infrastructure Protection (ERNCIP). Both have the scope to provide a framework within which experimental facilities and laboratories share knowledge and expertise for harmonising test protocols throughout Europe.

Hence the report builds the basis for an actual evaluation of the different numerical methods, their suitability to certain problems, and their capability to support/complement the experimental testing of glass components.

40|$|Abstract. More {{than ten}} years ago, the {{advantages}} of the GPS technology were recognized and a first GPS campaign covering the western part of Europe was organized in order to establish a uniform <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> Frame (EUREF). Through successive GPS campaigns, the network has been extended towards eastern parts of Europe and various countries have undertaken densification campaigns. The international co-operation within Europe has resulted in the establishment of a high accuracy, three dimensional geodetic network with links to global and national reference systems. Strategies and guidelines have been developed for network densification, observation procedures, data flow and data analysis. This has resulted in today's permanent GPS network comprising in excess of more than 80 stations, a data handling service and supported by 12 analysis centers. The results show an accurate and consistent network(+/- 3 mm in the horizontal component, +/- 6 mm in the height component). Since 1995, emphasis has been placed on the height component, resulting in an extended and improved adjustment of the United European Leveling Network (UELN) and the establishment of the <b>European</b> Vertical GPS <b>Reference</b> <b>Network</b> (EUVN). Today, the EUREF Network contributes towards multi-disciplinary activities such as the estimation of meteorological parameters and links to tide gauges...|$|R

Main reason for initiation of EUVN_DA project are the discrepancyies between the current gravimetric quasigeoid (EGG 97) and the point-wise EUVN quasigeoid. Differences between the EGG 97 quasigeoid and the GPS/levelling quasigeoidal height anomalies of the EUVN stations are significant and highly variable in some part of Europe. In Slovenia is for EUVN_DA project responsible Surveying and Mapping Authority of Republic of Slovenia (SMARS; GURS in Slovenia) in cooperation with Geodetic Institute of Slovenia (GIS) and University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering (FGG). On the territory of Slovenia are 12 EUVN_DA stations (new EUVN stations). There are two points (SI 01 in SI 03), that are already part of the EUVN. Project requires three tipes of measurements: levelling, GPS- observations and gravimetric measurements. This papier describes how are the required data gained from the results of the measurements. Estimated accuracy of geopotential and normal height of EUVN_DA-stations is also provided. Theoretical part of diploma is focused on gravitiy field of the Earth and definitions of the Heights sistems...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{confirmation}} of paediatric tuberculosis (TB) is frequently lacking. We reviewed {{the range of}} routine laboratory tests and their performance in different biological samples used to diagnose active TB in children. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among the <b>European</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratory <b>Network</b> for TB followed by collection of routine laboratory data on 10, 549 paediatric samples tested in 2007 to 2011 at six reference laboratories (in Croatia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and the United Kingdom (UK)). The questionnaire showed that all laboratories used rapid assays. Non-respiratory samples were collected more often in Germany (135 / 275, 49. 1 %) and the UK (490 / 2, 140, 22. 9 %) compared with Croatia (138 / 2, 792, 4. 9 %), Latvia (222 / 2, 401, 9. 2 %) and Lithuania (76 / 1, 549, 4. 9 %). Overall laboratory positivity rates (isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and/or identification of its nucleic acids in a sample) were higher in lymph node and gastric aspirate samples (14 / 203 (6. 9 %) and 43 / 1, 231 (3. 5 %)) than in sputum samples (89 / 4, 684 (1. 9 %)). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of molecular assays assessed against solid or liquid culture were 79. 2 %, 93. 6 %, 67. 1 %, 96. 5 % and 91. 6 %, respectively. A more intensive approach in obtaining gastric aspirate and non-respiratory samples may increase laboratory {{confirmation of}} paediatric TB. Major effort is needed in optimisation and validation of molecular tests in these samples...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reference</b> hydrometric <b>networks,</b> {{consisting}} of near-natural catchments gauged by stations with good hydrometric performance, {{are increasingly being}} used by researchers in order to discern natural, climate-driven trends from other, more direct, anthropogenic disturbances (e. g. water abstraction and reservoir influences). In the UK, a “Benchmark” network has been designated, and has formed {{the core of a}} number of assessments of hydrological change. The Benchmark network has also been integrated into a pan-European <b>network</b> of <b>reference</b> catchments which has recently been used to characterize hydrological trends on a <b>European</b> scale. Whilst <b>reference</b> <b>networks</b> provide a natural flow response, they have a number of limitations. <b>Reference</b> <b>networks</b> are dominated by small (< 1000 km 2) headwater catchments – a necessary response to the need for an undisturbed flow condition – which are sparsely distributed, particularly in Europe, where human impacts on flow regimes are pervasive and issues of data sharing limit coverage. Flow records from reference catchments are typically short (from the 1960 s – present), as catchments with long streamflow records tend to be vulnerable to inhomogeneities (e. g. due to changing gauging practices over time). However, there is a danger that results from short, fixed study periods may not be representative of long-term variability. There is, therefore, a fundamental mismatch between the spatial scale and temporal coverage offered by <b>reference</b> <b>networks,</b> and the scales required by policymakers in formulating responses to climate-driven hydrological change This presentation draws upon a range of recent research to provide a synthesis of key findings from studies of <b>reference</b> <b>networks</b> in the UK and Europe, with a particular focus on how data from networks of distributed catchments can be used to examine large-scale hydrological changes. The presentation illustrates some of the key methodological challenges associated with the analysis of <b>reference</b> <b>networks,</b> and will consider methods for overcoming limited spatial and temporal domain coverage in order to infer long-term hydrological variability at the regional, national, and continental scales. In addressing spatial coverage, approaches for reconciling small-scale observations with larger scales are considered, e. g. using large-scale hydrological models to provide estimates of change in ungauged areas. In addressing temporal coverage, the emphasis will be on methods which dispense with fixed study periods and thereby allow inter-decadal variabilty to be characterized, whilst consideration will be given to reconciling results from reference catchments with longer (albeit less reliable) records which provide proxies of change over timescales of a century or greater. This presentation reinforces the importance of <b>reference</b> <b>networks</b> in facilitating the identification and attribution of climate-driven trends. The inherent limitations of spatial and temporal coverage, a function of the exacting requirements of such networks, requires novel methodologies to provide a wider context; which, in the long-term, should lead to greater reconciliation between observations of change and projections from models, and improved knowledge of the magnitude and pace of regional hydrological change. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>European</b> Centres of <b>Reference</b> <b>Network</b> for Cystic Fibrosis (ECORN-CF) {{established}} an Internet forum which {{provides the opportunity}} for CF patients and other interested people to ask experts questions about CF in their mother language. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: 1) develop a detailed quality assessment tool to analyze quality of expert answers, 2) evaluate the intra- and inter-rater agreement of this tool, and 3) explore changes in the quality of expert answers over the time frame of the project. Methods: The quality assessment tool was developed by an expert panel. Five experts within the ECORN-CF project used the quality assessment tool to analyze the quality of 108 expert answers published on ECORN-CF from six language zones. 25 expert answers were scored at two time points, one year apart. Quality of answers was also assessed at an early and later period of the project. Individual rater scores and group mean scores were analyzed for each expert answer. Results: A scoring system and training manual were developed analyzing two quality categories of answers: content and formal quality. For content quality, the grades based on group mean scores for all raters showed substantial agreement between two time points, however {{this was not the case}} for the grades based on individual rater scores. For formal quality the grades based on group mean scores showed only slight agreement between two time point...|$|R
