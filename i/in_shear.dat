5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204km/h (127mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> and {{the passage of a}} trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{interaction}} between a cold front, multiple tropical waves, {{and a broad}} {{area of low pressure}} in the wake of Nicole {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on October11 about 115mi (185km) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The nascent cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Paula six hours later, briefly moving ashore the northeastern tip of Honduras early on October11 before re-emerging into the northwestern Caribbean. Amid a favorable environment, Paula intensified into a hurricane by 00:00UTC on October12 and attained peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) at 18:00UTC while maintaining an unusually small size. An increase <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> prompted a steady weakening trend as the system turned north and then east. Paula fell to tropical storm intensity early on October14, making landfall between Santa Lucia and Puerto Esperanza with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The system further weakened to a tropical depression early on October15 and degenerated into a remnant low by 12:00UTC. The remnant low quickly became diffuse, dissipating at 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection to wax and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to {{turn back to the}} west-southwest. Moving back beneath an anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, with the small structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of two identical vortices <b>in</b> linear <b>shear</b> was studied both numerically and experimentally. Numerical simulations {{based on the}} technique of contour dynamics reveal that the vortex evolution <b>in</b> adverse <b>shear</b> is significantly different from that <b>in</b> cooperative <b>shear.</b> Vortices <b>in</b> adverse <b>shear</b> predominantly separate, whereas vortices <b>in</b> cooperative <b>shear</b> predominantly merge. <b>In</b> addition, adverse <b>shear</b> may destruct the vortices much {{in the same way}} as a single vortex <b>in</b> adverse <b>shear,</b> whereas cooperative shear stabilizes the vortices and thus enhances the possibility of vortex merger.

25|$|Liquefaction is {{more likely}} to occur in loose to {{moderately}} saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as silty sands or sands and gravels capped or containing seams of impermeable sediments. During wave loading, usually cyclic undrained loading, e.g. seismic loading, loose sands tend to decrease in volume, which produces an increase in their pore water pressures and consequently a decrease <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> strength, i.e. reduction in effective stress.|$|E
25|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability {{is determined by the}} balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events which can then make a slope unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increase <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces.

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental.

Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E

25|$|Vascular remodelling in non-embryonic tissues is {{considered}} to be symptomatic of disease progression. Cardiovascular disease {{remains one of the most}} common causes of death globally and is often associated with the blockage or stenosis of blood vessels, which can have dramatic biomechanical effects. In acute and chronic remodelling, the increase <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> stress due to the decreased diameter of a blocked vessel can cause vasodilation, thereby restoring typical shear stress levels. However, dilation also leads to increased blood flow through the vessel, which can result in hyperaemia, affect physiological regulatory actions downstream of the afflicted vessel, and place increased pressure on atherosclerotic plaques which may lead to rupture. Blockage of blood vessels is currently treated by surgically inserting stents to force vessel diameters open and restore normal blood flow. By understanding the implication of increased shear stress on homeostatic regulators, alternative, less-invasive methods may be developed to treat vessel blockage.|$|E
25|$|Stone, {{brick and}} other such {{materials}} are strong in compression and somewhat so <b>in</b> <b>shear,</b> but cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges {{are designed to be}} constantly under compression, so far as is possible. Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone {{in the middle of the}} bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

30|$|A hybrid finite-discrete element {{method was}} {{implemented}} {{to study the}} fracture process of rough rock joints under direct shearing. The hybrid method reproduced the joint shear resistance evolution process from asperity sliding to degradation and from gouge formation to grinding. It is found that, <b>in</b> the direct <b>shear</b> test of rough rock joints under constant normal displacement loading conditions, higher shearing rate promotes the asperity degradation but constraints the volume dilation, which then results <b>in</b> higher peak <b>shear</b> resistance, more gouge formation and grinding, and smoother new joint surfaces. Moreover, {{it is found that}} the joint roughness affects the joint shear resistance evolution through influencing the joint fracture micro mechanism. The asperity degradation and gouge grinding are the main failure micro-mechanism <b>in</b> <b>shearing</b> rougher rock joints with deeper asperities while the asperity sliding is the main failure micro-mechanism <b>in</b> <b>shearing</b> smoother rock joints with shallower asperities.

500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August 14. A ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward. An area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the Cape Verde islands, and on August 15, meteorologists began classifying the system with the Dvorak technique. The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated, and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Three developed late on August 16, about [...] east-southeast of Barbados. Embedded within the deep easterlies, the depression tracked west-northwestward at [...] Initially, moderate wind shear prevented strengthening, until a decrease <b>in</b> <b>shear</b> allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Andrew at 12:00UTC on August 17.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} upgrade, the {{depression}} {{began to turn}} west {{in response to a}} subtropical high to its north. The system then moved beneath an upper-level high, resulting in improved outflow and decreased wind shear. Following an increase in Dvorak classifications, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Storm Dinah on the evening of August21. Early the following day, the JMA also upped the cyclone into a tropical storm. However, strong wind shear prevented intensification at the climatological rate of one T number per day, as the storm passed roughly [...] south of Guam. Midday on August23, the JMA declared Dinah a severe tropical storm. Shortly after the upgrade, Dinah began to enter an area of lower shear, which accelerated intensification. After turning west-northwest and an increase in the storm's Dvorak intensity estimates, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded Dinah into a typhoon on the morning of August24. At the time of the upgrade, Dinah was located about [...] west of Guam. Despite a brief increase <b>in</b> <b>shear,</b> Dinah began to rapidly intensify over the ensuing 24hours.

Early on August26, the JTWC estimated that Dinah, while continuing northwest at a steady clip, obtained maximum sustained wind speed, with , making it a super typhoon. Even though data from the JTWC suggested that Dinah began to weaken almost immediately thereafter, the JMA estimated that Dinah reached its maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure of [...] and , respectively, at noon on August26.
