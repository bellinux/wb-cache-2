40|$|This paper empirically {{establishes}} {{the effect of}} the employer's term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> on the wage level of employees. The term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> is defined as the period an employer has to notify workers in advance of their up-coming dismissal. The wages paid during this period are an important element of firing costs and hence employment protection. To find a causal effect, I exploit the exogenous change in the term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> that resulted from the introduction of a new Dutch law in 1999. Strong evidence is found that a longer ‘dormant’ term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> leads to higher wages. In my sample, an additional month <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> increases wages by three percent, ceteris paribus. employment protection, wages, fixed effects...|$|R

40|$|Title: Comparison {{of legal}} {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination in the Czech Republic and Poland The {{aim of this}} master thesis is the comparison of legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment relationship in the Czech Republic and Poland. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination in these two states and in the end contains the comparison and evaluation of legal regulations concerned. The work consists of eight chapters, introduction and conclusion. The first chapter outlines the international and European legislation related to labour law with emphasis on termination of employment. The chapter contains a number of international conventions adopted in particular within the ILO as well as European legislation which deals with this issue. The second chapter contains treatise on termination of employment relationship in general, where the basic sources of national labour law in each country and a brief description of all forms of termination of employment relationship are stated. This chapter also contains {{a brief description of the}} relationship between civil and labour law and its development. The third chapter discusses the substantive aspects <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. This chapter, {{with the help of the}} case law, deals with formal and content page <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, her delivery, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination by employees and employers, prohibiting the possibility of [...] ...|$|R
