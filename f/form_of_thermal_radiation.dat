40|$|Accretion disks around {{black holes}} radiate a {{significant}} {{fraction of the}} rest mass of the accreting material in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> from within a few gravitational radii of the black hole (r ≲ 20 G M / c^ 2). In addition, the accreting matter may also be illuminated by hard X-rays from the surrounding plasma which adds fluorescent transition lines to the emission. This radiation is emitted by matter moving along geodesics in the metric, therefore the strong Doppler and gravitational redshifts observed in the emission encode information about the strong gravitational field around the black hole. In this paper {{the possibility of using}} the X-ray emission as a strong field test of General Relativity is explored by calculating the spectra for both the transition line and thermal emission from a thin accretion disk in a series of parametrically deformed Kerr metrics. In addition the possibility of constraining a number of known black hole spacetimes in alternative theories of gravity is considered.

30|$|Flow over a wedge {{has gained}} {{interest}} of many researchers {{due to the}} practical applications it has in polymer processes, cooling or heating of films/sheets, insulating materials, conveyor belts, cylinders and metallic plates. The seminal work regarding the flow over a wedge {{has been carried out}} by Falkner and Skan (1931). Their study considers a fixed wedge and the absence of any external forces. Hartree (1937) and Koh and Hartnett (1961), extended the idea of Falkner and Skan by considering the various factors involved, and, provided an extended solution to the traditional wedge problem. Suction/injection and variable wall temperature were the major factors considered by them. Magneto-hydrodynamic effects in the flow over a wedge were considered by Thakar and Pop (1984). Khan and Pop (2013) presented the boundary layer flow past a wedge moving in a nanofluid. Khan et al. (2015) used the Xue model to analyze the flow of carbon nanotubes suspended nanofluid over a static/moving wedge. Khan et al. (2015) used the nonlinear <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> to study the flow properties in a porous wedge under the influence of magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a classical configuration of conformal matter forming a naked singularity and discuss its subsequent Hawking evaporation {{within the context}} of two dimensional dilaton gravity. The one loop analysis is credible for a large mass naked singularity and suggests the existence of a weak cosmological censorship that would cause it to explode into radiation upon forming. The discrepancy between its classical and quantum histories seems to require a fundamental revision of our understanding of black hole physics. Perhaps more importantly, it raises serious questions of consistency and interpretation in quantum gravity. Hawking’s 1 pioneering discovery that a black hole is not in fact quite “black ” but, via quantum effects actually radiates away its energy in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> at a characteristic temperature, has inspired a great amount of work 2 attempting both to gain some insight into the ultimate fate of these objects and to understand the dilemma introduced by the apparent loss of quantum coherence 3 in the process. Most attempts have focused on toy models of two dimensional gravity, 4 some inspired by string theory, 5, 6 in the hope that some of these issues can be resolved while the theory yet retains some of the important features of its four dimensional (Einstein) counterpart. While black holes have receive...|$|E
40|$|The Earth’s climate, {{as well as}} {{planetary}} climates in general, is broadly {{regulated by}} three fundamental parameters: the total solar irradiance, the planetary albedo and the planetary emissivity. Observations from series of different satellites {{during the last three}} decades indicate that these three quantities are generally very stable. The total solar irradiation of some 1, 361 W/m 2 at 1 A. U. varies within 1 W/m 2 during the 11 -year solar cycle (Fröhlich 2012). The albedo is close to 29 % with minute changes from year to year but with marked zonal differences (Stevens and Schwartz 2012). The only exception to the overall stability is a minor decrease in the planetary emissivity (the ratio between the radiation to space and the radiation {{from the surface of the}} Earth). This is a consequence of the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas amounts making the atmosphere gradually more opaque to long-wave terrestrial radiation. As a consequence, radiation processes are slightly out of balance as less heat is leaving the Earth in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> than the amount of heat from the incoming solar radiation. Present space-based systems cannot yet measure this imbalance, but the effect can be inferred from the increase in heat in the oceans where most of the heat accumulates. Minor amounts of heat are used to melt ice and to warm the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{collapse}} of a self-gravitating thick shell of bosons coupled to a scalar radiation field. Due to the non-adiabaticity of the collapse, the shell (quantum) internal degrees of freedom absorb energy from the (classical) gravitational field and are excited. The excitation energy is then emitted in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> bursts <b>of</b> (<b>thermal)</b> <b>radiation</b> and the corresponding backreaction on the trajectory is estimated. It is clear that classical physics is not sufficient for a complete description of the gravitational collapse: firstly, the collapse ending into a point-like singularity is forbidden by the uncertainty principle; secondly, the backreaction of semiclassical effects (with matter evolving quantum mechanically on a classical space-time) such as the Hawking radiation 1 should be properly included 2. We have investigated the semiclassical limit for various models 3, 4 by employing a Born-Oppenheimer decomposition of the corresponding minisuperspace wavefunction 5. In particular 6, we considered the collapse in vacuum of a “macroshell ” made of N quantized “microsells”, each of which corresponding to a typical hadronic mass m ∼ 1 GeV s-wave scalar particle, with the proper mass of the macroshel...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conductive}} and convective <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> heat transfer, <b>thermal</b> <b>radiation</b> can {{be concentrated}} {{in a tiny}} spot by using reflecting mirrors. Concentrating solar power takes advantage of this fact. In many such systems, mirrors are employed to concentrate sunlight into a smaller area. Instead of mirrors, Fresnel lenses {{can also be used}} to concentrate heat flux. (In principle, any kind of lens can be used, but only the Fresnel lens design is practical for very large lenses.) Either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight. For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 Solar Power Plant, and during the day it can heat water to 285 °C (558.15 K) or 545 °F.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} of spacecraft {{is influenced by}} the solar absorptance and <b>thermal</b> emittance <b>of</b> the external spacecraft materials. Optical and thermal properties can degrade over time in the harsh low Earth orbital (LEO) space environment where spacecraft external materials are exposed to various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation,</b> <b>thermal</b> cycling, and atomic oxygen. Therefore, it is important to test the durability of spacecraft materials in the space environment. One objective of the Polymers and Zenith Polymers Experiments was to determine the effect of LEO space exposure on the optical properties of various spacecraft polymers. These experiments were flown as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 7 (MISSE 7) mission on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS) for 1. 5 years. Samples were flown in ram, wake or zenith directions, receiving varying amounts of atomic oxygen and solar radiation exposure. Total and diffuse reflectance and transmittance of flight and corresponding control samples were obtained post-flight using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer. Integrated air mass zero solar absorptance (s) of the flight and control samples were computed from the total transmittance and reflectance, and compared. The optical data are compared with similar polymers exposed to space for four years as part of MISSE 2, and with atomic oxygen erosion data, to help understand the degradation of these polymers in the space environment. Results show that prolonged space exposure increases the solar absorptance of some materials. Knowing which polymers remain stable will benefit future spacecraft design...|$|R
