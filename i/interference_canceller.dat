40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an {{iterative}} receiver {{derived from}} {{recent advances in}} narrowband turbo equalization for the multicode transmission scheme of the downlink of DS-CDMA systems with long scrambling sequences. The proposed scheme {{is based on a}} chip-rate linear equalizer exchanging soft information on the composite multiuser signal with the channel decoder in an iterative process.
