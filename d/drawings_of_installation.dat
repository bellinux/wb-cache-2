His aim when writing the novel was to make a complete brochure of all of Ukraine's ancient castles. He recorded more than 5000 objects when making the book. The system of his work was to identify the news writes up of the archival building and printed sources, the gathering of old plans, photos, <b>drawings,</b> the <b>installations</b> <b>of</b> expeditionary field survey of current state of photographic images sights, which produces graphic reconstructions of monuments and prepared the printed catalogue.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{upper and lower}} bounds on the area {{requirement}} <b>of</b> straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> n-node binary and ternary trees. Namely, we show algorithms for constructing order-preserving straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> binary trees in O(n^ 1. 5) area, straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> ternary trees in O(n^ 1. 631) area, and straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> complete ternary trees in O(n^ 1. 262) area. As far as we know, the ones we present are the first algorithms achieving sub-quadratic area for these problems. Further, for upward order-preserving straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> binary trees and for order-preserving straight-line orthogonal <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> ternary trees we provide Omega(n^ 2) area lower bounds, that we also prove to be tight. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} was reinvestigated as an {{aircraft}} powerplant through design study conducted {{to arrive at}} engine configurations and applicable advanced technologies. Two engines are discussed, a 300 kW six-cylinder engine for twin engine general aviation aircraft and a 150 kW four-cylinder engine for single engine aircraft. Descriptions of each engine include concept drawings, a performance analysis, stress and weight data, and a cost study. This information was used to develop two airplane concepts, a six-place twin and a four-place single engine aircraft. The aircraft study consists <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> <b>drawings,</b> computer generated performance data, aircraft operating costs, and <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> the resulting airplanes. The performance data show a vast improvement over current gasoline-powered aircraft...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor’s {{thesis is}} {{to deal with a}} part of the {{technological}} stage, which is the superstructure of the Emergency Medical Service of South Moravia region in Brno-Bohunice. The building is designed as four floor and the build-up area is 1997 m 2. The construction is designed as monolithic from reinforced concrete. First <b>of</b> all, <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> situation of the transport routes and a report of broad relation of transport routes are made. Secondly, the bill of quantities for the superstructure, two technologic specifications for the superstructure, the principles of organization of construction with drawing of site equipment and report of the site equipment are done. Last but not least, the time schedule, set of machinery, qualitative request and its ensuring, work safety rules and item budget for the superstructure are made. The result is accurate work procedure <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> formwork and concreting. Estimated price for constructions is 32 mil. and according to the time schedule the superstructure construction will take approximately eleven months...|$|R

40|$|A methodical {{design study}} was {{conducted}} to arrive at new diesel engine configurations and applicable advanced technologies. Two engines are discussed and the description of each engine includes concept drawings. A performance analysis, stress and weight prediction, and a cost study were also conducted. This information was then applied to two airplane concepts, a six-place twin and a four-place single engine aircraft. The aircraft study consisted <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> <b>drawings,</b> computer generated performance data, aircraft operating costs and <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> the resulting airplanes. The performance data shows a vast improvement over current gasoline-powered aircraft. At the completion of this basic study, the program was expanded to evaluate a third engine configuration. This third engine incorporates the best features of the original two, and its design is currently in progress. Preliminary information on this engine is presented...|$|R
40|$|We show three linear time {{algorithms}} {{for constructing}} planar straight-line grid <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> outerplanar graphs. The {{first and the}} second algorithm are for balanced outerplanar graphs. Both require linear area. The drawings produced by the first algorithm are not outerplanar while those produced by the second algorithm are. On the other hand, the first algorithm constructs drawings with better angular resolution. The third algorithm constructs outerplanar <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> general outerplanar graphs with O(n^ 1. 48) area. Further, we study the interplay between the area requirements <b>of</b> the <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> an outerplanar graph and the area requirements of a special class <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> its dual tree. ...|$|R

We also show that ∆ 2 + 1 edge slopes suffice for <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> general graphs, improving on the previous bound of ∆ + 1. Furthermore, we improve previous upper bounds on the number of slopes needed for planar <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> planar and bipartite planar graphs...|$|R
