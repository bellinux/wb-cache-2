40|$|At {{the basis}} of conceiving the tax policy of an European Union member state, one must consider, on the one hand, {{fulfilling}} the government's own requirements, {{and on the other}} hand, achieving the objectives set by the EC Treaty. At present, the European Union has a quite harmonized and coordinated tax policy in the indirect taxes field, and partially in the direct taxes field, based on the free movement principle of goods, services, capital and labour; thus, although the member states have the freedom to set operation rules of their own national tax systems, this freedom is conditioned by the compliance with the priority objectives of the founding treaties of the European Union. The member states should avoid adopting <b>discriminating</b> <b>tax</b> measures (which could lead to a disadvantageous treatment for the persons, goods and services or capitals coming from other member states). Sometimes, the restrictions regarding free movement on the internal market are generated by the differences between the national tax systems, so that a certain degree of tax harmonization at the European Union level is necessary. The tax harmonization can be achieved either spontaneously (by means of the forces of the market), by means of active actions {{at the level of the}} European Union (the implementation of common policies, the coordination of the policies, the harmonization of the legislation, etc.) or by means of the passive actions of the European Court of Justice (the interdiction of certain types of conduct of the member states that do not comply with the norms of the European Union). In the absence of the tax harmonization, negative effects can occur, such as: the erosion of the national tax bases, provision of public services and goods at a sub-optimal level, unwanted changes in the structure of the taxes which are levied in the member states, and distortions in assigning resources at the level of the single market...|$|E

40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} use targeted tax {{policies to}} trade off the gains from increased FDI against {{the cost of}} excessive profit shifting by multinational firms. We show that optimal tax systems generally incorporate both thin capitalization rules, which <b>tax</b> <b>discriminate</b> between purely national and multinational firms, and controlled-foreign-company (CFC) rules, which discriminate between home-based and foreign-based multinationals. Introducing CFC rules is optimal if investment elasticities of home-based and foreign-based multinationals differ due to transaction costs for FDI. We also analyze the effects of reduced transaction costs for FDI and reduced costs for debt shifting on the optimal policy mix. Our results support the recent development of these anti-avoidance rules in OECD countries...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact on}} regional welfare of policy competition for FDI when a multinational firm can strategically react to differences in statutory corporate tax rates and shift taxable profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. We show that competing governments may {{have an incentive to}} <b>tax</b> <b>discriminate</b> between domestic and multi-national firms even in the presence of profit shifting opportunities for the latter. In particular, tax competition leads to higher welfare for the region as a whole than lump-sum subsidy competition when the difference in statutory corporate tax rates and/or their average is high enough. We also find that policy competition increases regional welfare by changing the firm’s investment decision when profit shifting mo-tivations might induce the firm to locate in the least profitable country...|$|R
5000|$|The treaty next {{required}} that the tax revenues for the financing of this budget would be levied [...] "...equally in all united provinces, {{and at the same}} rate.". Furthermore, it prohibited internal tariffs and other <b>taxes</b> <b>discriminating</b> against residents of other provinces. Alas, these two latter provisions were never implemented. Instead, the provinces continued the practice under the Habsburg rulers that the provinces paid a fixed quotum (the repartitie) of the budget. Holland's contribution was the norm from which the contributions of other provinces were derived. After some changes the quota were fixed in 1616 as follows (to remain unchanged till 1792): Friesland one-fifth of Holland's share; Zeeland (after some diligent bargaining) 16 percent; Utrecht and Groningen one-tenth each; Gelderland 9.6 percent; Overijssel 6.1 percent; and Drenthe (though not represented in the States-General) 1 percent.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the impact on}} regional welfare of policy com-petition for FDI when a multinational firm can strategically react to differences in statutory corporate tax rates and shift taxable profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. We show that competing governments {{have an incentive to}} <b>tax</b> <b>discriminate</b> between do-mestic and multinational firms even in the presence of profit shifting opportunities for the latter. In particular, tax competition for FDI ends in a tax holiday which makes the multinational firm declare to the host country’s tax authorities as much of its profits as it can. Such a tax holiday eliminates the distortions arising from cross-country statutory tax rate differentials and induces the firm to invest in the location-advantageous country. In such a scenario, policy competition is shown to increase regional welfare when the statutory tax rate difference is large enough...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} two-good model of price {{competition}} where some consumers visit all {{the shops and}} others visit only one. We find that, in the Nash Equilibrium, the information frictions lead to price dispersion. When the goods are complements their prices will be negatively correlated so {{if one of them}} is priced high then the other one is at a discount. This finding is supported by the empirical observation that simultaneous price discounts of complements are infrequent. If the goods are substitutes then their prices will be uncorrelated, rationalizing the lack of evidence on their co-pricing. When selling complements, retailers earn higher profits than in the one-good model by <b>discriminating</b> consumers through <b>taxing</b> captives with high overall price tag and attracting shoppers by pricing one of the goods aggressively. This strategy does not yield additional profits for substitutes because captives will switch to buying only the aggressively-priced good...|$|R

It is imposed on income from portfolio investment, such as interest and dividends, but also on gains from stock sales.

The withholding tax has serious conceptual weaknesses that cause a massive misallocation of capital and thus a lasting damage to growth in Germany.

40|$|I want {{to thank}} Block and Willett (1) for their {{comments}} on my paper (2). Their remarks are substantial, thoughtful and they help us to discuss more profoundly {{one example of a}} food tax, the tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs). Indeed, not all food taxes are created equal and next to a more general debate, we need to discuss into details every kind of attempt to tackle the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Though SSBs were not in particular what I had in mind, of course they are included in the debate. Let me reply to some of their arguments, given the limited word count of this format. I want to apologize {{for not being able to}} get into all of the arguments. The “strong evidence” Block and Willett relied upon, needs careful interpretation. Looking after evidence on the effects of taxes, it is almost exclusively based on simulation studies which only predict (‘likely effect’) and therefore inherently neglect the complexity of real life situations. As Hawkes has demonstrated (3), current evidence does not leave the uncertainty behind us. While we are talking about the complex cross-section of many areas and disciplines, the awareness of this complexity seems to be absent in their suggestions. They righteously stated that “no policy is viewed in isolation” but looking after arguments, they quoted many trials which did isolate the topic of SSBs to predict the effect. We should be very careful in interpreting predictions. Duffey et al., in a longitudinal study that laid bare some tendencies but with modest conclusions which was quoted by the Block and Willett, explicitly warned the reader for hasty conclusions: “Although price policies, such as taxation, are beginning to be used as a means of addressing obesity, diabetes, and other nutrition-related health concerns, minimal research has been done to study how these price changes would have an impact on health outcomes (4). ” Also Lin et al. warned us not to forget the complexity of real world consumption strategies (5). Obese groups, for instance, respond less to changes in price relative to people with healthy weights, to mention only one aspect (6). Others warn us that, despite the evidence, the decrease of consumption of SSBs, the testing effect is often weak (7). Though a potential means to counter health problems, often food <b>taxes</b> <b>discriminate</b> because they are equal for all. The difficulty of food taxes is that they tax on consumption while overconsumption often is the problem, next a complete lack of physical activity. Of course, some food has almost no nutritional value, but we should also think of for instance a marathon runner: he or she needs SSBs to recover from many miles. Why should someone with a healthy lifestyle be discriminated? And if we exclude sports drinks from the taxes, then we have a perfect substitution for SSBs, a problem Block and Willett seem to minimalize. If I referred to taxes as a new holy grail, I particularly had in mind the recent initiatives in many European countries, where food taxes are used to solve state deficits. Taxes can only be introduced when all other strategies have failed. Next to prevention and education—which are still underused means to tackle health problems—, e. g. offering a systematic alternative to SSBs (free tap water) is a serious option when it comes down to rather isolated environments such as schools, offices, etc (8). Evidently, when based in strong evidence and implemented in a socially non-discriminative way, taxes on SSBs could be of help as just one measure in the global fight against non-communicable diseases...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{deconstruct}} the underlying reasons for why educational reform in urban areas has been unsuccessful in providing quality education, stimulating higher academic achievement and mitigating poor school conditions. This paper approaches the topic as a multi-dimensional and complex debate, in which the nuances, complexities, tensions and ideological contradictions that surround the issue, must be analyzed, understood and eventually dismantled. Educational reform in urban areas is intertwined with issues of race and class, and political influence and power. This analysis attempts to put such issues in a historical and social context in order to shed light on why it often invokes heated conflict, as well as the obstacles that have impeded substantive change and how to confront them. For this purpose, I have chosen to focus on the history of education reform in New Jersey, where over the past 30 years it has been debated in the state Supreme Court. The landmark case, Abbott v. Burke, established that school funding reliant on property <b>taxes</b> <b>discriminated</b> against urban students and ruled that inner-city conditions warranted aid that exceeded that of suburban districts. Decisions have faced intense political backlash, and are now facing termination as the New Jersey Governor, Jon Corzine, has proposed a new funding formula that rescinds the current system sensitive to urban specific disadvantages. The first chapter addresses the nature of the problem, in that urban schools have consistently been unable to compete with their rural and suburban counterparts, and that national studies have shown that poverty alone cannot account for the performance gap. The chapter discusses the making of the modem American city, the importance of location in the unequal public education systems and how ideologies have played an important role that demands consideration, in reform policies. Chapter two analyzes how schools are funded; it is determined that since the majority of funding is from districts' property tax revenue, state aid often has failed to offset the disparities that exist between communities. It discusses the wave of finance reform litigation that began in the 1970 's and its success in narrowing the funding gap and shifting the focus to providing urban areas with equity plus, meaning funding parity with successful, suburban districts, in addition to supplementary funding to alleviate disadvantages. This chapter concludes by introducing the cases in New Jersey and their significance. The third chapter looks at the evolution of New Jersey's demographic and economic profile, and how it is analogous to the nation's. It also analyzes the direct link between the decay of New Jersey's cities and the characteristics of school enrollment, the conditions of schools and the achievement of students. Chapter four explains the Abbott reforms, what they were designed to address and their goals. It analyzes the breakdown of implementation, as a result of unintended consequences, costs and risks and political feasibility. The chapter evaluates the progress of the reforms {{not only in terms of}} finance and standardized test scores, but also in terms of social significance. The fifth chapter explains the new funding formula and its goals and provisions. It analyzes projected outcomes and possible pitfalls, as well as the social implications. The chapter also attempts to deconstruct the public's flawed perceptions that incited opposition against the Abbott districts and illustrate how they are mirrored in the national trends that have hindered progressive policies that could create significant and structural change. The conclusion calls on the public and politicians to recognize the contradictions between American ideologies of equal access and the belief in the capitalist market and how they have prevented the government from creating policies that would significantly alter the structure of public school systems in urban areas. It also challenges policymakers to address the social and historical context of America's inner cities and asserts change both nationally and in New Jersey can only be achieved when the reality of urban areas are understood and flawed perceptions about the urban 'underclass' are dismantled...|$|R
