25|$|In 2008, {{there was}} a change from the collegial model to {{management}} model {{with the introduction of}} outcomes based BPR. AAU expanded administrative posts to create a reform office and five vice-presidents. Previous faculties and schools were combined into seven colleges headed by directors reporting to the president. Faculty or school deans reported to vice-presidents. Colleges had greater autonomy from the central administration <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> their budgets and organizing activities. However, this did not reduce the high ratio of support staff (60%) to academic staff (40%).|$|E
25|$|Advaitins have {{traditionally}} challenged the Buddhist influence thesis. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada {{was influenced by}} Buddhism, at least <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.|$|E

25|$|Operations {{management}} {{is an area}} of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations {{is one of the major}} functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services.|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> such a plan, unlike an HMO plan, {{which has}} a copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment {{generally}} paid {{at the time of}} service), a PPO generally does not have a copayment but offers a deductible and a coinsurance feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. After the deductible is met, the coinsurance benefits apply. If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, the patient pays 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. The insurer will pay 80% of the other fees, and the patient will pay the remaining 20%. [...] Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but written off as a discount by the physician.|$|E
