500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction we got in the US blew me away. I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E
500|$|In 2001 the Workshop {{introduced}} Sesame English, {{a series}} focused on teaching {{children and their}} families the basics of the English language and on familiarizing them with some aspects of American culture. As of 2009 it aired in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Italy. In 2003, in response to the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, the co-producers of Takalani Sesame included the first preschool AIDS/HIV curriculum. They created the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, to confront the stigma of HIV and AIDS in South Africa. According to the documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop.

500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E

30|$|And yet nothing {{whatsoever}} {{in democratic}} theory entitles {{us to the}} assumption that such a provisional consensus will emerge. On the contrary, democratic theory, on its own, should lead us to the opposite expectation. After all, it’s the first premise of all democratic theory that people diverge in their preferences. People differ in their interests, their identities, their religious beliefs, and we need democracy precisely to reach decisions {{in the face of}} these “facts of pluralism”. 3 Yet all of these reasons for <b>expecting</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have diverging preferences about policy are also, prima facie, reasons for <b>expecting</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have diverging preferences about the units of democracy. In order to get democracy off the ground, we need to somehow combine diverging preferences about policy with converging preferences about units.|$|R

2500|$|Along with André Brink and Breyten Breytenbach, Coetzee was, {{according}} to Fred Pfeil, at [...] "the {{forefront of the}} anti-apartheid movement within Afrikaner literature and letters". On accepting the Jerusalem Prize in 1987, Coetzee spoke {{of the limitations of}} art in South African society, whose structures had resulted in [...] "deformed and stunted relations between human beings" [...] and [...] "a deformed and stunted inner life". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "South African literature is a literature in bondage. It is a less than fully human literature. It is exactly the kind of literature you would <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> write from prison". He called on the South African government to abandon its apartheid policy. Scholar Isidore Diala states that J. M. Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer and André Brink are [...] "three of South Africa's most distinguished white writers, all with definite anti-apartheid commitment".|$|E
2500|$|Diving cliffs: The {{area around}} Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid {{out like a}} kind of grotto, with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving cliffs—one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m)—above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be {{swimming}} in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> dive in right next to them - or right on top of them. [...] The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions. Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white {{to make it easier to}} spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes. Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Colin Mackerras states, [...] "There {{was a major}} {{rebellion}} against Chinese rule in Tibet in March 1959, which was put down {{with the cost of}} much bloodshed and lasting bitterness {{on the part of the}} Tibetans." [...] The Tibetan government-in-exile reports variously, 85,000, 86,000, and 87,000 deaths for Tibetans during the rebellion, attributed to [...] "secret Chinese documents captured by guerrillas". Tibetologist Tom Grunfeld said [...] "the veracity of such a claim is difficult to verify." [...] Warren W. Smith, a writer with Radio Free Asia, writes that the [...] "secret documents" [...] came from a 1960 PLA report captured by guerrillas in 1966, with the figures first published by the TGIE in India in 1990. Smith states that the documents said that 87,000 [...] "enemies were eliminated", but he does not take [...] "eliminated" [...] to mean [...] "killed", as the TGIE does. A Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) official surnamed Samdup released a report for Asia Watch after three fact-finding missions from 1979 to 1981, stating that a speech by premier Zhou Enlai, published in Beijing Review in 1980, confirmed the 87,000 figure. Demographer Yan Hao could find no reference to any such figure in the published speech, and concluded, [...] "If these TGIE sources are not reluctant to fabricate Chinese sources in open publications, how can they <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> believe in their citations of so-called Chinese secret internal documents and speeches that are never available in originals to independent researchers?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Featuring the {{portrait}} of an individual on a coin, which became legal in 44 BC, caused the coin {{to be viewed as}} embodying the attributes of the individual portrayed. Dio wrote that following the death of Caligula the Senate demonetized his coinage, and ordered that they be melted. Regardless of whether or not this actually occurred, it demonstrates the importance and meaning that was attached to the imagery on a coin. The philosopher Epictetus jokingly wrote: [...] "Whose image does this sestertius carry? Trajan's? Give it to me. Nero's? Throw it away, it is unacceptable, it is rotten." [...] Although the writer did not seriously <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get rid of their coins, this quotation demonstrates that the Romans attached a moral value to the images on their coins. Unlike the obverse, which during the imperial period almost always featured a portrait, the reverse was far more varied in its depiction. During the late Republic there were often political messages to the imagery, especially during the periods of civil war. However, {{by the middle of the}} Empire, although there were types that made important statements, and some that were overtly political or propagandistic in nature, the majority of the types were stock images of personifications or deities. While some images can be related to the policy or actions of a particular emperor, many of the choices seem arbitrary and the personifications and deities were so prosaic that their names were often omitted, as they were readily recognizable by their appearance and attributes alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was featured in}} various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; {{and the death of}} her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, [...] "you don't <b>expect</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we knew she was going to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in the {{recording}} process, Kerrang! reported that the band's new album would be released sometime in 2010. Towards the end of {{the recording}} process, Gaskarth said the album would be released in January 2011. On August 17, a demo was posted online of the track [...] "Actors". Gaskarth said he posted it because he [...] "thought people should hear it." [...] He said that the song wouldn't fit on Dirty Work since it [...] "didn't represent the theme of the new album closely enough." [...] After appearing at Reading and Leeds Festivals in August, the band returned to the studio to finalise the album's track listing in September. In October and November, the band went on a headlining club tour in the US with support from A Rocket to the Moon and City (Comma) State. The band held a contest where five fans could hear the new album at each stop on the tour. On October 18, the album's title as revealed: Dirty Work. In November, Barakat revealed that the album's release date had been pushed back to early spring and {{that the majority of the}} album's songs were mixed. In December, [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] was made available for streaming. In January 2011, Gaskarth said the group were sorting out the track order and working on the album's artwork. He also said that the album was originally going to be released in the same month, [...] "but now it looks like we’re going to have to push it back" [...] and were aiming for its release between January and March. During an interview in early February, Gaskarth stated that the band were currently approving artwork.
