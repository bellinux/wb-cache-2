40|$|Anthropogenic {{structures}} fragment river connectivity, impeding {{the migration}} of diadromous fish between essential habitats. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> are used worldwide primarily for flood protection and land reclamation by closing under hydraulic pressure during the flood tide and opening when head differential is sufficient during the <b>ebb.</b> Although <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> are known to decrease fish species richness, abundance, and movement, their impacts on {{the migration of}} ecologically and socioeconomically important diadromous fish in terms of passage efficiency and delay have not been reported elsewhere. Acoustic and passive integrated transponder telemetry revealed that passage efficiencies of upstream migrating adult brown trout, Salmo trutta (92 %), and downstream migrating juvenile sea trout smolts (96 - 100 %) and adult European eel, Anguilla anguilla (98 %), were high at top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in two small English streams. However, these fish experienced delay at the gates (adult brown trout, median = 6. 0 h; sea trout smolts, mean = 6. 5 and 23. 7 h; eels, mean = 66. 2 h) when compared to migration through unimpeded reaches. The percentage of time the gates were closed and mean angle of opening were positively related to delay in both species and life stages. Diel periodicity also influenced delay for smolts and eels, which were more active at night. For adult trout, water temperature was positively associated with delay. Upstream and downstream water temperature and salinity were influenced by the temporal operation of the gates. Orifices installed in the gates did not mitigate delay for adult or juvenile trout. For adult eels, delay was decreased when an orifice was operational, although this coincided with more eels first approaching the gates when open, higher tides and greater saline intrusion upstream of the gates. When gates were open, fish would not pass immediately through, indicating the potential influence of a behavioural avoidance component. To {{examine the effect of}} hydrodynamics created by top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with different aperture sizes, wild sea trout smolt behaviour was observed by video cameras in an experimental flume at night. Avoidance responses occurred within an average of 1. 4 fish body lengths upstream of the gate. Fish were more likely to exhibit avoidance (switch in orientation from negative to positive rheotaxis, increased tail beat frequency and/or retreat upstream) in the vicinity of a model gate with a smaller angle of opening and passage aperture. Overall, top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> delayed the migration of diadromous fish, potentially increasing energy expenditure and predation risk. Delay was not decreased by orifices. Modifying or replacing top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with designs that allow them to open wider and for longer could reduce migratory delay and improve the environmental conditions that cause behavioural avoidance. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in April 2016 at the Strait of Bengkalis, Riau Province. The aim of research {{is to determine the}} pattern salinity and temperature distribution at <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> and flood tide. Research used survey method.

Based on the research it showed that average salinity at flood tide 23. 56 ‰ and <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> 22. 90 ‰. The average of salinity at <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> was lower than flood tide. In contrast to the temperature, the temperature measurement at flood <b>tide</b> lower than <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> and the average value at flood tide 31, 18 ºC and <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> was 31, 53 ºC. The results showed that distribution of salinity and temperature during flood <b>tide</b> and <b>ebb</b> <b>tide</b> is fluctuated.

40|$|The Peel-Harvey Estuary in {{south-western}} Australia {{became so}} eutrophic in the 1970 s and 1980 s that a radical approach was adopted {{in order to}} increase tidal exchange between this estuary and the ocean and thereby flush greater volumes of nutrients out to sea. This involved constructing a deep artificial (Dawesville) channel between the estuary and the ocean, at a location ca. 15 km south of the shallower and natural (Mandurah) channel. Samples of fish larvae were collected monthly throughout 1997 to determine whether the characteristics of the ichthyoplankton on flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> differed within and between channels and whether they underwent the same types of intra-annual changes in the two channels. In both channels, the number of species and concentration of larvae were both significantly greater on flood than <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> and the species composition differed significantly between tides. The concentrations of larvae were at their greatest, by far, between early spring and early autumn. Flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in both channels were dominated by the goby Favonigobius lateralis, which was transported out on <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> as preflexion larvae and subsequently brought back on flood tides as postflexion larvae. The larvae of Hyperlophus vittatus, Pseudorhombus jenynsii and Rhabdosargus sarba, which spawn outside the estuary, were far more abundant on flood than <b>ebb</b> <b>tides,</b> whereas the reverse pertained with Atherinosoma elongata, Apogon rueppellii and Pseudogobius olorum, which spawn within the estuary. In contrast to the situation with the diversity and concentration of larvae, the species composition on both flood and <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> differed significantly between channels. However, the latter differences were small and mainly due to relatively greater numbers of larval F. lateralis on <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in the Mandurah Channel and the very occasional occurrence of reef species on flood tides in the Dawesville Channel. During the year, the species composition underwent cyclical changes on both tides and in both channels, due to out of phase sequential monthly changes in the concentrations of certain species...|$|R

30|$|Most fish {{mentioned}} above decreased in density during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> at the intertidal stations (W and L). However, although the water depth at W also decreased during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides,</b> as at L, some deeper tidal creeks or burrows (depth, 0.3 to 1.0  m) in these meadows maintained sufficient water volume for some fish inhabitance. Indeed, {{we did find}} many fish still residing within these shallow areas at W {{as long as there}} is space for them to move, while most of these fish were absent at L during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides.</b> We postulate that these refuges may serve as important temporary shelters for fish in intertidal zones when neighboring areas are exposed to the air. These fish may stay in these shallow water refuges during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides</b> in order to avoid predators. The water columns here may support sufficient volume for scarids, lethrinids, and lutjanids, but are too shallow for large piscivores, such as lemon sharks, which are the main predators of these fish; lemon sharks were absent in intertidal zones during <b>ebb</b> <b>tides.</b> Similar shallow water usage patterns were documented for L. fulviflamma in tropical seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean (Dorenbosch et al. 2004) across the tidal cycle. Moreover, for scarids, staying in these shallow refuges not only allows them to avoid predators but also permits them to forage on the more nutritionally-rich seagrass shoots that are found in these shallow areas (Lee et al. in review).|$|R
