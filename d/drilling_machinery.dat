Men with pickaxes and mules and wagons had long been the means of locating and moving the coal to the surface.

500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral <b>drilling,</b> special <b>machinery</b> can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|R

5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic <b>drilling</b> <b>machinery</b> in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|E

We started our assignment with the calculation of the heat losses. The heating installation {{needs to be able to}} overcome these losses in the worst possible weather situation. So this value defines the whole installation. The next step was to calculate how much panels we needed, and to determine which model of the radiant panels was most suitable. When this was done, we could start with the actual design of the installation. We chose to divide the factory into ten zones which can be heated separately. We made a division of 5 times 3 radiators, and 5 times 2. By doing this we used more piping, but we achieved a system that is easier to regulate. This is necessary is when the factory is not fully occupied. After this we determined the material and the dimensions of the piping, and the valves needed for the regulation of the systems. These factors cause a pressure drop in the system. Therefore it is needed to calculate this pressure drop, and to choose a pump capable to withstand this.

40|$|Drilling and Blasting is {{a common}} {{technique}} of tunnel driving, either for mining or civil purposes, at least for lengths shorter than 3 - 4 km. The technology is surely "mature", hence it offers a huge variety of cases to be analyzed. The report deals with {{the subject of the}} compliance of the actual blasting results with the design requirements (contour and pull). Three factors are obviously involved: explosive, rock and drilling; the main objective of the report is to asses in some simple cases the relative importance of each of them, and to describe a simple methodology to do that. A number of rounds in mine drifting operations, covering a variety of rock-drilling system-explosive assortments have been carefully surveyed; rock shows important differences from one site to another with respect to the quality class; drilling is performed with manually steered jumbo in some drifts, with computerized jumbo in other drifts; the general blasting pattern is not different from one site to another, but at places pipe charges are used in contour holes, at places fully coupled charges. The evaluation of the influence of the rock on the excavation difficulty is another objective of the study. Difficulty can be inferred from specific drilling work consumption, specific explosive consumption or from both. Drilling consumption, which means the relative fineness of explosive distribution in the rock-mass required in order to obtain a satisfactory blast, has been assumed to be a reliable criterion {{on the basis of the}} narrower dispersion of the data, with respect to explosive consumption. Being the study aimed to classify by relative difficulty the rock types, rather than the operations, the effect of the cross section (whose influence on specific consumption by far exceeds the one of rock type) has to be accounted for by normalizing consumptions, i. e. by defining a normal cross section v/ specific consumption correlation, to be used as a reference line. Rock classes are related to difficulty classes; a wide dispersion is still observable, which indicates that the rock designation criterion based on lithological type should be improved by adding at least a second descriptive element. Anyhow, the simple lithological designation provides a first approximation ranking of the rocks to the intended purpose. The sensitivity of the pattern performances to drilling precision is analyzed in the same way. Tolerance standards for <b>drilling</b> <b>machinery</b> related to drilling pattern features are proposed. Data collected to establish the quality of the results of the blasts are: the overbreak value, the efficiency (actual pull/design pull ratio), the half cast factor of the contour holes. The relationships linking these indicators of quality to the features of the rock, of the drilling system and of the charging are analyzed and discussed. The statistical basis of the study is provided by data collected from a large number of cases, obtained from technical literature and from on site inspections. Analysis has been carried out on rounds of variable cross sections (from few to 160 m 3), with either parallel or inclined hole cuts, blasted using a wide range of explosives and ignition systems. A general methodology to establish the main reasons of observed inaccuracies and to foresee the consequences of changes in the drilling and blasting practice is presented in the conclusion...|$|E
