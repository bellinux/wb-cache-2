5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

5|$|The Aegean Sea setting {{includes}} {{a mass of}} shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Lost Souls, a vast and windy <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E

50|$|Hot desert climates can {{be found}} in the <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> North Africa such as the wide Sahara Desert, the Libyan Desert or the Nubian Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> the Horn of Africa such as the Danakil Desert or the Grand Bara Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> Southern Africa such as the Namib Desert or the Kalahari Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> the Middle East such as the Arabian Desert, the Syrian Desert or the Lut Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> South Asia such as Dasht-e Kavir, Dasht-e Loot, or the Thar Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> the United States and Mexico such as the Mojave Desert, the Sonoran Desert or the Chihuahuan Desert; <b>deserts</b> <b>of</b> Australia such as the Simpson Desert or the Great Victoria Desert and many other regions. Only one region in Europe has a hot desert climate, the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park in Almería and a small area in the {{southwest}} of Murcia and Alicante, Spain. Hot <b>deserts</b> are lands <b>of</b> extremes: most of them are the hottest, the driest and the sunniest places on Earth because of nearly constant high pressure; the nearly permanent removal of low pressure systems, dynamic fronts and atmospheric disturbances; sinking air motion; dry atmosphere near the surface and aloft; the exacerbated exposure to the sun where solar angles are always high.|$|R
5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first {{published}} in 1960. Set in a Catholic monastery in the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> the Southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war, the story spans thousands of years as civilization rebuilds itself. The monks of the fictional Albertian Order of Leibowitz take up the mission of preserving the surviving remnants of man's scientific knowledge until the day the outside world is again ready for it.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|From January 12, 1880 to May 12, 1880, Carpenter {{directed}} scouting missions {{into the}} isolated Chinati Mountains bordering the United States with Mexico. The surrounding {{area on the}} American side was the high <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> far West Texas. This is where Victorio and other Apaches had been making raids. These scouts helped provide the first reliable maps drawn {{in the areas of}} operation. Finding waterholes and mapping the area was a critical step in Victorio campaign.|$|E

5|$|Justinian and {{his successors}} modernized {{frontier}} fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) in the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome {{is unusual in}} that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which was rare in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E

5|$|The Vana Parva {{book of the}} Mahabharata narrates that an asura (demon) named Dhundhu {{lived under}} the sands of the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> Ujjalaka, in Marudhanva. Dhundu terrorized the whole world. Upset by Dhundu's action, Uttanka– whose ashram was in Ujjalaka– {{performed}} tapas (austerities) dedicated to Vishnu. Pleased, Vishnu told Uttanka that the Ikshvaku king Kulavalashva would slay the demon. The sage went to the king's palace and recounted Vishnu's prophecy. Kuvalasva and his sons went to the forest and killed the demon. As a result, Kulavalashva became known as Dhundhumara, the slayer of Dhundhu.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by David Mould and {{was shot in the}} <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Tabernas in Spain. The music video features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover. The video is set in non-linear structure, as it opens with Minogue and Fletcher in a blue cadillac at a gas station, with Minogue staring inside the gas station while Fletcher sits in the car after being released from jail. Several scenes feature Minogue and Fletcher in different outfits in different areas, driving and running around a hotel. There are scenes with Minogue and Fletcher fighting, being happy and playing around in there hotel room.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of known Tarbosaurus fossils were recovered from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The Subashi Formation, in which Shanshanosaurus remains were discovered, is also Maastrichtian in age.|$|E

5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} to craft the props. The costumes {{were designed by}} Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> Rajasthan, wearing full armour.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who {{has turned to}} hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{enters the}} <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Lost Souls, and Athena tells him Pandora's Box is {{hidden in a}} temple chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos—a {{punishment}} by Zeus for Cronos' role in the Great War. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, aware of his former servant's success, kills Kratos as the latter is leaving the Temple. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles his way through the fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) {{graduated}} {{the following}} notable alumni who {{made significant contributions}} to the aerospace field. The school's mission is to produce experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems. The school was established on September 9, 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951 to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave <b>Desert</b> <b>of</b> Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} was {{contingency}} training, {{which focused on}} astronauts learning the skills required to survive if the landing did not occur where planned. The group started their training by being dropped off {{in the middle of}} the jungle in Panama. They performed the survival training in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the <b>desert</b> <b>of</b> Reno, Nevada. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.|$|E
