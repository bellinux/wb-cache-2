5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of <b>emboli</b> arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary <b>emboli</b> may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are caused by}} damage from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other <b>emboli</b> consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions are {{deemed to be}} at risk from brain <b>emboli.</b> They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air <b>emboli</b> are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary <b>emboli</b> (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other <b>emboli</b> consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was {{temporarily}} relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army, BSquadron {{was attached to}} the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from <b>Emboli</b> to the Arno River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, moving with the division to Iesi on the Adriatic. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to Fano on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini, advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility. Wilder Force was re-formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine-gun platoon and it began crossing the Fiumicino River on 15 October. Four days later, Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles. On 21 October, B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around Pisignano and were within a mile of the town {{by the end of the}} day. Since it was strongly held by the Axis, the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew.|$|E
25|$|In {{anterograde}} embolism, {{the movement}} of <b>emboli</b> is {{in the direction of}} blood flow. In retrograde embolism, however, the <b>emboli</b> move in opposition to the blood flow direction; this is usually significant only in blood vessels with low pressure (veins) or with <b>emboli</b> of high weight.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{an episode}} of {{cholesterol}} <b>emboli</b> is generally symptomatic, i.e. it deals with the symptoms and complications but cannot reverse the phenomenon itself. In kidney failure resulting from cholesterol crystal <b>emboli,</b> statins (medication that reduces cholesterol levels) {{have been shown to}} halve the risk of requiring hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary <b>emboli</b> {{occur in}} more than 600,000 people in the United States each year. It results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths {{per year in the}} United States. The risk in those who are hospitalized is around 1%. The rate of fatal {{pulmonary}} <b>emboli</b> has declined from 6% to 2% over the last 25 years in the United States.|$|E
25|$|All {{patients}} should be monitored for signs of complicated infection, continued sepsis, or septic <b>emboli</b> while antibiotic therapy is being administered.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. <b>Emboli</b> to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). <b>Emboli</b> to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. <b>Emboli</b> to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The risk of <b>emboli</b> {{forming in}} AF depends on {{other risk factors}} such as age, hypertension, diabetes, recent heart failure, or {{previous}} stroke.|$|E
25|$|Obstruction of {{pulmonary}} arteries due to <b>emboli</b> from dying worms is {{more likely}} to be fatal in cats than dogs because of less collateral circulation and fewer vessels.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} unusual (25% {{of the total}} number of cases) for cholesterol <b>emboli</b> to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as vascular surgery or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or thrombolytic medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol <b>emboli</b> by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of <b>emboli</b> {{are from}} {{proximal}} leg deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. DVTs {{are at risk}} for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. The conditions are generally regarded as a continuum termed venous thromboembolism (VTE).|$|E
25|$|If <b>emboli</b> {{have spread}} to the {{digestive}} tract, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting may occur, as well as nonspecific abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (vomiting blood, or admixture {{of blood in the}} stool), and occasionally acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).|$|E
25|$|Osler's nodes {{are raised}} tender nodules on the pulps of {{fingertips}} or toes, an autoimmune vasculitis that is suggestive of subacute bacterial endocarditis. They are usually painful, {{as opposed to}} Janeway lesions which are due to <b>emboli</b> and are painless.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emboli</b> most {{commonly}} {{arise from the}} heart (especially in atrial fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an atrial or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{prosthetic}} valves {{also carry}} {{a significant increase}} in risk of thromboembolism. Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (mitral or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous <b>emboli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary <b>emboli</b> affect about 430,000 {{people each}} year in Europe. In the United States between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year, which results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths. Rates are similar in males and females. They become more common as people get older.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the pleurae {{known as}} {{pleurisy}} can rarely {{give rise to}} shrinking lung syndrome. SLE can cause pleuritic pain and also give rise to shrinking lung syndrome, involving a reduced lung volume. Other associated lung conditions include pneumonitis, chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary <b>emboli,</b> and pulmonary hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|ECG {{findings}} {{associated with}} pulmonary <b>emboli</b> may suggest worse prognosis since the six findings identified with RV strain on ECG (heart rate > 100 beats per minute, S1Q3T3, inverted T waves in leads V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, complete right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation) {{are associated with}} increased risk of circulatory shock and death.|$|E
25|$|Thrombus {{formation}} {{can also}} take place within the ventricles, and it occurs in approximately 30% of anterior-wall myocardial infarctions, compared with only 5% of inferior ones. Some other risk factors are poor ejection fraction (<35%), size of infarct, {{and the presence of}} AF. In the first three months after infarction, left-ventricle aneurysms have a 10% risk of <b>emboli</b> forming.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of embolisation of cholesterol was first {{recognized by the}} Danish pathologist Dr. Peter Ludvig Panum and published in 1862. Further evidence that eroded atheroma {{was the source of}} <b>emboli</b> came from American pathologist Dr. Curtis M. Flory, who in 1945 reported the phenomenon in 3.4% of a large autopsy series of older individuals with severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.|$|E
25|$|The data {{published}} by the WHI suggested supplemental estrogen increased risk of venous <b>emboli</b> and breast cancer but was protective against osteoporosis and colorectal cancer, while the impact on cardiovascular disease was mixed. These results were later confirmed in trials from the United Kingdom, but not in more recent studies from France and China. Genetic polymorphism appears {{to be associated with}} inter-individual variability in metabolic response to HRT in postmenopausal women.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{situations}} when {{an inferior}} vena cava filter is considered advantageous, {{and those are}} if anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (e.g. shortly after a major operation), or a person has a pulmonary embolus in spite of being anticoagulated. In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage. In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary <b>emboli,</b> {{there is a lack}} of evidence supporting its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{a normal}} circulation, an embolus formed in a {{systemic}} vein will always {{impact in the}} lungs, after passing through {{the right side of}} the heart. This will form a pulmonary embolism that will result in a blockage of the main artery of the lung and can be a complication of deep-vein thrombosis. The most common sites of origin of pulmonary <b>emboli</b> are the femoral veins. The deep veins of the calf are the most common sites of actual thrombi.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of diving {{barotrauma}} {{depends on}} the symptoms. Lung over-pressure injury may require a chest drain to remove air from the pleura or mediastinum. Recompression with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for arterial gas embolism, as the raised pressure reduces bubble size, low inert gas partial pressure accelerates inert gas solution and high oxygen partial pressure helps oxygenate tissues compromised by the <b>emboli.</b> Care must be taken when recompressing to avoid a tension pneumothorax. Barotraumas that do not involve gas in the tissues are generally treated according to severity and symptoms for similar trauma from other causes.|$|E
25|$|The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI {{reported}} {{an increased risk}} of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and {{an increased risk of}} dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using 0.625mg of Premarin conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI {{reported an}} increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary <b>emboli</b> and DVT in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625mg of CEE with 2.5mg of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other <b>emboli</b> consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
25|$|As smaller {{pulmonary}} <b>emboli</b> tend {{to lodge}} in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation {{they are more}} likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and fainting, but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and BNP levels.|$|E
25|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes {{in the number of}} rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the positive predictive value of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it is very good at confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more <b>emboli</b> (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.|$|E

2500|$|Venous {{thrombus}} (clots in the veins) {{are quite}} common. [...] Embolizations (dislodgement of thrombi) normally {{go to the}} lung and cause pulmonary <b>emboli.</b> [...] In an individual with ASD, these <b>emboli</b> can potentially enter the arterial system, which can cause any phenomenon attributed to acute loss of blood to {{a portion of the}} body, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke), infarction of the spleen or intestines, or even a distal extremity (i.e., finger or toe).|$|E
