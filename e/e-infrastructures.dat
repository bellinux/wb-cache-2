The <b>e-Infrastructure</b> for e-Social Sciences project leverages Grid {{computing}} {{technology to}} provide an integrated platform which enables social science researchers to securely access a variety of e-Science resources. Security underpins the <b>e-Infrastructure</b> and a security framework with authentication and authorization functionality is a core component of the <b>e-Infrastructure</b> for social sciences. To build the security framework, we adopt Shibboleth as the basic authentication and authorization infrastructure and further combine PERMIS advanced authorization technology. As a result, this security framework integrates the advantages of both Shibboleth cross-domain identity federation and PERMIS policy driven role based authorization control, thus presenting a promising security model for secure access to the <b>e-Infrastructure</b> for the social sciences...|$|R

With the recent multiplication of efforts dedicated to <b>e-infrastructures,</b> scientific simulation can now benefit from the availability of massive computing and data storage facilities to sustain multi-disciplinary scientific challenges. As a side effect a variety of non-interoperable technologies coexist to enable the exploitation of computing infrastructures for in-silico experiments.

Consequently European research on simulation is currently hampered by several interoperability issues that reduce its efficiency by limiting knowledge and expertise sharing among scientific communities.

This report attempts to offer a flavour of e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> activity in each of the study countries and in particular evaluates the geographic, economic and cultural factors which shape the way that e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> are developing. It needs to be stressed that this study is not an attempt to objectively and exhaustively identify all aspects of e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> in each country. We have endeavored to highlight some interesting, innovative and important initiatives – but in so doing we offer no guarantees that major initiatives have not been over-looked. Any subjects with technology at their core are subject to the problem of being out-of-date almost before they can be reported. This is clearly true of e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> developments. Additionally the scope of this study – e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> across ten different countries – is considerable and without limitless time and resources, the best that can be achieved is a snapshot of each country. What is apparent is that while some countries share certain characteristics, such as population sizes and densities, systems of government and even language, in almost all cases there are factors unique to each which have shaped the way in which e-Learning and <b>e-Infrastructure</b> have evolved and will continue to influence their development in the future.  ...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on rarely occurring events that are best suited for urgent computations on existing HPC, Grid and Cloud <b>e-Infrastructures.</b> Since <b>e-Infrastructures</b> are meant to serve more than just one community of users, they have inherent characteristics {{that have to be}} modified or adapted in order to enable them effectively for urgent computing.

40|$|The {{current access}} {{policies}} and funding schemes of computing <b>e-infrastructures</b> represent a huge {{challenge for the}} sustainable growth of computing <b>e-infrastructures</b> and a serious jeopardy for investments made into these <b>e-infrastructures.</b> In {{order to be able}} to address these issues, the economics of computing <b>e-infrastructures</b> has to be understood thoroughly. As a first step in this direction, this paper conducts a set of computing e-infrastructure case studies and discusses the economic issues of different global computing e-infrastructure efforts. The analyses results show that the major shortcomings that need to be resolved are the insufficient involvement of the private sector in the development of computing <b>e-infrastructures,</b> the restricted user access to e-infrastructure resources, and the lack of sustainable funding. As a solution to these shortcomings, we propose a new funding and governing model for computing <b>e-infrastructures.</b> It follows a token-based market mechanism that allows a business-oriented operation of the computing e-infrastructure. We argue that this new model fosters the transition towards a sustainable computing e-infrastructure, being another requirement for successfully implementing the Cloud computing vision.
