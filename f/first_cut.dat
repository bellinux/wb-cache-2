5|$|For many years, the 85-minute {{version was}} the only one available, but despite this its {{reputation}} slowly grew. In 1956, boxes of original material were rediscovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival, with only a minor scene from Renoir's <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> missing. Since then, The Rules of the Game has often been called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Numerous film critics and directors have praised it highly, citing it as an inspiration for their own work.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the film}} was {{scheduled}} to shoot on five sound stages at Los Angeles: Downey, Sony, Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal. Filming moved to Chandler Field in Fresno, California, substituting for Mexico City International Airport, on October 11, 2007. After shooting aerial shots of Chandler Airport and a DC-3 {{on the morning of}} October 12, 2007, filming wrapped. Although he originally found no need for re-shoots after viewing his <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> of the film, Spielberg decided to add an establishing shot filmed on February 29, 2008, in Pasadena, California.|$|E
40|$|The method {{comprises}} producing multiple <b>first</b> <b>cuts</b> {{simultaneously in}} a workpiece along first cutting lines using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second cutting lines using multiple second separating tools. The <b>first</b> and second <b>cut</b> lines define a plane {{on which the}} cutting lines intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the <b>first</b> <b>cuts</b> is performed simultaneously with {{the production of the}} second cuts. The method comprises producing multiple <b>first</b> <b>cuts</b> simultaneously in a workpiece along first cutting lines using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second cutting lines using multiple second separating tools. The <b>first</b> and second <b>cut</b> lines define a plane on which the cutting lines intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the <b>first</b> <b>cuts</b> is performed simultaneously with the production of the second cuts. The steps of the producing the <b>cuts</b> along the <b>first</b> and second cutting lines are matched to one another such that each cut is separated by the <b>first</b> and second <b>cut</b> lines. The <b>first</b> and second cutting tools are arranged along a first axis and a second axis respectively, where the two axes are aligned parallel to each other during the production of the cuts and are formed by support elements. The support elements are moved relative to the production of the cuts to one another along the first and second axes to guide the separating tools along the <b>cut</b> lines. The <b>first</b> and/or second separating tools are energetic beams, which are directed on the workpiece via the support elements or a beam deflector. The support elements are partially guided to optical scanning devices along the <b>cut</b> lines. The <b>first</b> and second cutting tools are introduced in a cutting direction. An independent claim is included for a device for separating a workpiece into multiple segments...|$|R

5|$|Renoir {{edited the}} film while shooting; his <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite {{completed}} a 113-minute final {{cut of the}} film in July 1939. Jay hated it and demanded that Renoir make cuts, including the excision of Renoir's entire performance as Octave. Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 minutes from the film.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather {{conditions}} making shooting difficult enough to require {{an extra day}} of work. The episode's production took place just a week before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting {{in some of the}} scenes in the mountains being removed. Series creator Chris Carter re-edited the entire episode two days before it aired.|$|E

Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable {{to make her own}} video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed <b>first</b> <b>cut.</b> However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being rewarded with a kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother.

5|$|Fed by {{intelligence}} {{from the}} Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building {{up along the}} Pusan Perimeter {{and that they had}} to conduct an offensive soon or else forfeit the battle. In planning its new offensive, the North Korean commanders decided that any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy. Instead, they opted to use frontal attacks to breach the perimeter and collapse it. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city.

5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture is a {{scavenger}} and subsists {{entirely on}} carrion. It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> into the carcass {{of a larger}} animal as its beak is {{not strong enough to}} tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the greater yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they {{play an important role in}} the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} <b>first</b> <b>cut.</b> Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Operation Swath-10 (also {{known as}} Bilogora '91) was planned by the Croatians {{to regain control}} of the Virovitica–Lončarica–Grubišno Polje road, cutting off and {{destroying}} the TO forces deployed {{in the area of the}} road (the northernmost part of western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA). Those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica; control the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia; shorten the Croatian defensive positions, and improve troop and civilian morale. The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October, but was postponed for two weeks due to the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police. The plan of operation called for the ZNG to <b>first</b> <b>cut</b> off the two TO battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within 48 hours, with the second stage of the offensive destroying the trapped TO force. The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav Jezerčić, commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone, on 7 October.|$|E
