5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should <b>have,</b> <b>because</b> as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should <b>have</b> <b>because</b> of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E

It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that [...] "The Joker {{is such a great}} character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom.

Liz and Wesley also attend a second run of the movie Hot Tub Time Machine, which provokes arguments between them despite their mutual enjoyment of the film.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula.

CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could <b>have</b> <b>because</b> it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{deal was}} signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed {{all of the}} {{commercial}} rights to Formula One to him for 15years, {{on the condition that}} they would return to the FIA {{at the end of that}} period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could <b>have</b> <b>because</b> it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA’s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and [...] van Miert".|$|E

2500|$|Race {{and race}} {{relations}} are prominent {{areas of study}} in sociology and economics. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism.

Du Bois wrote, [...] "The problem {{of the twentieth century}} is the problem of the color line." [...] Wellman (1993) defines racism as [...] "culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites <b>have</b> <b>because</b> of the subordinated position of racial minorities". In both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the inequality in income, wealth, net worth, and access to other cultural resources, such as education, between racial groups.|$|E

In a retrospective interview, Farrands noted that the finale in this {{cut of the}} film was sufficiently [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "Gothic," [...] but conceded that it lacked intensity, which is largely what prompted Dimension Films to begin reshoots. The Producer's Cut of the film garnered a cult following, according to writer Farrands: [...] "It's amazing the life that [...] has continued to <b>have</b> <b>because</b> there is this alternate version that has been, kind of in-the-vault all these years." ...|$|E

Research published by Moody's in May 2014 said that an independent Scotland would be given an A rating, comparable with Poland, the Czech Republic and Mexico. An A rating would be two grades below its current rating for the UK, which Moody's said would be unaffected by Scottish independence.|$|E
