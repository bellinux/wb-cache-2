The liquefied CO 2 (LCO 2) to be sequestered is directly injected into subseabed geological formations through a <b>flexible</b> <b>riser</b> pipe using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO 2 carrier ship. The <b>flexible</b> <b>riser</b> pipe remains on the seabed, one end attached to the injection wellhead, until the other end is hoisted up and connected to the (dynamic positioning system (DPS) -controlled) LCO 2 carrier ship arriving at the ocean injection site.

40|$|Flexible pipe is a layered {{structure}} composed of plastic and steel materials. Under a large bending moment, the pipe layers may slide relative to each other due to internal friction. The moment curvature relationship for the flexible pipe is a tri-linear curve. Under cyclic bending moment, a hysteresis loop will be formed in the moment curvature curve. The area of the loop is the energy loss due to the internal friction. This thesis is aimed to {{study the effects of}} hysteresis damping on the global analysis of the <b>flexible</b> <b>riser.</b> To begin with, a review on the flexible pipe technology and nonlinear finite element method is performed. Then a local analysis is carried out in BFLEX to obtain the cross sectional characteristics. Then the global analysis is conducted to study the responses of the <b>flexible</b> <b>riser</b> in terms of the curvature, moment and axial force. From the study, slip behavior only occurs at the hang off part of the riser. For the rest part, pipe layers stay in the stick regime, meaning there is no energy loss due to the internal friction. Therefore for the global analysis of the <b>flexible</b> <b>riser,</b> {{there is no need to}} further study the equivalent linear damping models. In addition, the influence of linear and nonlinear bending models on the global response of the riser is investigated.

50|$|The {{rigid pipe}} of the SCR forms a {{catenary}} between its hang-off {{point on the}} floating or rigid platform, and the seabed. A free-hanging SCR assumes a shape roughly similar to the letter 'J'. A catenary of a lazy wave SCR consists in fact {{of at least three}} catenary segments. The top and the seabed segments of the catenary have negative submerged weight, and their curvatures 'bulge' towards the seabed. The middle segment has buoyant material attached along its entire length, so that the ensemble of the steel pipe and the buoyancy is positively buoyant. Accordingly, the curvature of the buoyant segment 'bulges' upwards (inverted catenary), and its shape can also be well approximated with the same ideal catenary equations. The positively and negatively buoyant segments are tangent to each other at the points where they join. The overall catenary shape of the SCR has at those locations points of inflection. Lazy Wave SCRs were first installed on a turret moored FPSO offshore Brazil (BC-10, Shell) in 2009, even though Lazy Wave configuration <b>flexible</b> <b>risers</b> had been in a wide use for several decades beforehand.|$|E

40|$|Pipes for gas {{production}} and transport with a corrugated inner surface, {{as used in}} flexible pipes, can be subject to Flow-Induced Pulsations when the flow velocity is larger than a certain velocity. This onset velocity {{is dependent on the}} geometry of the corrugations, the operational conditions and the geometry of the topside and subsea piping. In this paper, small-scale tests performed on corrugated tubes are reported. The tested geometries include both "classical" profiles, similar to the inner profile of agraff <b>flexible</b> <b>risers,</b> and profiles with less typical variations, such as narrower and/or deeper cavities, or irregular pitch. These tests were performed in order to evaluate the validity of a prediction model developed earlier for the onset of pulsations, for corrugated pipes with these kinds of atypical variations, which are found on a new type of carcass designs. The mechanism of Flow-Induced Pulsations in corrugated pipes is discussed, as well as the principle of the prediction model. The experimental results show that the validity of the model remains reasonable in most cases, except when the cavities are very narrow. In this case, the model becomes overly conservative. This limitation {{can be attributed to the}} fact that, for very narrow cavities, the cavity opening becomes too small compared to the boundarylayer momentum thickness, effectively destroying any instability of the shear layer. Furthermore, the shift towards higher frequencies of the acoustic source term due to narrower cavities, and the possible coupling with higher acoustic modes, is considered. The results of the analysis are used to evaluate the onset velocity and whistling behavior of a newly developed carcass design of <b>flexible</b> <b>risers.</b> A previous analysis has indicated that the particular geometry profile of the new design improves the whistling behavior by pushing the onset velocity outside the typical operational envelope of <b>flexible</b> <b>risers.</b> The analysis confirms that the new design will be less prone to whistling than <b>flexible</b> <b>risers</b> with classical agraff carcasses.
