We {{would also like}} to thank the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for providing us with some of the data used in this study. Finally, we acknowledge financial support by the National Science Foundation grant SBR- 0617844. We develop a model for the market of public housing that captures excess demand for public <b>housing</b> and <b>rationing</b> in equilibrium. We characterize the equilibrium and show that a unique equilibrium exists if the housing authority follows an equal treatment policy and does not discriminate based on current residence. We then develop a maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of the model. The estimator accounts for enriched sampling and imposes all equilibrium conditions in estimation. We estimate the parameters of the model based on a unique restricted use panel data set of low-income households in Pitts-burgh. We find that for each household that leaves public housing there are on average 14 households that would like to move into the vacated unit. Demolitions of existing units increase the degree of rationing and are likely to result in welfare losses...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} Scottish households' tenure choice behaviour {{by using}} economic approaches. The data set {{comes from the}} 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS). To estimate the household's tenure decision behaviour, two simulation models with different structures are developed. The first tenure choice model contains a simple one-level choice set. A multinomial logit model is employed to estimate three choice alternatives: owner-occupation, social renting and private renting. The second tenure choice model contains a two-level choice structure assuming that the household firstly decides to move or stay and then chooses a tenure alternative. A nested multinomial logit model is employed to estimate the decision to move/stay and the choice of three tenure alternative. The determinants of the two tenure choice models not only include household attributes but also include housing attributes. The household attributes generally consist of the household's demographic and socio-economic variables, while housing attributes include dwelling type, location and neighbourhood variables. In addition, this thesis also includes the <b>housing</b> subsidy and <b>rationing</b> variables to estimates their impacts on tenure choice. The estimation {{results show that the}} household long term income, the user cost of housing, <b>housing</b> subsidy and <b>rationing</b> variables, as expected, have the most significant influences on households' tenure decisions in Scotland. Moreover, three policy issues are derived from the results of the tenure choice models. The first issue discusses the simulation of the influences of changes in the income tax rate and the mortgage rationing ratios on tenure choice. The second issue analyses income inequality and tenure polarisation. The third issue examines the distribution of housing subsidy between tenures and income levels...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 1995 among 135 commercial farmers in KwaZulu-Natal to analyse labour remuneration and farmers' perceptions {{about the impact of}} labour legislation recently extended to agriculture. Farm labour remuneration normally includes cash wages and payments in kind (such as <b>rations,</b> <b>housing,</b> land use rights and clothing). The study suggests that, all things being equal, farmers who pay relatively lower cash wages tend to provide more rations per worker and allocate more land use rights. Most respondents agreed that there is some need for labour legislation in agriculture, but the majority perceived the present legislation to be time-consuming and costly, and wanted the legislation to be less ambiguous, more flexible and less extensive. Labour legislation has increased transaction and wage costs in farming and could lead to the substitution of own machinery, contract machinery or contract labour for own labour. Survey respondents indicated that, if minimum wages were imposed, cash wages would be paid and perquisites would be charged for. If the minimum wage was set above present wages, labour would be replaced with machinery and contractors. Respondents would prefer an industrial council to determine minimum wages (if they are imposed), accounting for enterprise and regional differences. Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{breeding}} performance of broiler breeder chickens previously raised on {{high levels of}} monensin was evaluated. The birds were raised on concrete floors in an open-sided pullet brooding and growing house. At 21 weeks of age monensin feeding was stopped and birds {{were placed in the}} breeder <b>house.</b> A breeder <b>ration</b> formulated to contain 2, 920 kcal metabolizable energy and 16 % crude protein was fed to all the birds irrespective of the growing system used. A standard feeding allowance and lighting program as recommended by Indian River International was followed during the laying period. The parameters determined were body weight uniformity at 21 weeks of age, egg production, egg weight, shell weight, shell thickness, feed conversion (kilograms feed/dozen eggs), mortality, fertility, and hatchability. Assays for monensin residue in the breast muscle, liver, and abdominal fat were run at 52 weeks of age (31 weeks after monensin withdrawal). Birds grown on high levels of monensin were not as uniform in body weight at 21 weeks of age as the restricted controls. Only birds fed 400 ppm of monensin with a low protein diet during the growing period showed a significant reduction in egg production, shell weight, and shell thickness. There were no significant differences among the growing systems in mortality during lay, fertility, hatch of fertile eggs, and hatch of total eggs. Monensin was not detectable (<. l ppm) in the liver, abdominal fat, and breast muscle. It was concluded that monensin can be used as an appetite suppressant for growing broiler breeders at levels of 300 to 400 ppm during the growing period with no adverse effects on subsequent {{breeding performance}} and salvage value of the breeder birds {{at the end of the}} breeding period.

5000|$|Robinson befriended Truganini, {{learned some}} of the local {{language}} and in 1833 managed to persuade the remaining 154 [...] "full-blooded" [...] people to move to the new settlement on Flinders Island, where he promised a modern and comfortable environment, and that they would be returned to their former homes on the Tasmanian mainland as soon as possible. At the Wybalenna Aboriginal establishment on Flinders Island, described by historian Henry Reynolds as the [...] "best equipped and most lavishly staffed Aboriginal institution in the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century", they were provided with <b>housing,</b> clothing, <b>rations</b> of food, the services of a doctor and educational facilities. Convicts were assigned to build housing and do most of the work at the settlement including the growing of food in the vegetable gardens. After arrival, all Aboriginal children aged between six and 15 years were removed from their families to be brought up by the storekeeper and a lay preacher. The Aboriginal people were free to roam the island and were often absent from the settlement for extended periods on hunting trips as the rations supplied turned out to be inadequate. By 1835 the living conditions had deteriorated to the extent that in October Robinson personally took charge of Wybalenna, organising better food and improving the housing. However, of the 220 who arrived with Robinson, most died in the following 14 years from introduced disease and inadequate shelter. As a result of their loss of freedom, the birth rate was extremely low and few children survived infancy.In 1839, Governor Franklin appointed a board to inquire into the conditions at Wybalenna that rejected Robinson's claims regarding improved living conditions and found the settlement to be a failure. The report was never released and the government continued to promote Wybalenna as a success in the treatment of Aboriginal people.In March 1847 six Aboriginals at Wybalenna presented a petition to Queen Victoria, the first petition to a reigning monarch from any Aboriginal group in Australia, requesting that the promises made to them be honoured.In October 1847, the 47 survivors were transferred to their final settlement at Oyster Cove station. Only 44 survived the trip (11 couples, 12 single men and 10 children) and the children were immediately sent to the orphan school in Hobart. Although the housing and food was better than Wybalenna, the station was a former convict station that had been abandoned earlier that year due to health issues as it was located on inadequately drained mudflats. According to the guards, the Aboriginal people developed [...] "too much independence" [...] by trying to continue their culture which they considered [...] "recklessness" [...] and [...] "rank ingratitude." [...] Their numbers continued to diminish, being estimated in 1859 at around a dozen and, by 1869, there was only one, who died in 1876.|$|R
50|$|As {{time went}} on, {{disputes}} would occur between the First Nations members and Canadian officials over {{the terms of}} the treaty. During the fall of 1881, government employees from I. G. Baker Company, who were in charge of supplying the Blackfoot with food, began reducing rations. On two occasions, they ran out of flour and beef, causing starvation. Even when supplies were adequate, they barely satisfied the people’s hunger, leading to discontent and complaints. As fall began to change to winter, these feelings grew to anger and discontent. Feeling the plight of his people, Crowfoot led two delegations to the farm instructor to plead for more generous rations. Their pleas were not taken seriously, so they resorted to intimidation, threatening the government employees and firing a gun {{in the direction of the}} <b>rations</b> <b>house.</b> On another occasion in January 1882, Crowfoot intervened to defend a secondary chief named Bull Elk who was being wrongly arrested for stealing a steer head from I.G. Baker that he had actually paid for. At this point, Crowfoot denounced the government employees for their mistreatment of the Blackfoot people. He declared that he would turn Bull Elk over when he would receive a fair trial. The I.G. Baker employees had no choice but to agree. Although, Bull Elk was arbitrarily arrested a second time, enraging the Blackfoot warriors. Crowfoot was also furious, and led these men to confront Superintendent Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier, the commanding RCMP officer for this area. Crowfoot resisted his temptations to unleash his men on the outnumbered Canadians. He knew that vengeance would only being a temporary satisfaction that would soon turn to despair as the Canadians would return in greater numbers looking to spill blood, just as they done to the Métis under Louis Riel. He sent the men home, and Bull Elk was tried and found innocent of the accusation of theft.|$|R
40|$|Reporting Wartime Germany" is a {{study of}} the memoirs, diaries, and other works of American journalists who were in Berlin during the early wartime years, 1939 - 1941. It {{analyzes}} their perceptions of the changes which occurred during that important period. Manipulation of politics and political power is discussed, along with growth of resistance to the regime, and the apparent inability of the regime to negotiate with foreigners in good faith. The role of newspapers, periodicals, radio and the motion picture industry as media of propaganda is studied; the system of education, control of religion, and attempts to regulate artistic endeavors are surveyed. Particular attention is paid to the use of literature and art as means of directing the minds of the Berliners. Various forms of culture, including opera and the theater, are analyzed in terms of their importance as a"-form of escape for the Berliners. Other types of entertainment, such as nightclubs, restaurants, and vaudeville, along with spectator sports, are also included. Analysis is offered concerning the immediate loss of such "luxuries" as adequate transportation, liquor, coffee and tea, and cigarettes, the shortage of <b>housing</b> and the <b>rationing</b> of such staples as food and clothing, and the impact these changes in lifestyle had on the Berliners. The gradual change in attitude perceived by the Americans, from acceptance of conditions to fear that the war might be lost, is described. Because of the need to verify the often highly subjective reports of the journalists, there are extensive notes which include references to accounts by others who were in Berlin, either contemporaneously or earlier or later than the first wartime years, and also to significant secondary works. Thus this study presents a broad overview of Berlin during the early wartime years, as seen by foreigners with many different perspectives. The similarities and differences in their perceptions are noted. The discrepancies are stressed, with verifying sources for different viewpoints included in the notes. The conclusion drawn is that the real changes perceived by the Americans occurred in 1933, when the Nazis came to power, and after the summer of 1941 following the beginning of the Russian campaign. More importantly, the study underlines the importance of using and carefully comparing multiple sources for any type of historical inquiry. The study underscores how well-meaning and supposedly objective observers of the same scene can often differ significantly in their perceptions, interpretation, and reporting of specificevents and major trends.
