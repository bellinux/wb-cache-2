5|$|By the 1890s <b>food</b> <b>was</b> {{still very}} limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, {{and the general}} {{standard}} of the prison's <b>food</b> <b>was</b> quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of <b>food</b> <b>was</b> set aside for this action and the <b>food</b> <b>was</b> worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E

50|$|The term health <b>food</b> has <b>been</b> {{used since}} the 1920s {{to refer to}} {{specific}} <b>foods</b> claimed to <b>be</b> especially beneficial to health, although the term has no official definition. Some terms {{that are associated with}} health <b>food</b> <b>are</b> macrobiotics, natural <b>foods,</b> organic foods and whole <b>foods.</b> Macrobiotics <b>is</b> a diet focusing primarily on whole cereals. Whole cereals, along with other whole <b>foods,</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> minimally processed. Whole cereals have their fiber, germ and hull intact and are considered more nutritious. Natural <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> simply <b>foods</b> that contain no artificial ingredients. Organic <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> grown without the use of conventional and artificial pesticides and must meet certain organic standards.|$|R

5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until <b>food</b> <b>was</b> added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After <b>food</b> <b>was</b> introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E

5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional <b>food</b> <b>was</b> available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E

5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where <b>food</b> <b>was</b> relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where <b>food</b> <b>was</b> plentiful.|$|E
5|$|The middle–late Campanian {{formations}} show {{a greater}} diversity of dinosaurs {{than any other}} single group of rocks.

5|$|Triceratops were herbivorous, {{and because}} of their low head, their primary <b>food</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} low growth, although {{they may have been}} able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk.

50|$|Regenerists {{call for}} the {{creation}} of demand on agricultural systems to produce regenerative <b>foods.</b> This <b>is</b> often compared {{to the creation of the}} demand for organic food.
