5|$|The TARDIS materialises on a {{seemingly}} derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore {{the ship and}} are puzzled to find an eighteenth-century French fireplace. When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a time window, who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E

25|$|The $500 million ten-year {{contract}} between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and BP (formerly BP Amoco), {{one of the}} world's largest energy production companies, officially went into effect Wednesday November 14, 2007 following approval {{by a majority of}} the faculty. The grant is the largest in the University's history. The deal has garnered criticism from some students and faculty who claim the agreement was negotiated in secret, and that <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> Berkeley's reputation as an autonomous and democratic institution of higher learning. Supporters of the deal, on the other hand, assert that the infusion of capital from the venture will benefit the campus as a whole at a time when public universities are dealing with increasing cuts in State and Federal funding. They also point out that the BP deal focuses on developing alternative energy, an important issue in today's world.|$|E
500|$|Bacon and Morgan {{described}} his bassline for the Beatles song [...] "Rain" [...] as [...] "an astonishing piece of playing... {{thinking in terms}} of both rhythm and 'lead bass'... the area of the neck... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove." [...] MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best B-side, stating that its [...] "clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [...] ", which MacDonald described as [...] "so inventive that <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to overwhelm the track". MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in [...] "exotic melismas in the bass part". McCartney identified Sgt.

500|$|Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine {{called it}} a [...] "perfectly {{acceptable}} album filler: innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to become a gospelized stomp." [...] However, Mac noted that [...] "t wouldn't be particularly lamentable {{were it not for}} the fact that there are so many better choices for the standard edition of the album that have been relegated to bonus tracks." [...] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times {{called it a}} [...] "dull ballad", while for Saeed Saeed of The National the song [...] "is the first of a few tracks that should have been cut," [...] criticizing its [...] "atmospheric keyboards" [...] for being [...] "sleep-inducing." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters named it one of the album's [...] "forgettable jams" [...] and a [...] "generic thump," [...] meanwhile Lydia Jenkins of The New Zealand Herald opined that [...] "Hold Tight" [...] has [...] "so little substance [...] it seems wrong to call it a song." ...|$|E
500|$|His 1994 film I'll Do Anything, {{starring}} Nick Nolte, {{was conceived}} and filmed by Brooks as an old-fashioned movie musical and parody of [...] "Hollywood lifestyles and movie clichés", costing $40 million. It featured songs by Carole King, Prince, and Sinéad O'Connor, among others, with choreography by Twyla Tharp. When preview audience {{reactions to the}} music were overwhelmingly negative, all production numbers from the film were cut and Brooks wrote several new scenes, filming them over three days and spending seven weeks editing the film down to two hours. Brooks noted: [...] "Something like this not only tries one's soul – <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> one's soul." [...] While {{it was not unusual}} for Brooks to edit his films substantially after preview screenings on this occasion he was [...] "denied any privacy" [...] because the media reported the negative reviews before its release and [...] "it had to be good enough to counter all this bad publicity." [...] It was a commercial failure, and Brooks attempted to produce a documentary about it four years later but was scuppered by failing to obtain the rights to Prince's song.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} episode {{included}} great lines, strong personality-driven comedy and good character moments, specially Tom's emotional {{reaction to his}} painting. Pierce said the Andy and Ron subplot was [...] "so well played that <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to usurp the mural storyline". Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the [...] "murinal" [...] jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that [...] "Child labor laws are ruining this country." [...] Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said make jokes connected in [...] "The Camel", including the Andy shoeshine plot and the [...] "unexpectedly glamorous" [...] sewage department. But he particularly praised the character development in the main plot, in which [...] "each {{in their own way}} sticks to the purity of their uniquely screwy ideas". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student praised the entire cast, particularly Offerman and Pratt, who he said provide the show's two best characters. Sanders said the fact that the episode included a [...] "hilarious subplot" [...] involving both of them [...] "was more evidence that the writers have been listening to the fans".|$|E

500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the show that was widely {{discussed}} among commentators was the moral dilemma presented in the episode between a pragmatic approach to ruling or remaining true to the ideals of justice and honor, exemplified in the scene where Eddard summons Tywin Lannister to the court to answer for the crimes of his bannerman Gregor Clegane. Poniewozik states that Eddard [...] "doesn't seem to consider that he has options: he is left to rule in the king's place, an injustice has been committed, the law requires one path to justice and he chooses it. This makes his decision easy, but it may make his life, and others', difficult." [...] According to The Atlantics Scott Meslow, [...] "Ned's principles are, as always, admirable, and he's clearly interested in justice. But the sad {{truth is that the}} lack of guile that makes him honorable also makes him a pretty poor king. It's a terrible idea to order the arrest of the man who is single-handedly financing your kingdom." [...] Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, agreed with Meslow and concluded that [...] "the only thing more dangerous than a reckless man asserting their [...] power in Westeros is an honorable man doing the same, as <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> the delicate framework which has propped up King Robert for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The Human Centipede {{contains}} {{relatively few}} gory images; {{little of the}} surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is [...] "never quite as outrageous as <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to be." [...] Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being [...] "100% medically accurate." [...] Six said that the surgeon initially {{wanted nothing to do}} with his film, as he felt Six was [...] "crazy" [...] and the idea had [...] "nothing to do with medical science." [...] However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he in fact liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. The special effects team was led by a father and son team, Rob Hillenbrink and son Erik. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear for the actor behind on which to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of [...] "suit" [...] the actors would be wearing.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album was, overall, fairly laudatory. Its score of 79 out of 100 – or 'generally favorable' – on Metacritic attests to decent reception. Regarding its place in Isis' catalog, it {{has been described as}} their [...] "most accomplished and complete album to date" [...] by Ali Maloney of The Skinny, as their [...] "smartest and richest record" [...] and as [...] "the toughest and catchiest Isis record" [...] since their debut full-length, Celestial." [...] Beyond the band's own repertoire, it was described as [...] "metal played at its arresting best", and Andrew Rennie of NOW went as far as declaring it [...] "close to perfect". Not all reviews were so glowing, as the NME characterized it as [...] "45 minutes of awesomeness stretched out to a slightly bloated hour [...] the unsettling Toolisms of 'Ghost Key' meander just too long and 'Hand of the Host' spends half of its 11 minutes repeating itself without really juddering into the granite riff golem <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to be." [...] Similarly, Chris Norton of Tiny Mix Tapes feels that the album [...] "isn't the band's best by a really long shot, even if it ain't bad." [...] Accessibility was a similarly divisive issue, with the album being characterized as [...] "perhaps their most rewarding yet, but simultaneously their hardest to immediately access given its prioritising of subtle nuances over senses-numbing assaults" [...] and [...] "a slow-burning success". Conversely, it has also been declared to be [...] "easily the band's most accessible effort". Allmusic's William Ruhlmann felt that with regards to structure, [...] "Wavering Radiant works as a single piece of music rather than a series of songs", as Milton Savage of Drowned in Sound concurred that Isis have [...] "construct their latest so that it's best experienced as a whole".|$|E

500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like everybody in this party is shining like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when <b>it</b> <b>threatens</b> to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings about the media scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, I lose a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E
