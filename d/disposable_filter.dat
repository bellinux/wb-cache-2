5000|$|Due to the {{patented}} {{technical features}} that allowed effective cleaning {{of all kinds}} of carpets and bare floors, plus the ability to clean in the tightest corners, the 350, which indicated that the brush vibrator bar was 35 cm, was sold and used in hotels, hospitals and offices. With the addition of features like a clutch-protected brush roller, a by-pass motor and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s. In 1986, the SEBO 360 was launched to replace the 350. The 360 had a simple, electronic surface height adjustment feature that would automatically raise or lower the suction nozzle based on different cleaning surfaces. It would also notify if there was a brush obstruction or if the <b>disposable</b> <b>filter</b> bag was full.|$|E
5000|$|The 350 {{was their}} first upright vacuum cleaner and it was {{engineered}} for commercial uses.

If the machine was [...] "complicated" [...] for the employee to use, then the machine isn't any good. They still had to vacuum, but didn't care that the machine needed the <b>disposable</b> <b>filter</b> bag to be changed, readjusted for different floor surfaces, or that there was a clog somewhere. With that in mind, it offered a degree of functionality that didn't require the user to read an operations manual before using. It was equipped with a commercial-grade motor that could run continuously for 1000 hours or 41 days. The 350 was designed to pass the hardest test; to survive the abuse and neglect of cleaning professionals.|$|E
50|$|Traditional light {{scattering}} instruments worked by taking readings from multiple angles, each being measured in series. A low angle {{light scattering}} system {{was developed in}} the early 1970s that allowed a single measurement to be used to calculate the molar mass. Although measurements at low angles are better for fundamental physical reasons (molecules tend to scatter more light in lower angle directions than in higher angles), low angle scattering events caused by dust and contamination of the mobile phase easily overwhelm the scattering from the molecules of interest. When the low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) became popular in the 1970s and mid-1980s, good quality <b>disposable</b> <b>filters</b> were not readily available and hence multi-angle measurements gained favour.|$|R

When these filter holders were transported to a remote laboratory, the sample preparation cassette will be used in the on-site extraction of the DNA/RNA from the cells on the membrane.

The scrubber was found to average greater than 95 percent dust removal efficiency with <b>disposable</b> <b>filters,</b> and 88 and 90 percent, respectively, with optional washable filters in their prewash and post-wash test conditions. Although the washable filters can be reused, washing them generated personal and downstream respirable dust concentrations of 1. 2 and 8. 3 mg/m(3), respectively, for a 10 -min washing period. The scrubber's velocity-pressure-regulated variable-frequency-drive fan maintained relatively consistent airflow near the targeted 1. 42 and 4. 25 m(3) /s (3, 000 and 9, 000 ft(3) /min) airflow rates {{during most of the}} laboratory dust testing until reaching its maximum 60 -Hz fan motor frequency or horsepower rating at 2, 610 Pa (10. 5 in. w. g.) of filter differential pressure and 3. 97 m(3) /s (8, 420 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow quantity. Laboratory sound level measurements of the scrubber showed that the outlet side of the scrubber was noisier, and the loaded filters increased sound levels compared with clean filters at the same airflow quantities. With loaded filters, the scrubber reached a 90 dB(A) sound level at 2. 83 m(3) /s (6, 000 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow, indicating that miners should not be overexposed in relation to MSHA's permissible exposure level - under Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations Part 62. 101 - of 90 dB(A) at or below this airflow quantity. The scrubber's washable filters were not used during field-testing because of their lower respirable dust removal efficiency and the airborne dust generated by filter washing.

40|$|Three {{types of}} uncatalyzed diesel {{particulate}} filter (DPF) systems, three types of high-temperature <b>disposable</b> <b>filter</b> elements (DFEs), and one diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) were evaluated in underground mine conditions for their effects on the concentrations and size distributions of diesel aerosols. Those effects were compared {{with the effects of}} a standard muffler. The experimental work was conducted directly in an underground environment using a unique diesel laboratory developed in an underground experimental mine. The DPF systems reduced total mass of aerosols in the mine air approximately 10 -fold for light-load and 20 -fold or more for high-load test conditions. The DFEs offered similar reductions in aerosol mass concentrations. The efficiency of the new DFEs significantly increased with accumulation of operating time and buildup of diesel particulate matter in the porous structure of the filter elements. A single laundering process did not exhibit substantial effects on performance of the filter element. The effectiveness of DPFs and DFEs in removing aerosols by number was strongly influenced by engine operating mode. The concentrations of nucleation mode aerosols in the mine air were found to be substantially higher for both DPFs and DFEs when the engine was operated at high-load modes than at low-load modes.

Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked exhaust flame traps (scrubber tanks), incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in raw exhaust elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways.
