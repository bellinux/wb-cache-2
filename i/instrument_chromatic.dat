5000|$|String players play {{two major}} scales, and a melodic minor three octaves in range. They {{also play a}} {{prepared}} piece, and a sight-reading piece. Wind and mallet percussion players play two major scales for {{the full range of}} their <b>instrument,</b> <b>chromatic</b> scale for the full range of their instrument as well as two prepared pieces, one etude and an orchestral excerpts, and a sight-reading piece. Percussion players play rudiments and rolls on the snare drum, as well as on other instruments including the timpani and auxiliary percussion.|$|E
50|$|Some pitch pipes are {{intended}} for tuning string instruments, and only provide reeds for notes appropriate to a particular <b>instrument.</b> <b>Chromatic</b> pitch pipes are favored by a cappella singers and timpanists. Chromatic pipes most often provide thirteen pitches, each a half step above the previous. By providing all of the notes of a single octave, a singer can start in any key called for in Western music. Different pipes are available for bass and treble voices due to the differences in vocal range: male singers most often use F-F pipes, while female singers favor C-C pipes. However, it is particularly notable that the Men's pipe in F is pitched higher than the Women's C pipe. Pipes in other keys are available, but are much more rare.|$|E
5000|$|Rizzetta is {{particularly}} noted {{for a number}} of innovations in hammered dulcimer design. These include bridge markers (a standard feature of modern <b>instruments),</b> <b>chromatic</b> designs, extra bridges, damper pedals, and many more. Rizzetta has collaborated closely with the Dusty Strings Company of Seattle, Washington; they have produced a [...] "Rizzetta series" [...] of chromatic models for many years.|$|R
5000|$|Because it is a fully <b>chromatic</b> <b>instrument,</b> the <b>chromatic</b> {{harmonica}} is {{the instrument}} of choice in jazz and classical music. The [...] "solo tuning" [...] layout repeats itself at each octave, which simplifies playing in different octaves and keys {{in contrast to the}} Richter tuning system. Also, due to the windsavers on the low and mid-range holes, it can bend notes on both blow and draw notes, giving additional tonality if needed. In traditional harmonica bands, the chromatic harmonica plays the lead part.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the impetus}} for a tubular valve began as early as 1793, {{it was not until}} 1818 that Friedrich Bluhmel and Heinrich Stölzel made a joint patent {{application}} for the box valve as manufactured by W. Schuster. The symphonies of Mozart, Beethoven, and as late as Brahms, were still played on natural trumpets. Crooks and shanks (removable tubing of various lengths) as opposed to keys or valves were standard, notably in France, into {{the first part of the}} 20th century. As a consequence of this late development of the <b>instrument's</b> <b>chromatic</b> ability, the repertoire for the instrument is relatively small compared to other instruments. The 20th century saw an explosion in the amount and variety of music written for the trumpet.|$|R
2500|$|Currently, Canadian bandura-maker Bill Vetzal {{has focused}} on making these {{instruments}} with some success. His latest <b>instruments</b> are fully <b>chromatic,</b> with re-tuning mechanism, and the backs are made of fibreglass. [...] Additionally, Andrij (Andy) Birko, an American bandura maker, is also making Kharkiv instruments, applying construction and acoustic principles from guitars (both flat-top and arch-top) {{in an attempt to}} provide a more balanced and even tone to the instrument. Currently, he produces <b>chromatic</b> <b>instruments</b> but without re-tuning mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Modern mallet {{percussion}} instruments {{exist at}} many levels, from toy glockenspiels {{such as the}} Pixiphone popularly (and incorrectly) known as xylophones, to orchestral instruments, and including many folk instruments. Many of these are diatonic, while professional mallet percussion <b>instruments</b> are <b>chromatic</b> keyboard percussion <b>instruments,</b> set out in a fashion similar to a piano keyboard.|$|R

50|$|These {{instruments}} {{were used by}} ensembles in Chernihiv Province and also widely in Western Ukraine. These <b>instruments</b> allow <b>chromatic</b> notes to be readily obtained, a semitone lower than the primary sound of the pipe. This is done by bending {{the angle of the}} pipes with relation to the player's lips. The air stream is thus broken on {{the far end of the}} pipe, rather than the end closest the lips.|$|R
5000|$|The pedal or concert harp is a technologically {{advanced}} instrument, particularly distinguished by {{its use of}} [...] "pedals", foot-controlled devices which can alter the pitch of given strings, making the <b>instrument</b> fully <b>chromatic</b> and thus able to play a wide body of classical repertoire. Pedals were first introduced in 1697 by Jakob Hochbrucker of Bavaria. In 1811 these were upgraded to the [...] "double action" [...] pedal system patented by Sébastien Erard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{xylophone}} (from the Greek words —xylon, [...] "wood" [...] + —phōnē, [...] "sound, voice", meaning [...] "wooden sound") is {{a musical}} instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic {{in the case of}} many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's <b>instruments,</b> or <b>chromatic</b> for orchestral use.|$|R
50|$|Hampel {{was born}} in Prague, but worked in Dresden, Germany, with {{instrument}} maker Johann Werner, collaborating {{on the design of}} the so-called Inventionshorn, which used sliding medial crooks inside the hoop in an attempt to achieve a fully <b>chromatic</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{contrabass}} bugle is {{the only}} member of the drum corps bugle line that has never been produced in a valve-less style, as it was developed when the drum corps rules allowed one piston valve and one rotary valve. They changed to fit new rules along with the rest of the drum corps hornline, first receiving two vertical (or in this case, slanted for ease of use) piston valves, then 3 and later 4 valves to make the <b>instrument</b> fully <b>chromatic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of valves, however, {{opened up}} {{a great deal more}} {{flexibility}} in playing in different keys; in effect, the horn became an entirely different <b>instrument,</b> fully <b>chromatic</b> for the first time. Valves were originally used primarily as a means to play in different keys without crooks, not for harmonic playing. That is reflected in compositions for horns, which only began to include chromatic passages in the late 19th century. When valves were invented, generally, the French made narrower-bored horns with piston valves and the Germans made larger-bored horns with rotary valves.|$|R
50|$|The term {{xylophone}} {{may be used}} generally, {{to include}} all such instruments such as the marimba, balafon and even the semantron. However, in the orchestra, the term xylophone refers specifically to a <b>chromatic</b> <b>instrument</b> of somewhat higher pitch range and drier timbre than the marimba, and these two instruments should not be confused.|$|R
5000|$|Rick Estrin, from Rick Estrin & the Nightcats, {{referred}} to Guyger in the liner notes {{of one of}} the latter's albums as [...] "a true master of the blues harmonica." [...] Guyger has played with Rogers, Charlie Musselwhite, Little Sammy Davis and Mark Hummel, and is proficient in both diatonic and <b>chromatic</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern {{trumpets}} {{have three}} (or infrequently four) piston valves, {{each of which}} increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (2 semitones), the second valve by a half step (1 semitone), and the third valve by one-and-a-half steps (3 semitones). When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the <b>instrument</b> fully <b>chromatic,</b> i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of classical music. For {{more information about the}} different types of valves, see Brass instrument valves.|$|R
50|$|Changes by August Bohlin (1877-1949) in 1929/1930 {{made the}} nyckelharpa a <b>chromatic</b> <b>instrument</b> with a {{straight}} bow, making it a more violin-like and no longer a bourdon instrument. Composer, player and maker of nyckelharpas Eric Sahlström (1912-1986) used this new instrument and helped to re-popularize it in the mid-20th century. In spite of this, the nyckelharpa's popularity declined until the 1960s roots revival.|$|R
50|$|It is a fully <b>chromatic</b> <b>instrument,</b> having buttons in a {{rectangular}} arrangement of four staggered rows; its buttons are unisonoric, producing the same note {{on both the}} push and pull of the bellows. It differs from other concertinas in that the scale is divided evenly between the two hands, such that playing a scale involves both hands alternately playing each note in sequence.|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Concert cimbaloms: {{originally}} developed in Hungary by József Schunda in the 1870s. These instruments stand on four legs, {{have many more}} strings, and a damping pedal. The concert cymbalom has replaced most of the smaller folk tsymbaly previously used in Ukrainian orchestras and in Academic Conservatory courses. These <b>instruments</b> are fully <b>chromatic</b> and {{have a range of}} over four octaves.|$|R
50|$|After an interplay {{with the}} orchestra, the 2nd solo {{opens with a}} {{chromatic}} sequence using the raised 4th and descends using the 'b' natural note creating a Spanish flavor in the key of A minor. This passage also hints at Paganini's more comical side while further demonstrating his command of the <b>instrument</b> with string-skipping, <b>chromatic</b> runs, double-stop slides in tenths, and fluid scale runs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the eighth}} century, three yu and three sheng {{were sent to}} the Japanese court and these have been {{preserved}} in the Shōsōin imperial repository in Nara. All the instruments had 17 pipes with a long curving mouthpiece and are very similar to the traditional sheng in use today. However variants with different numbers of pipes, and <b>chromatic</b> <b>instruments</b> have been documented over the centuries.|$|R
50|$|Although both {{instruments}} are tuned normally to a diatonic scale, on slower pieces, accidentals {{can be created}} by sharping individual notes. This is accomplished by pushing and tensioning {{the section of the}} string behind the bridge with one finger while playing the string normally. This is similar to a technique used in Japanese koto playing. For faster chromatic pieces a pedal called a pitch shifter {{can be used to make}} the <b>instrument</b> fully <b>chromatic.</b> The pedal can be set to momentarily jump shift the entire instrument's tuning one-half step up or down, or it can be set on continuous pitch shift change which enables playing the instrument in dobro, slide guitar, or pedal steel guitar styles.|$|R
50|$|Many of the banduras {{used in the}} Kuban {{were made}} by Kiev bandura maker Antin Paplynsky, however, the Kuban also had its own bandura makers such as M. Veres (Saratovskaya stanitsa) G. Huzar (Kanevskaya stanitsa) P. Kikot' (Gelendzhik), Kuzma Nimchenko (Pashkovskaya stanitsa) D. Dykun (Yekaterinodar) S. Tuchinsky (Azovskaya stanitsa). Antin Chorny {{continued}} making banduras in Argentina. Initially instruments were diatonically tuned, having some 32 strings.

50|$|Kharkiv bandura {{manufacture}} was continued by the Honcharenko {{brothers who}} took the standard Kharkiv bandura {{as the basis for}} their design. They improved on the acoustics and construction of the <b>instruments</b> adding a <b>chromatic</b> row of strings, placing the tuning pegs on the lower shemstok and improving the retuning mechanism.

The chromatic aberration of EmpressΙΙ samples on different background color could be distinguished by human eyes, but those of Alumina and Zirconium were unable to being distinguished. In conclusion, {{the influence of}} background color to Empress ΙΙ and In-Ceram Alumina of AL 1 were lager. When chosen as core material, noble metals should be covered to keep prosthesis from clinical color-transform. As background to In-Ceram Alumina of AL 2, it was unnecessary for resin to be covered.

40|$|Carl Dolmetsch (1911 - 1997) is {{regarded}} as the first recorder virtuoso of the twentieth century, and the legacy of new music he commissioned and premiered was fundamental to the establishment of a contemporary repertoire for the instrument. The performing material for much of this music is preserved in the Dolmetsch archive, and contains not only his own annotations, but also those of his musical colleague of over sixty years, the harpsichordist Joseph Saxby. Careful examination of this material, together with a study of their extant recordings, and correspondence with the composers, provides evidence of Dolmetsch's performing practice related to alternative fingering, note alteration (for technical and aesthetic reasons), articulation, dynamics, tempo, ornamentation and cadenzas. We also gain insight into the use of two devices Dolmetsch developed and added to the recorder: the bell key, to complete and extend the <b>instrument's</b> <b>chromatic</b> compass, and the lip key, to enable greater dynamic contrast. Saxby's annotations in the harpsichord parts, relate mainly to registration. These and other performance practices must be seen {{in the context of the}} instruments originally played, since the manner in which these differed from those presently in use directly affected aspects of Dolmetsch and Saxby's performance and interpretation. The annotations in the performing material and, to an extent, the recordings of these works, reveal a performing style that owed something to early music performance practice, no doubt inherited from Dolmetsch's father Arnold, a seminal figure in the early music revival. They also reflect a desire to concentrate first and foremost on communicating the shape and progress of the music rather than striving for the accurate reproduction of the musical text, a characteristic of performance practice from the first half of the twentieth century. Performers coming fresh to this music will naturally arrive at their own interpretation. Nevertheless, an awareness of what is revealed by the original performing material and other primary sources can only serve to inform the modem performer - whatever their eventual interpretational decisions...|$|R
50|$|The firm Öllerer built a {{diatonic}} instrument with Cassotto, {{which has}} a small register switch two choirs with two 8' (M) choirs. In diatonic instruments the Cassotto's mounting is heavier, as a result, {{there is a great}} difference in the arrangement of pinblocks. In <b>chromatic</b> <b>instruments,</b> a Cassotto does not perform equally in every tone. The darker tones are mostly from a Stimmstock (German diatonic accordion), which are installed closer to the upper edge of the filing. As a result, the Cassotto effect is less pronounced for the Stimmstock.|$|R

5000|$|A signal {{instrument}} is {{a musical instrument}} which is not only used for music as such, but also fit to give sound signals {{as a form of}} auditive communication, usually in the open air. Signal instruments are often contrasted with melodic and diatonic or <b>chromatic</b> <b>instruments</b> ("a musical (rather than signal) instrument" [...] is not uncommon phrasing). To make the message audible at a distance, percussion and brass instruments, which are generally loud, are chiefly used for this purpose. There are contemporary instruments which evolved from signal instruments, such as the natural horn evolving to the trumpet.|$|R
