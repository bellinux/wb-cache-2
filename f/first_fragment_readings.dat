25|$|One {{approach}} for exhaustive enumeration goes as follows. Loop construction begins by aligning all possible fragments to overlap {{with the three}} residues at the N terminus of the loop (the anchor point).

30|$|LHP [10] {{tries to}} improve the {{detection}} probability by fragmentation. In LHP, each data frame is fragmented before being transmitted over the wireless link and the <b>first</b> <b>fragment</b> that contains the TCP/IP header is sent repeatedly prior {{to the rest of}} the fragments until it is successfully transmitted or all allocated link time slots for the frame are exhausted. When the receiver does not receive the whole frame except the <b>first</b> <b>fragment,</b> the receiver regards it as a wireless loss and sends an ACK packet with the ELN bit set. By fragmentation, LHP can increase the transmission probability of the TCP/IP header portion, which after all improves the detection probability. LHP also utilizes selective acknowledgement and the packet list which manages congestion control by keeping the unacknowledged packets in the sending order. However, the <b>first</b> <b>fragment</b> has to be transmitted successfully, which increases detection delay. Moreover, the <b>first</b> <b>fragment</b> can still be lost. Also, ACK packets that notify the wireless loss should go through wireless medium and this increases the detection failure probability and the notification delay further. The packet list works poorly with detection failures because the sender retransmits packets redundantly and invokes congestion control if the notification fails. If SMART [20] is used for LHP, whenever an ACK is lost, congestion control is invoked because the SMART ACK only contains the information of the single packet which has been successfully received and has triggered the ACK. In addition, fragmentation increases header overhead considerably, especially in 802.11 [21].|$|R
