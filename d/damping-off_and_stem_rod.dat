40|$|The <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> rot disease {{syndrome}} is harmful to many cultivated crops. <b>Damping-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. on cowpea results in yield losses with serious socio-economic implications. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to investigate the occurrence of the diseases in Benin, study etiology and factors influencing the diseases, and develop strategies for the control of the diseases in the field. Results showed that the diseases are distributed countrywide. Sclerotium rolfsii was the main causal agent but minor pathogens, namely Pythium sp., Rhizoctonia solani Kühn and Phoma pomorum Thüm were also recorded. In the Ouémé valley, the diseases were favoured by soil moisture and S. rolfsii initial inoculum that were higher closer to the river. Sclerotium rolfsii isolates collected in the valley showed genetic diversity in terms of pathogenicity, mycelial compatibility groups and ITS rDNA sequences. A paper-based screening method was found to be a rapid laboratory method for screening for resistance in cowpea cultivars. Furtheremore, Moringa oleifera L. leaf extracts, Trichoderma Kd 63 and Trichoderma IITA 508 significantly reduced the disease incidence. The best disease control was recorded in the field when M. oleifera seed treatment was integrated with a soil sprinkle of Trichoderma.

40|$|The role of {{phenolics}} {{in plant}} tolerance to pathogen infection is well documented. The {{objective of the}} present preliminary investigation was to study phenolic metabolites involved in the tolerance or susceptibility of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp.) cultivars to Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. and to use their presence as a possible screening tool. Total, free acid, ester-bound and cell wall-bound phenolics of 10 cowpea cultivars were quantified. In healthy seedlings, the tolerant cultivars displayed the higher phenol content than the susceptible cultivars. In S. rolfsii infected seedlings, the highest increase was found from 48 h after inoculation. The net effect of inoculation was a 630 % increase in total phenolics (soluble and insoluble) in the stem of tolerant cultivars while the total phenolic content increased only by 212 % in the stems of susceptible cultivars. Two phytoalexins were detected. Although, no significant difference (P = 0. 05) was detected among cultivars, in terms of free acid phenolics, the amount of ester-bound and cell wall-bound phenolics significantly increased, therefore demonstrating a similar trend to the one observed for the total phenolic content. These preliminary {{results showed that the}} presence of phenolics before and after S. rolfsii infection may be used as a rapid screening method for detection of tolerance to S. rolfsii <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> rot of cowpea.

40|$|Rhizoctonia solani is {{a common}} soil-borne {{pathogen}} that causes seed rot, <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rot during the production of vegetable seedlings in the greenhouse. Plant crowding, variable temperatures, over-watering and high humidity favor <b>damping-off,</b> <b>and</b> there are no fungicides highly effective against damping-off pathogens that are labeled for greenhouse use. Muscodor albus, an endophytic fungus obtained from Cinnamomum zeylanicum L. in Honduras, produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds toxic to fungi, bacteria and nematodes (1, 2, 3). Rye grain cultures of M. albus controlled damping-off caused by R. solani or Pythium ultimum in broccoli seedlings in a potting mix in the greenhouse (4), and other formulations were also effective in other systems (5). The fungus Trichoderma {{has been shown to}} be particularly effective in the control of the pathogen. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain biocontrol of R. solani, namely production of antibiotics (6) and hydrolytic enzymes (7, 8), mycoparasitism and hyphal disruption (9). Trichoderma spp. may affect the viability of sclerotia of R. solani (10).

Relationships were statistically modeled using linear and generalized linear models and boosted regression trees. Modeling found complex relationships between explanatory variables and the extent of Pythium <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rot. Linear modeling identified high-level (4 or 5 -way) significant interactions for each dependent variable (dry shoot and root weight, emergence, tap and lateral root disease index). Furthermore, all explanatory variables (temperature, soil, moisture, nutrition, variety) were found significant as part of some interaction within these models. A significant five-way interaction between all explanatory variables was found for both dry shoot and root dry weights, and a four way interaction between temperature, soil, moisture, and nutrition was found for both tap and lateral root disease index. A second approach to modeling using boosted regression trees provided support for and helped clarify the complex nature of the relationships found in linear models. All explanatory variables showed at least 5 % relative influence on each of the five dependent variables. All models indicated differences due to soil type, with the sand-based soil having either higher weights, greater emergence, or lower disease indices; while lowest weights and less emergence, as well as higher disease indices, were found for loam soil and low temperature.

40|$|Rhizoctonia solani is {{a species}} complex {{comprising}} 13 anastomosis groups (AG) that cause disease {{in a broad}} range of crops. Various AGs of R. solani are pathogenic to winter wheat causing <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rots. Rhizoctonia cerealis, the fungal agent of sharp eyespot, is known to commonly occur on the stems of wheat as part of stem base disease complex (SBD) consisting also of eyespot and brown foot rot (BFR). Eyespot is caused by Oculimacula acuformis or O. yallundae and BFR is principally caused by Microdochium nivale or M. majus. The population dynamics of SBD pathogens are continually changing due to environmental and agronomic pressures. Therefore, information on the current population dynamics and factors that influence population changes can guide the implementation of effective control measures.

30|$|Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food legumes for human consumption in the world. Several soil-borne fungi attacked bean plants causing <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rot/wilt diseases. These diseases were commonly attributed to Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. in complex with Rhizoctonia solani and F. oxysporum (Abdel-Kader 1997; Estevez de Jensen et al. 1999, 2002). The disease incidence of <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> bean root rot has risen with the increased acreage of this crop, the shortening of crop rotation intervals, and the use of highly susceptible cultivars. Yield losses in several infested areas approach 50 % (Estevez de Jensen et al. 2002). Biocontrol treatment with certain strains of Trichoderma spp. can be used for controlling several soil-borne diseases such as <b>damping-off,</b> root-rot, <b>and</b> wilt (El-Nagdi and Abd-El-Khair 2014; Woo et al. 2014; Elshahawy et al. 2017 a, 2017 b). Biological control methods are safe and environmentally friendly pesticide alternatives in agriculture application (Elshahawy et al. 2017 c). But biological control alone is sometimes un-sufficient to eradicate or reduce the propagules of the pathogens. Therefore, integration methods between biocontrol agents and the fungicides could be effective. The tolerance of several biocontrol agents to fungicides was studied by many workers over the world (Howell et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2005; Howell 2007; Vasundara et al. 2015; Khalequzzaman 2016). In a previous study, we investigated in vitro the compatibility of ten Trichoderma spp. isolates (three of T. harzianum, three of T. viride, one of T. virens, and three of Trichoderma spp.) with seven fungicides viz., carbendazim, flutolanil, mancozeb, metalaxyl M + mancozeb, pencycuron, thiram + tolclofos-methyl, and thiophanate-methyl (Elshahawya et al. 2016). The results of our investigations revealed that each of flutolanil, pencycuron, and thiophanate-methyl when separately combined with Trichoderma spp. isolates reduced the growth of the tested soil-borne pathogens in the ranges of 22.2 – 100 %, 43.7 – 100 %, and 50.4 – 100 %, compared to the reduction of 0.0 – 21.1 %, 0.0 – 18.9 %, and 15.6 – 18.9 % resulted by the same fungicides when used alone, respectively. Our results suggested that the fungicides-Trichoderma spp. isolate combination may be effective in controlling soil-borne pathogenic fungi than individual treatment and reduced the amount of fungicide used. The results of our investigations revealed that Trichoderma spp. were highly compatible with thiophanate-methyl. Therefore, this work is amid to study the effects of Trichoderma spp. combined with thiophanate-methyl for controlling <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rot/wilt diseases of bean caused by F. solani and F. oxysporium in a greenhouse and in field experiments.|$|R

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), {{is a major}} oilseed in both Turkey and Egypt as well as worldwide, two of {{the most}} {{important}} diseases of sunflower are <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> charcoal-rot. <b>Damping-off</b> is caused by the following pathogenic fungi: Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticillioides, Rhizoctonia solani and Macrophomina phaseolina. Charcoal-rot, on the other hand, is incited by the soil inhabiting fungus Macrophomina phaseolina. Damping-off as well as charcoal-rot causes important economic loss in the main production areas of sunflower around the world. In this study we selected certain sunflower fields from Egypt and Turkey to collect the fungi associated with the roots of sunflower plants so as to isolate the causal pathogens of <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> charcoal-rot. The isolated fungi were able to infect sunflower plants under artificial infection and cause the symptoms of pre- <b>and</b> post- emergence <b>damping-off</b> as well as charcoal-rot. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. phaseolina in sunflower in Turkey. We performed the first study with sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) for an overview of genetic diversity and phenetic relationships present among the isolates of Macrophomina and Fusarium. Results showed that Turkish and Egyptian isolates of M. phaseolina were clustered together with a genetic similarity of 60 %; similarly, Turkish and Egyptian isolates of F. oxysporum were clustered together with a genetic similarity of 75 %. Infection reactions of 41 sunflower cultivars for infection with charcoal-rot disease were also evaluated. Results indicated that certain sunflower cultivars are resistant to charcoal-rot, but the most cultivars are susceptible. A relationship between root exudates and the mechanism of sunflower plant resistance to charcoal-rot <b>and</b> <b>damping-off</b> was found. The application of biological control agents, under greenhouse conditions, significantly reduced plant mortality and increased surviving plants. These agents can readily be used to gain more resistance to charcoal-rot disease in sunflower...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{mixing and}} thermal fatigue {{has led to}} {{component}} failures in the nuclear industry. The thermal fatigue phenomenon is intimately linked with the mixing of streams of different temperatures in proximity to a solid wall. Due to conjugate heat transfer, temperature fluctuations are induced in the wall. One of the key issues is to predict the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} the fluctuations. This paper presents pre-calculations of the thermal mixing experiments that are under preparation at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology as part of the THEMFE project (Thermal Mixing and Fatigue Experiment). The proposed geometry is a simplification of a reactor control rod and consists of a top-tube <b>and</b> control <b>rod</b> <b>stem,</b> which are modeled as concentric cylinders. In addition there are only two hot inlet jets and two cold inlet jets, whereas in reality there are 8 upper inlets and 4 lower inlets for hot bypass water and the cold flow is annular. Thermal mixing was studied by using a transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver for the incompressible filtered Navier-Stokes equations and employing a Large Eddy Simulation model of turbulence implemented in OpenFOAM. The aim was to verify that the proposed simplified geometry and the flow conditions of the experiment will lead to low frequent temperature fluctuations of the order of 0. 1 - 1 Hz, as seen in previous experiments with the real geometry. Such low frequencies are typical for the thermal fatigue phenomenon. The study was focused on the region near the control <b>rod</b> <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> therefore a refined grid was used in that region. The final mesh consisted of over one million cells. The results did indeed reveal low frequent temperature fluctuations in {{the lower part of the}} mixing region near the control <b>rod</b> <b>stem.</b> The results of this paper indicate that the length of the mixing region is 23 cm, which is large enough to be resolved in the experiment. It was also found that the most dangerous region, where the dominant high amplitude temperature fluctuations have a frequency of the order of 0. 1 Hz, is 4 cm long. As expected, the instant flow field is asymmetric with large secondary flows. The present results verify that the proposed geometry and flow conditions can be applied in the experiment.

40|$|Within {{agricultural}} ecosystems {{the abundance}} {{and activities of}} diverse microbial populations affecting plant health can be significantly influenced by farm management practices. This work describes the effects of transitional cropping strategies on <b>damping-off</b> incidence <b>and</b> on soil and rhizosphere bacterial, fungal and oomycete communities. Specifically, individual microbial populations were associated with <b>damping-off</b> incidence <b>and</b> the suppression thereof, and two novel bacterial species were characterized {{for their ability to}} reduce seedling disease severity. Soils from an organic transition experiment exhibited different levels of damping-off suppression, with a perennial mixed hay transition consistently suppressing <b>damping-off</b> of tomato <b>and</b> soybean. Microbial community analyses were performed from the rhizosphere and surrounding soil of tomato and soybean seedlings grown in soils previously exposed to different transition strategies. The abundance of Pseudomonas and DAPG-producing Pseudomonas populations, did not clearly associate with disease levels. However, the analysis of bacterial, fungal and oomycete community profiles (generated from terminal restriction fragment lengt...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in soil {{and can cause}} important soybean diseases such as <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> soybean root rot. At least twelve different species of Fusarium {{have been reported to}} infect soybean roots, but their relative aggressiveness as root rot pathogens is not known. In some cases, these root rots can be exacerbated by other pathogens, such as the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). The most important species of Fusarium causing root rot on soybean, as well as their interactions and overall impact on soybean productivity, are unclear. To determine whether SCN infestation enhances Fusarium root rot in soybean, field experiments were conducted using cultivars that differ in genetic resistance to SCN...|$|R

5000|$|Pythium ultimum is a plant pathogen. It {{causes the}} <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> root rot {{diseases}} {{of hundreds of}} diverse plant hosts including corn, soybean, potato, wheat, fir, and many ornamental species. [...] P. ultimum belongs to the peronosporalean lineage of oomycetes, along with other important plant pathogens such as Phytophthora spp. and many genera of downy mildews. Py. ultimum is a frequent inhabitant of fields, freshwater ponds, and decomposing vegetation in most areas of the world. Contributing to the widespread distribution and persistence of Py. ultimum {{is its ability to}} grow saprotrophically in soil and plant residue. This trait is also exhibited by most Pythium spp. but not by the related Phytophthora spp., which can only colonize living plant hosts.|$|R
25|$|Springtails {{are well}} known as pests of some {{agricultural}} crops. Sminthurus viridis, the lucerne flea, {{has been shown to}} cause severe damage to agricultural crops, and is considered as a pest in Australia. Onychiuridae are also known to feed on tubers and to damage them to some extent. However, by their capacity to carry spores of mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhiza-helper bacteria on their tegument, soil springtails play a positive role in the establishment of plant-fungal symbioses and thus are beneficial to agriculture. They also contribute to controlling plant fungal diseases through their active consumption of mycelia <b>and</b> spores of <b>damping-off</b> <b>and</b> pathogenic fungi. It has been suggested that they could be reared to be used for the control of pathogenic fungi in greenhouses and other indoor cultures.|$|R

On-farm surveys were undertaken from November 1988 to October 1991 to identify nursery and field diseases in major tomato producing areas of Cameroon, <b>Damping-off</b> <b>and</b> seedling blights were the main seedling diseases. Of the eleven diseases observed in the field, the most widely distributed and severe on the foliage and fruits were early (Alternaria solani) and late (Phytophthora infestans) blights. Late blight was the most severe disease in the wet season while early blight was most severe in the dry season. Nine pathogens were associated with various fruit rots.
