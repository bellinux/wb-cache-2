Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began <b>in</b> <b>mid-September.</b> While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E

5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when <b>in</b> <b>mid-September,</b> Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials began <b>in</b> <b>mid-September</b> 1944 {{and were}} {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. <b>In</b> <b>mid-September,</b> Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
