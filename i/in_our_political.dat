500|$|Flanders {{argues that}} nonhuman animals could be [...] "below" [...] politics, {{in that they}} do not have {{politically}} considerable interests, or [...] "above" [...] politics, in that they have rights which trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of animal cruelty may be a [...] "fixed point" [...] <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>political</b> reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides a good starting point for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.|$|E

500|$|Bazy (then Miller) was {{publisher}} of the newspaper for only 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, [...] "I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me... There is some difference <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>political</b> beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [...] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people." [...] McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be {{given a chance to}} purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.|$|E

It wasn't set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation."

Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that [...] "someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric." [...] His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that [...] "invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable—on either side of the aisle.

What I said during the referendum campaign is I want my country back. What I'm saying today is I want my life back.

[...] Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, described Farage as a [...] "retro-nationalist", Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said that his legacy is [...] "toxic and unforgivable" [...] and that [...] "He has used his position to whip up hatred against migrants and divert attention from the real challenges this country is facing", and former Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, said: [...] "It's a legacy of stirring up division. I am not sorry to see Nigel Farage leave the political scene". However, Paul Nuttall, a UKIP MEP, tweeted that Farage's [...] "drive and belief shook establishment politics to its core and gave us a voice" [...] and Suzanne Evans, former Deputy Chairman of UKIP, said that Farage's resignation surprised her, but [...] "there is room still in Britain for UKIP". Writing in The Spectator, after this resignation when it was thought he was leaving politics, the journalist Rod Liddle described Farage as: [...] "The most important British politician of the last decade and the most successful. His resignation leaves a hole <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>political</b> system. With enormous intelligence and chutzpah and a refreshingly unorthodox approach, he built UKIP up from nothing to become established as our third largest party and succeeded in his overriding ambition – to see the UK vote to leave the European Union." ...|$|E
