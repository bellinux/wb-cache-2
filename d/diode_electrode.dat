40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} theoretical and experimental {{analysis of the}} current response of GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal Schottky photodiodes exposed to 70 fs optical pulses. Theoretical simulations of the carrier transport in these structures by a self- consistent twodimensional Monte Carlo calculation reveal the strong influence of {{the distance between the}} finger electrodes, the extemal voltage, the GaAs layer thickness and the excitation intensity on the response time and the corresponding frequency bandwidth of these photodetectors. For many experimental conditions, the model demonstrates a clear temporal separation of the electron and hole contributions to the output current due to the different mobilities of the two carrier types. For a <b>diode</b> with an <b>electrode</b> separation of 0. 5 mym, an electric-field strength above 10 kV/cm and low intensity of the incident light the theory predicts a pulse rise time below 2 ps, an initial rapid decay as short as 5 ps associated with the electr on sweep out and a subsequent slower tail attributed to the hole current. For weaker electric fields and/or higher light intensities a significant slowing down of the detector speed is predicted because of effective screening of the electric field by the photoexcited carriers. Heterostructure layer-based devices are shown to provide superior performance compared to diodes manufactured on bulk substrates. Experimental data obtained by photoconductive or electro-optic sampling on <b>diodes</b> with <b>electrode</b> separation between 0. 5 and 1. 2 mym agree fairly well with the theoretical predictions...|$|R

The electrode that allows positive charges to flow into it would be the anode, but that electrode would never allow positive charges to flow out, so that ideal diode terminal could never be the cathode.

25|$|A diode is a two-terminal {{electronic}} component that conducts current primarily {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.

A vacuum tube <b>diode</b> has two <b>electrodes,</b> a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874.

Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|R
25|$|Except for <b>diodes,</b> {{additional}} <b>electrodes</b> {{are positioned}} between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes {{are referred to}} as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass {{on their way to the}} plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{conductive}} electrodes {{are critical}} to the operation of optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaic cells and light emitting <b>diodes.</b> Effective <b>electrodes</b> need to combine excellent electrical and optical properties. Metal oxides, such as indium tin oxide, are commonly used. There is substantial interest in replacing them, however, motivated by practical problems and recent discoveries regarding the optics of nano-patterned metals. When designing nano-patterned metallic films for use as electrodes, one needs to account for both optical and electrical properties. In general, it is insufficient to optimize nano-structured films based upon optical properties alone, since structural variations will also affect the electrical properties. In this work, we investigate the need for simultaneous optical and electrical performance by analyzing the optical properties of a class of nano-patterned metallic electrodes that is obtained by a constant-sheet-resistance transformation. Within such a class the electrical and optical properties can be separated, i. e., the sheet resistance can be kept constant and the transmittance can be optimized independently. For simple one-dimensional periodic patterns with constant sheet-resistance, we find a transmission maximum (polarization-averaged) when the metal sections are narrow (100 nm). Our design carries over to more complex two-dimensional (2 D) patterns. This is significant as there are no previous reports regarding numerical studies on the optical and electrical properties of 2 D nano-patterns {{in the context of}} electrode design...|$|R

40|$|The unique {{properties}} of metal-oxide semiconductors make them {{well suited to}} a variety of optoelectronic applications. Metal oxides comprise all industrially-relevant transparent conductors (TCs), and there is significant interest in their development as photovoltaic (PV) absorbers, light-emitting <b>diodes,</b> and <b>electrodes</b> in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. TCs are heavily-doped, wide-bandgap semiconductors that must simultaneously exhibit high conductivity and high optical transparency across (and beyond) the visible spectral range, but such materials face severe fundamental tradeoffs between transparency and conductivity that preclude the use of TCs in a number of applications that require infrared and near-infrared transparency. High-mobility TC materials such as CdO can acheive a better balance of transparency and conductivity, but their short-wavelength transparency is limited by a low intrinsic direct bandgap of 2. 2 eV. This dissertation explores how the {{properties of}} CdO can be tuned by bandgap engineering and doping and discusses their use in TC and photoelectrochemical applications. Alloys of the structurally-mismatched endpoint compounds CdO [...] ZnO have attracted considerable interest within the field of oxide bandgap engineering as they allow the bandgap of ZnO (3. 3 eV) to be tuned across the visible range with the incorporation of Cd into hexagonal ZnO. Little is known about the properties of cubic alloys based on Zn in CdO, however. The correlated structural, optical, and electrical properties of Cd x Zn 1 -x thin film alloys (0 x Zn 1 -x alloys are determined by three complementary techniques: ion-irradiation-induced pinning of the Fermi level at the Fermi-level stabilization energy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and soft X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. The three techniques find consensus in explaining the origin of compositional trends in the optical-bandgap narrowing upon Cd incorporation in wurtzite ZnO and widening upon Zn incorporation in rocksalt CdO. The conduction band minimum is found to be stationary for both wurtzite and rocksalt alloys, and a significant upward rise of the valence band maximum accounts for the majority of these observed bandgap changes. These band alignment details, combined with the unique optical and electrical properties of the two phase regimes, make Cd x Zn 1 -x alloys attractive candidates for PEC water splitting applications. A proposed device structure of a Cd x Zn 1 -x O-Si tandem PEC is presented. Finally, the unique electrical properties and doping behavior of CdO are examined using simulations based on the amphoteric defect model. The calculated doping and mobility limits are compared with experimental values for Ga-doped CdO...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the low‐voltage arc mode of the hot‐cathode discharge {{has been carried out}} in a <b>diode</b> utilizing planar <b>electrode</b> geometry. The investigation consisted predominantly of Langmuir‐probe measurements of the discharge in a neon atmosphere. Measurements were also obtained in argon, xenon, and hydrogen and hydrogen‐neon and argon‐neon mixtures. The probes were of planar, guard‐ringed geometry. The volt‐ampere characteristic of the hot‐cathode discharge in the Torr range of gas pressure was investigated to further define the low‐voltage arc. For ample electron emission at the cathode there are two stable high‐current, low‐voltage discharge modes that occur in the noble gases; these are termed the low‐voltage arc and the ball‐of‐fire modes of the hot‐cathode discharge. No low‐voltage discharge modes were obtained in hydrogen. The steady‐state characteristics obtained for the low‐voltage arc indicated peak plasma potentials of approximately 14, 6, and 4. 5 V for neon, argon, and xenon, respectively, considerably lower than the first excitation level of the respective gases. There is a minimum value of the product of pressure and electrode spacing for the existence of the low‐voltage arc; this condition also yields a minimum value of discharge voltage. The discharge voltage and peak electron densities increase with increasing pressure‐ spacing product, while the peak plasma potential decreases gradually. Measurements on the discharge in neon atmospheres containing small admixtures of hydrogen indicated that cumulative ionization is important for the generation of the low‐voltage arc. It was not possible to detect in the measurements on pure noble gas experimental atmospheres any effects due to the presence of impurities. The study of the Penning impurity effect in the low‐voltage arc was limited, but showed that mixtures of less than 0. 06 % argon in neon do affect the discharge...|$|R
