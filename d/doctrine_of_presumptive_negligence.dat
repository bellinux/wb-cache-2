In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state.

He believed that courts should protect the right to free speech even against the majority will. In Hand's view, judges must remain detached at times when public opinion is hostile to minorities and governments issue laws to repress those minorities. Hand was the first judge to rule on a case arising from the Espionage Act of 1917, which sought to silence opposition to the war effort. In his decision on Masses Publishing Co. v.

This essay addresses this issue – of discretion in the context <b>of</b> a <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> substantively unconstitutional constitutional amendments – by considering the possibility of courts limiting the scope of their discretion by linking notions of what is “fundamental” in a domestic constitutional system to common or generic transnational legal practices. This idea of transnational anchoring builds on previous work by scholars in the field, such as Vicki Jackson, but also implicitly advances a new understanding of what it means to engage with transnational legal sources based on the idea <b>of</b> posture <b>of</b> <b>presumptive</b> nondivergence from the transnational...|$|R

40|$|The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> "patent exhaustion" {{implies that}} the {{authorized}} sale of patented goods "exhausts" the patent rights in the goods sold and precludes additional license fees from downstream buyers. This paper offers the first formal economic model of domestic patent exhaustion that incorporates transaction costs in consumer licensing, and examines how a shift in patent policy from absolute to presumptive exhaustion, in which the patent owner can opt- out of exhaustion via contract, affects social welfare. The results show that when transaction costs are low, presumptive exhaustion is socially optimal, because it allows welfare-enhancing price discrimination via downstream licensing. Conversely, when transaction costs are high, the regime <b>of</b> <b>presumptive</b> patent exhaustion leads to a greater loss of static efficiency, because transaction cost frictions offset the benefits of price discrimination, but dynamic benefits in promoting ex ante investment in product quality may outweigh any static inefficiencies...|$|R

The study adopted a descriptive research design and questionnaires, interviews and observations were used to collect qualitative data. SSPS version 16 was used to analyse the data.

The major results of the study revealed that ZIMRA needs to do more educational campaigns to inform tax payers and that presumptive tax negatively affects the viability of SMEs.

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.
