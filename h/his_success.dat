5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer.

He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|After his MVP season, Killebrew {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ today).

He spent most of the season's first half continuing <b>his</b> <b>success,</b> and found Baltimore's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued <b>his</b> <b>success</b> through {{the second half of the}} year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore's Boog Powell, who won the award. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, a rematch of the previous season. The Twins were again swept, though Killebrew's performance improved as he hit two home runs in three games.|$|E
