He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen.

Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were the <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
