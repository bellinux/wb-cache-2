40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{a two-way}} {{drainage}} deposit under a surcharge load, {{due to the}} vertical drainage capacity of a natural deposit, {{it is possible to}} leave a layer adjacent to the bottom drainage boundary without prefabricated vertical drain (PVD) improvement and achieve approximately the same degree of consolidation as a fully penetrated case. This depth is designated as an optimum PVD <b>installation</b> <b>depth</b> under a surcharge load. Further, for a two-way drainage deposit under a vacuum pressure, if the PVDs are fully penetrated through the deposit, the vacuum pressure will leak through the bottom drainage boundary. In this case, the PVDs have to be partially penetrated, and there is an optimum <b>installation</b> <b>depth</b> which resulting the maximum consolidation settlement. The equations for calculating these optimum installation depths are presented, and the usefulness of the equations is studied by using one-dimensional finite element analysis as well as laboratory test results...|$|E

Performance {{analyses}} of vertical ground-loop heat exchanger configurations have been widely carried out using both numerical modelling and experiments. However, research findings and design recommendations on horizontal slinky-loop and vertical slinky-loop heat exchangers are far fewer compared with those for vertical ground-loop heat exchanger configurations, especially where the long-term operation of the systems is concerned. The paper presents the results obtained from a numerical simulation for the horizontal slinky-loop and vertical slinky-loop heat exchangers of a ground-source heat pump system. A three-dimensional numerical heat transfer model was developed to study the thermal performance of various heat exchanger configurations.

For this type of application big <b>installation</b> <b>depths</b> (leff > 20 d) and screw lengths (l > 0. 6 m) are required which cause problems regarding precisely positioned installation. Due to the inhomogeneity of wood as a natural material, even at medium size lengths the screws tend to 'stray' i. e. a deviation of the screw tip from the designated axis occurs which is increasing disproportionately with growing screw lengths. While for shorter screws mechanically drilled holes are commonly used as guidance, for longer screws potentially only laser-drilled holes can ensure a straight direction of the screw axis. The high energy and heat input of the laser beam results in a thermal modification of the wood around the drill hole, thus presumably influencing the load bearing and bond behaviour of screws that are screwed into such holes.

40|$|Summary. The {{objective}} of the paper was to prepare a method describing a minimum depth for installation of a ground heat exchanger in the heat pumps systems. The lower is the loca-tion depth of the horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHE), the lower are the geothermal in-stallation costs with the horizontal ground heat exchanger and consequently the higher cost-effectiveness of an investment. A task of two-criteria optimization was formulated – i. e. de-termination of the minimum depth and a diameter of the HGHE pipes assuming a particular temperature of the operational factor on the output from the HGHE. Reduction of {{the depth of the}} HGHE translates into the decrease of installation costs. The module of genetic algorithms from MatLab application was used to carry out optimization.

A tunnel segment at the Grimsel test site located in the Aare granite of the Bernese Alps (central Switzerland) has been subjected to a resaturation and, subsequently, to a controlled desaturation, Using thermocouple psychrometers (TP) and time domain reflectometry (TDR), the water potentials psi and water contents theta were measured within the unsaturated granodiorite matrix near the tunnel wall at depths between 0 and 160 cm. During the resaturation the water potentials in the first 30 cm from the rock surface changed within weeks from values of less than - 1. 5 MPa to near saturation. They returned to the negative initial values during desaturation, The dynamics of this saturation-desaturation regime could be monitored very sensitively using the thermocouple psychrometers, The TDR measurements indicated that water contents changed dose to the surface, but at deeper <b>installation</b> <b>depths</b> the observed changes were within the experimental noise. The field-measured data of the desaturation cycle were used to test the predictive capabilities of the hydraulic parameter functions that were derived from the water retention characteristics psi(theta) determined in the laboratory.

40|$|A new {{technology}} for energy storage called Subsea Pumped Hydro Storage (SPHS) has been evaluated from a techno-economical point of view. Intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} are becoming {{more common in the}} electricity grid; hence the need of regulating power is increasing. One way of balancing the demand of electricity with the production is by implementing energy storage in the system. This thesis has assessed such a concept, which is a sea-based version of the already existing pumped hydro storage technology. A SPHS unit is composed of a hollow structure placed at the seabed which can be emptied of water by the use of a pump at times of low demand and high production of electricity in the system, the unit is at that point charged. When this excess energy is needed in the system water is allowed to flow back into the cavity through a turbine and thus generating electricity. This work has defined which components are needed for the concept to function and how these are implemented to create a complete technical system. In order to compare SPHS to alternative solutions for energy storage, so called Key Performance Parameters were determined and quantified. The two technologies pumped hydro storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES) were used for comparison with the SPHS concept due to their similar operation characteristics. The last step of the analysis was performed with an energy systems model where energy storage was included in the Danish electricity system due to its high penetration of fluctuating wind power. A number of scenarios were examined and it was shown that at larger <b>installation</b> <b>depths</b> the capital cost was reduced due to a lower material requirement. It should however be clarified that the costs for <b>installation</b> at large <b>depths</b> are very uncertain. Compared to PHS (with a levelized cost of electricity, LCOE, of 187 - 278 €/MWh) it was concluded that the subsea pumped hydro storage concept (with a LCOE of 212 - 336 €/MWh) needs to be developed further in order to be competitive from a cost point of view. Furthermore, unless subsidies for the delivered electricity are implemented the storage technology will not yield a sufficient income when operating on the spot market as a buyer and seller of electricity. A better alternative could be to connect the technology to an offshore wind power plant where the wind energy can be stored directly as the wind turbine drives the pump in the storage unit mechanically. This would imply that electricity, which is more expensive than any other fuel, doesn’t have to be bought at market price and that the wind power plant and storage unit become one integrated facility...|$|R
