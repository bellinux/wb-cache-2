5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, {{in the last year of}} his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
25|$|Carrying out a {{military}} plan in winter {{was not the}} major failure of the operation. A valid {{question is whether or}} not the plan could have been executed better. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> exceed the performance of the Turkish soldiers. The IX and X Corps marched with maximum effectiveness given the conditions. The majority of the units managed to move to the correct positions. In respect to the inflicted Russian casualties, they should be credited.|$|E

25|$|The rise of DJs {{was really}} the next step for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the {{increase}} in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> rap in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Notably, while every {{witness to}} the Commission gave {{evidence}} of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where complainants or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by the complainants. Given Mr. Ahern's general apology in 1999, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> conclude otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Among the Doric temples, the Peisistratid Olympieion at Athens has {{a special}} position. Although this {{building}} was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic dipteros. Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of Samos so closely that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of Hippias in 510 BC, work on this structure was stopped: Democratic Athens {{had no desire to}} continue a monument of tyrannical self-aggrandisation.|$|E

25|$|Decentralization {{is also a}} key ideological idea to technoliberalism, {{sought to}} work though the {{deregulation}} of rules that stop businesses competing with the government services. Decentralization means distributing the power away {{from the center of}} an organization, diffusing authority outwards to workers in the field. The rapid growth of information technology has aided this concept as the likes of the internet have made the distribution of information accessible and cheap. On the other hand, is the ideological idea of free markets. Strongly enforced rules would be needed here as this type of market would be based on supply and demand with little government control. Technoliberalist's believe that knowledge and technology can be geographically transferred without much difficulty or state action, envisaging a completely free market where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact unreservedly, based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation. Whilst this is an idealized view, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> implement.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan. Five days {{before he was killed}} in South Ossetia, Evgeny Parfenov warned his parents not to call him because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reach him by phone. Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said {{that she was able to}} call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008. Eldar Lotfullin told journalist that the Georgian tanks fired on his barracks on 8 August.

500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that it would probably be the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{praised the}} film's sense of timeliness, writing, [...] "It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity... Reitman {{emerges as a}} modern-day Frank Capra, {{capturing}} the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." [...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job." ...|$|E

500|$|However Gardner's {{increasing}} {{desire for}} publicity, {{much of it}} ending up negative, caused conflict with Valiente {{and other members of}} his coven like Ned Grove and Derek Boothby. She felt that in repeatedly communicating with the press, he was compromising the coven's security. She was also not enthusiastic about two young people whom Gardner brought into the coven, Jack L. Bracelin and his girlfriend 'Dayonis', stating that [...] "a more qualid pair of spivs <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find indeed". Two factions emerged within the coven; Valiente led a broadly anti-publicity group, while Gardner led a pro-publicity one. In 1957, Valiente and Grove drew up a list of [...] "Proposed Rules of the Craft" [...] which were partly designed to curtail Gardner's publicity seeking. From his home in the Isle of Man, he responded that this was not necessary as a series of rules already existed, at which point he produced the Wiccan Laws. These laws limited the control of the High Priestess, which angered Valiente, who later realised that Gardner had simply made them up in response to her own Proposed Laws. In summer 1957, the coven split. According to Valiente, she and her followers [...] "had had enough of the Gospel according to St. Gerald; but we still believed that the real traditional witchcraft lived". According to Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White, [...] "Wicca had experienced its first great schism".|$|E
500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a catch-22, saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, {{to step up and}} compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E
500|$|Charles X Gustav's {{will and}} {{testament}} left {{the administration of}} the Swedish Empire during Charles XI's minority to a regency led by Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora as both formal regent and chair of a six-member Regency Council with two votes and a final say over the rest of the council. Per Brahe was one member of the council. [...] In addition, Charles X Gustav left command of the army and a seat on the council to his younger brother, Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg. These provisions among others led to the remainder of the council immediately challenging the will. February 14, the day after King Charles X's death, Hedwig Eleonora sent a message to the council stating that she knew that they contested the will and that she demanded that it should be respected. The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament, and at the following council in Stockholm on May 13, the council tried to keep her from attending. The parliament questioned whether {{it would be good for}} her health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council. Hedwig Eleonora's ostensible indifference to politics came as a great relief to the lords of the guardian government.|$|E
