The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive <b>energy</b> <b>plan.</b> The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

40|$|Denmark's future {{energy system}} is to be entirely based on {{renewable}} energy sources.

Based on a review of 11 municipal <b>energy</b> <b>plans,</b> this paper examines to what extent municipal <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> matches national 100 % renewable energy strategies. The results indicate a willingness among Danish municipalities to actively carry out <b>energy</b> <b>planning,</b> and the plans reveal a large diversity of (new) activities. At the same time, however, there is a strong need for better coordination of municipal <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> activities at the central level. It is suggested that the role of municipalities as <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> authorities needs to be outlined more clearly in, e. g., strategic <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> which integrates savings, efficiency and renewable energy in all (energy) sectors. This requires the state to provide municipalities with the necessary planning instruments and establish a corresponding planning framework. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a simultaneous centralisation and decentralisation during the implementation of the 100 % renewable energy vision. The paper outlines a basic division of tasks between the central and the local level within such a strategic <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> system.

25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an <b>energy</b> <b>plan</b> that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E

40|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> {{endeavours}} for {{a particular}} region involves the finding {{of a set of}} sources and conversion devices so as to meet the energy requirement/demand of all the tasks in an optimal manner. This optimality depends on the objective to minimise the total annual cost of energy and the dependence on non-local resources or maximise the overall system efficiency. Factors such as availability of resources in the region and task energy requirements impose constraints on the regional <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> exercise. Thus, regional <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> {{turns out to be a}} constrained optimisation problem. This paper describes an optimum energy allocation using integrated <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> approaches for Uttara Kannada district and makes a satisfying <b>energy</b> allocation <b>plan</b> for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015. Integrated <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> gives an optimal mix of new/ conventional energy sources and is developed based on decision support systems (DSS) approach. The central theme of the <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> at decentralised level would be to prepare regional <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> to meet <b>energy</b> needs and development of alternate energy sources at least- cost to the economy and environment.

Unsustainable energy activities are identified as major threats on both local and global levels.

The literature review examines community <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> guidebooks and key theoretical and methodological concepts including ingenuity, soft energy paths and backcasting from socio-ecological principles of sustainability. Following an analysis of energy supply and demand in a broad systems context, and a review of policies and programs supporting or hindering community <b>energy</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> from eleven Swedish and eleven Canadian communities are evaluated. Characteristics of progressive <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> as uncovered in the literature review form a framework for evaluating the visions, strategies and actions described in the plans.

40|$|Energy {{is among}} the main driving forces needed for {{sustainable}} development. Provision of energy services, from the supply side to transmission/distribution and use, must include management, and good management requires tools. <b>Energy</b> <b>planning</b> is a tool for managing the community energy system through assessing and balancing supply and demand. This thesis explains an approach to <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> which increases the capacity for managing and developing the community energy system in a more sustainable manner. Explaining the logic of planological integration in planning theory, the author describes how this logic {{can be applied to}} existing <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> methods. These methods could be modified {{in such a way that}} fulfillment of sustainability objectives can be integrated into the <b>planning</b> process. <b>Energy</b> <b>planning</b> has been and is still used for managing the Swedish energy system at both national and local level. Since 1977, Swedish municipalities have been legally required to have a document called “Energy Plan” decided upon by the local government. Over 30 years of municipal <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> and its effectiveness in promoting the local energy system is studied in this thesis. The main objective is to investigate to what extent existing <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> methods can address energy-related sustainability objectives. A pilot project is carried out to examine whether proxy variables can be used to measure and monitor sustainability dimensions of local energy systems. It is observed that existing <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> praxis is less suitable in addressing sustainability objectives. The main reason for the shortcomings of existing <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> methods is that they typically have a narrow focus on local energy systems such as input-output (supply-demand) systems, which makes them inefficient as regards the transition toward sustainable energy systems. Other reasons identified include weaknesses in the relevant legal planning framework (the Municipal <b>Energy</b> <b>Planning</b> Act), problems caused by the deregulation of electricity markets, and a lack of financial resources for <b>energy</b> <b>planning.</b> Results from the pilot project indicate that properly defined energy indicators (such as energy use per capita, transport energy intensity, solid waste to energy) can be useful in monitoring the sustainability of local energy systems. It is observed that such energy indicators can also be useful in developing local energy systems through knowledge exchange and learning processes...|$|R
