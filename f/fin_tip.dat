2500|$|After {{the first}} few flights K5054 was {{returned}} to the factory, reappearing about 10 days later with an overall pale blue-grey finish, using a high-gloss automotive nitrocellulose-lacquer applied by people from the Rolls-Royce car plant (there is still some uncertainty over the actual colour). The tailskid originally fitted {{had been replaced by}} a Dowty manufactured, fully castoring tail-wheel unit. This tailwheel was to be modified several times on the prototype, including using twin tailwheels each smaller than the single wheel which was later standardised. The engine cowlings had been altered slightly and the angled <b>fin</b> <b>tip</b> had become straight topped – the rudder balance was correspondingly reduced in size. Undercarriage fairings had now been fitted to the legs. Although the propeller was still the fixed-pitch, wooden bladed unit the pitch had been changed in an attempt to increase the top speed.

50|$|B-36s made regular {{visits to}} England for {{exercises}} between 1951 and 1959.

The aircraft landed, giving the crowd an opportunity to closely inspect an SAC B-36. The aircraft was natural metal with a large Black triangle and S letter code on the fin. The last three digits of the serial were positioned on the forward fuselage sides, the <b>fin</b> <b>tip</b> was Black and the nose wheel doors were Black with a diagonal White stripe.|$|E
5000|$|A modex is {{a number}} {{that is part of}} the Aircraft Visual Identification System along with the aircraft's tail code. It usually {{consists}} of two or three numbers used by the Department of the Navy, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aircraft that identify a squadron's mission and a specific aircraft within a squadron. These numbers are painted conspicuously on the aircraft's nose, or on helicopters; sometimes on the aft portion of helicopters fuselage or forward portion of the empennage. Modexes are also painted less conspicuously on other aircraft areas (i.e., <b>fin</b> <b>tip,</b> flaps, etc.). Shore-based aviation units use either two-digit or three-digit modexes, while carrier-based units always use three digits.|$|E
50|$|A Spey-powered Phantom {{was not a}} new concept: McDonnell Douglas had {{considered}} the idea to meet the USAF TFX requirement, later satisfied by the General Dynamics F-111. The Spey gave an increase of 10% in operational range, 15% increase in ferry range and better low-level acceleration, however the increased drag of the engine installation resulted in poorer performance at high altitude. Although some of the design changes were unique to the British aircraft - folding radar radome, Spey engine, nose-wheel extension and strengthened arrester hook - the other structural changes and improvements {{were used in the}} design of the F-4J. After modifications in the 1970s, the tail had a new RWR system; a British-made Marconi ARI.18228 fitted in a rectangular antenna box on the <b>fin</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E

Caudal peduncle moderately long, distance from second dorsal insertion to upper caudal origin {{about as long as}} distance from eye to third gill slits.

50|$|One of {{the first}} Groups to arrive in England for a ninety-day tour was the 28th Bombardment Group which {{deployed}} from Rapid City AFB, South Dakota, to RAF Scampton during 1948. 28th BG aircraft carried a Black R within a Black circle {{on both sides of}} the fin. The R denoted the Group while the circle identified the parent unit, the 15th Air Force. Many units later carried their parent numbered Air Force unit badge on the base of the fin. These aircraft also had various colored nose wheel doors and <b>fin</b> <b>tips</b> denoting their respective squadrons.|$|R
50|$|The yelloweye {{rockfish}} is colored red on its back, orange {{to yellow}} on the sides, and black on the <b>fin</b> <b>tips.</b> Its young are typically under 28 cm in length, and {{differ from the}} adults in that they have two reddish-white stripes along their belly, and are often red. Because of the distinct difference in coloration between juveniles and adults, they were considered separate species for a long time. Its head spines are exceptionally strong. They grow to a maximum length of 36 in and are typically found in the 28 to 215 fathom m range, although specimen have been reported up to a maximum depth of 260 fathom m.|$|R

50|$|The P.111 was {{designed}} as the smallest airframe which could couple an engine (Rolls-Royce Nene), an ejection seat (Martin-Baker), and a delta wing. The latter was aerodynamically thin and had a sweep angle of 45°. Without tip extensions the wing was strongly cropped at about 75% of the full delta. The aircraft could be flown with these wings or with one of two pairs of extensions, the larger ones making an almost perfect pointed delta shape. These extensions allowed {{an investigation of the}} aerodynamic effects of the tip shapes of delta wings. Unlike its contemporary the Avro 707, roll and attitude were both controlled by a pair of elevons. The fin had an unswept trailing edge and its tip also could be removed and altered, though it seems it always flew with a very pointed tip. The P.111 was fitted with one of the first fully powered control systems, hydraulically driven with electrical trim tabs. Because the Nene had a centrifugal compressor, the P.111 had a rather tubby fuselage, with an oval nose intake. The inward-retracting undercarriage had a noticeably wide track and a tall nosewheel leg placed it at 17° on the ground. The construction was all-metal {{with the exception of the}} wing extensions and the <b>fin</b> <b>tip,</b> which were of glass-reinforced plastic.|$|E
40|$|The Dutch artist M. C. Escher {{created his}} four “Circle Limit ” {{patterns}} which used the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry. Many people consider {{the third one}} of this sequence, Circle Limit III — a pattern of fish, {{to be the most}} beautiful. In this woodcut, four fish meet at right <b>fin</b> <b>tips,</b> three fish meet at left <b>fin</b> <b>tips,</b> and three fish meet at their noses. The backbones of the fish are aligned along white circular arcs. Fish on one arc are the same color, and all fish are colored according to the map-coloring principal: adjacent fish must have different colors. We generalize Escher’s Circle Limit III pattern to an entire family of fish patterns. A pattern of fish in this family will have p fish meeting at right fins, q fish meeting at left fins, and r fish meeting at their noses meet. The number r must be odd so that the fish swim head to tail along backbone arcs. We denote such a pattern by the triple (p,q,r). Circle Limit III would be labeled (4, 3, 3) in this system. The pattern will be hyperbolic or Euclidean depending on whether 1 /p + 1 /q + 1 /r is {{less than or equal to}} 1. Escher himself created a Euclidean pattern in this family — Notebook drawing 123, which we denote (3, 3, 3). Our Math Awareness Month 2003 poster pattern would be denoted (5, 3, 3). We will show more patterns of this family. 1...|$|R
