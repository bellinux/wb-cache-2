40|$|Thesis (MEd (Computer Science Education)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Professional {{development}} of teachers is a much-investigated area of research; however, teachers still complain that these endeavours do not cater for their specific needs. This problem arises from teachers‟ {{need to have}} more frequent professional development activities whereby {{it is possible to}} enhance their knowledge and skills regarding specific areas effectively. Multimedia, in other words the use of various media such as video, pictures, narration and animation, is a possible tool to address certain needs in professional development. Furthermore, the incorporation of multimedia into professional development by making use of a <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>disc</b> allows for professional development to occur within a distance mode of delivery setting. This research was done to investigate and understand how Information Technology teachers experience the incorporation of multimedia into professional development by means of <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>disc.</b> In order to accomplish this research endeavour, an investigation into the body of scholarly knowledge was executed focused on professional {{development of}} teachers, specifically with regard to needs expressed in previous studies.

The system requirements of the DVD and the related channel coding are outlined in this paper. The compact disc (CD), introduced more than a decade ago, is a very successful medium for the distribution and storage of digital audio and other digital information. It is anticipated that its storage capacity, 680 Mbytes, will be insufficient for future graphicsintensive computer applications and high-quality digital video programs. An extension of the compact disc family, the <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>DVD),</b> is a new opt,ical recording medium with a storage capacity seven times higher than the conventional CD. From a consumer vantage point, DVDs will be capable of storing highdefinition video/audio for featurelength movies and are expected to graduaIly replace videocassette tape and CD-ROM computer data disks once DVD becomes accepted as a commercial product. The DVD format will support a variety of uses. There will be at least two types of products introduced in; 1996 : the DVD movie player and the DVD-ROM. An audioonly version of the DVD is still under development. The single-layer disc can hold 4. 7 Gbytes, which amounts to seven times more data than an audio CD.

40|$|Abstract: The visual {{aspect of}} {{classroom}} culture {{is becoming more}} important because students now have much greater access to the means of producing, viewing and manipulating images. Using a framework adapted from Foucault and taking a myth-making position, this paper puts forward six propositions as means of explaining how images in the classroom might be read. Theory relating to this emerging literacy is further explained through reference to three dominant classroom narratives. It is argued that the interesting elements of an image are often those that link the classroom metanarratives to wider, hegemonic concerns. Interesting research directions are proposed throughout the paper. The visual has risen steadily in importance in our culture. The presence of visual images has progressed from the high art of the painting through various media such as still photographs, broadcast free and pay television, VHS video, video games, <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>DVD)</b> and Blue Ray ® until {{it is now a}} commonplace attribute of popular culture.
