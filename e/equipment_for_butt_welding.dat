40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to argue whether the {{certification}} process used in Finland <b>for</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> products is sufficient for ensuring quality welds.

An as-cold-rolled sheet steel with the chemical composition of (0. 1 – 0. 3) C– 1. 5 Si– 1. 5 Mn (mass%) was used in this study. For comparison, 0. 14 C– 0. 22 Si– 1. 78 Mn (mass%) DP steel was also prepared. The quenched DP steel is called MDP 0, and the tempered MDP 0 steel is called MDP 4. <b>For</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding,</b> the blank obtained after the heat treatment was cut using a fine cutter, and YAG laser processing equipment was used.

40|$|Precise {{positioning}} of the laser beam on the work piece is crucial for high quality laser welds; e. g. <b>for</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{the focal point of}} the laser beam with respect to the joint must be maintained within an accuracy better than 20 m - 150 m, depending on the focused beam radius. These stringent accuracy requirements call for high precision robots, a repeatable work piece profile and precise clamping. To compensate for insufficient repeatability of work piece or clamping, seam-tracking devices are used. A sensor measures the joint position and computes a correction vector to follow the actual joint trajectory. The deviation is compensated either by robot trajectory adjustment or by an additional tracking axis. Disadvantages of this approach are complex installation of the devices due to interfacing with the robot control, the need of teaching and calibrating the sensor and principle based accuracy restriction that limit the usability in more complex 2 d contours and with l ow accuracy robots. We recently introduced a more flexible and precise approach that utilizes an advanced camera-based sensor that is capable of measuring seam position, relative displacement between work piece and sensor and melt pool of the process with one single device.
