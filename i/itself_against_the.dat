25|$|Unlike other left groups, the SPGB {{did not see}} fascism as {{a special}} threat to the working class. Rather than formulating it as the last refuge of {{capitalism}} organising to defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> working class, the party’s writers and speakers tended to {{view it as a}} particular type of reform movement. The two specific characteristics identified, though, were that it tended to be a form of national consolidation – unifying fragment nations such as Germany, Italy and Spain – and that it tended to have the mass support of the working class.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{speed and}} {{operating}} altitude of the Valkyrie was considered sufficient protection against Soviet interceptors of the time. However it was anticipated that future aircraft and missile developments {{would reduce the}} B-70's margin of superiority, especially following the SA-2 Guideline SAM being displayed during the 1957 May Day parade. Intelligence reports indicated that SAMs were being deployed in large numbers throughout Russia, and it was believed the SA-2 was capable of being fitted with a nuclear warhead. Therefore, {{it was decided that}} the B-70 would need an interceptor missile to defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> perceived threat.|$|E

25|$|The British interceded {{to prevent}} more French {{expansion}} against Siam, but their price, in 1909 was {{the acceptance of}} British sovereignty over Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu, under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. All of these ceded territories were {{on the fringes of}} the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under Siamese control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. In the early 20th century these crises were adopted by the increasingly nationalist government as symbols of the need for the country to assert <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> West and its neighbours.|$|E
25|$|Luftflotte 2 {{carefully}} timed {{fighter and}} bomber sweeps throughout 25 July to exhaust the RAF standing patrols. Once British fighter opposition had spent <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Bf109s, large bomber formations could attack the convoys before reinforcements arrived. At noon, 65 Squadron was in action with JG 52, the Germans losing one fighter and its pilot for no {{loss to the}} British. Nine 32 Squadron Hurricanes and 11 from 615 Squadron engaged more than 40 Bf109s in a dogfight near Dover and one Hurricane was badly damaged. As the battle receded, Ju87s from 11.(Stuka)/LG 1 and III./StG 1 attacked the convoy. Distress calls from the ships were answered by 54 Squadron which sent nine Spitfires but Bf109 fighters (unit unknown) shot down two Spitfires for no loss.|$|E
25|$|Instead of the tunnel, ferry {{service was}} inaugurated across the narrow Western Gap channel {{in the spring}} of 1939. The first ferry service was a cable ferry, which was rated to carry 48 persons. The cable ferry was {{constructed}} by the Harbour Commission at its yard at the Keating Channel. It was attached by two cables, one to either dock. One cable was reeled in, while the other was let out. The cable was dropped to the bottom to let shipping pass. When high waves occurred from storms or wind, the ferry went out of service. Attached by a rope, the ferry was allowed to drift out into the channel to avoid battering <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> dock. The boat was 'marooned' for two days when the Hurricane Hazel storm arrived in 1954.|$|E

25|$|Stewart's 12th Brigade {{could muster}} {{no more than}} 430 {{officers}} and men, with 94 officers and men from the Argylls. Selby's brigade was slightly better off with 750 answering roll call the next day. In all the 11th Division lost an estimated 3,200 troops and {{a large amount of}} irreplaceable equipment. The Japanese had managed to attack through a division along nineteen miles and take two bridges at minimal cost to themselves all before lunch time. General Wavell, after meeting survivors of the battle, was appalled by the condition they were in and ordered the 11th Indian Division out of the front line. This defeat for the British allowed the Japanese to take Kuala Lumpur unopposed, Wavell ordered Percival to retreat into southern Malaya, giving up central Malaya, and then to allow the Australian 8th Division an opportunity to prove <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Army.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is a schooling {{species as}} a juvenile, transitioning {{to a more}} solitary fish with well defined home ranges as an adult. Adults do school to form spawning aggregations or temporarily while hunting, with evidence from laboratory studies indicates bluefin trevally are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae {{and to a lesser}} extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The number of fish present in an area is also influenced by tidal factors and possibly the abundance of prey and other environmental factors. Tracking studies in Hawaii have found bluefin trevally patrol back and forth along a home range of patch reef walls during the day, only stopping for variable periods where major depth changes or discontinuities in the reef were present. Several fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do. While most fish patrol the one reef, some have been observed to make excursions to nearby reefs, before returning to their home reef later. Night time movements are less extensive than daytime movements, with the trevally moving rapidly between several small reef sections, before slowing down and milling in one patch for around an hour. The fish living in a particular region congregate in one area at night, before returning to their individual daytime range during the day. The reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species. Long term studies have found the fish may range up to 10.2km over several months, however is much less restricted in its movements than its relative, the giant trevally. A Hawaiian biomass study found the species to be one of the most abundant large predators in the islands, however it is less abundant in the heavily exploited Main Hawaiian Islands compared to the remote Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The main difference in these populations was the relative lack of large adult fish in the inhabited areas compared to the remote, unfished regions. A study on carangids caught during a fishing tournament in Hawaii found the bluefin trevally is the most common trevally species taken, accounting for over 80% of the carangid catch. The authors note that this may not only reflect its abundance, but also it vulnerability to specific fishing methods used in the tournament. Apart from the typical predator-prey relationship the species shows (described later), an individual of the species has been seen to rub <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> skin of a Galapagos shark, apparently to rid itself of parasites. This behaviour is also observed in rainbow runner and is a rare example of a commensal cleaner relationship where the cleaner does not gain anything.|$|E
500|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} (Eucrossorhinus dasypogon) is {{a species of}} carpet shark in the family Orectolobidae and {{the only member of}} its genus. It inhabits shallow coral reefs off northern Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent islands. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a broad and flattened body and head. Its most distinctive trait is a fringe of branching dermal flaps around its head, which extends onto its chin. The fringe, along with its complex color pattern of small blotches and reticulations, enable it to camouflage <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> reef environment.|$|E

500|$|On 30 July, the RSK {{declared}} a state of war and the RSK President Milan Martić stated that the Croatian territorial gains would soon be reversed in cooperation with the VRS. VRS Supreme Commander Colonel General Ratko Mladić visited Knin the same day, also promising to restore the territory lost that month. However, the RSK military concluded that the VRS had no units in western Bosnia capable of the attack. Analyses of the RSK military showed that the HV had saved the Bihać pocket for the second time and that it was preparing to attack the RSK at several points. Following the offensive, the RSK authorities reported fear and panic among the population caused by the conviction that the RSK could not defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> HV. [...] On 2 August, the RSK civil defence authorities ordered preparation for evacuation of the RSK, and the RSK prime minister Milan Babić asked the government ministers to prepare to move to Donji Lapac. Women and children started to evacuate to FR Yugoslavia, while a mobilization of the RSK military was largely completed by 3 August.|$|E
500|$|According to the biographical {{dictionary}} {{compiled by}} Ibn Khallikan, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{was born in}} Baghdad on 8 February 882, on the street leading to the Kufa Gate. His family was of Turkic origin from the Farghana Valley in Transoxiana, and claimed royal descent; {{the name of his}} ancestor, [...] "Khaqan", is a Turkic royal title. Muhammad's grandfather Juff left Farghana to enter military service in the Abbasid court at Samarra, as did the father of Ibn Tulun, the founder of the Tulunid dynasty. Juff and his son, Muhammad's father Tughj, both served the Abbasids, but Tughj later entered the service of the Tulunids, who since 868 had become autonomous rulers of Egypt and Syria. Tughj served the Tulunids as governor of Tiberias (capital of the district of Jordan), Aleppo (the capital of the district of Qinnasrin) and Damascus (capital of the homonymous district). He {{played a major role in}} repelling the Qarmatian attack on Damascus in 903; although defeated in battle, he held the city <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Qarmatians for seven months until, with the arrival of reinforcements from Egypt, the Qarmatians were driven away. Thus Muhammad ibn Tughj spent a great part of his youth in the Tulunid Levant at his father's side, gaining his first experiences in administration—he served as his father's sub-governor of Tiberias—and war.|$|E
