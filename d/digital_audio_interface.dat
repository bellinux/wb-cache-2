25|$|Both the HD and SD serial {{interfaces}} provide for 16 channels of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the SMPTE 272M standard, whereas HD uses the SMPTE 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>interface.</b> These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|E

The game port has been supplanted in the modern PC by USB devices, and so typically a PC owner will need to purchase a MIDI interface that attaches to the USB or FireWire port of their machine to use MIDI.

50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Interface</b> (DAI) was the input/output {{path between}} the Digital Editing System and {{external}} hardware. The DAI received raw source data from session tapes {{and passed the}} data on to the editing system's computer for storage. Finished (edited) data passed through the DAI from the editing system's computer to a DTR for creation of a master tape. During the editing process, data from the editing system's computer passed through the DAI to a Digital Audio Conversion Unit (DAC Box) in the editing room.|$|E
50|$|So {{that users}} of the 3M Digital Mastering System could take {{advantage}} of Soundstream's editing system, the company developed the M Adapter. The adapter was a bidirectional eight-channel format converter. Data from the 3M Digital Mastering System were converted to the format used by the Soundstream DTR so that the data appearing at the input to the <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Interface</b> looked to the DAI as if it had come from a DTR. Similarly, finished (edited) data in Soundstream format were restored to the 3M format by the adapter.|$|E

50|$|Multichannel <b>Audio</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MADI) or AES10 is an Audio Engineering Society (AES) {{standard}} electronic {{communications protocol}} {{that defines the}} data format and electrical characteristics of an interface that carries multiple channels of <b>digital</b> <b>audio.</b> The AES first documented the MADI standard in AES10-1991, and updated it in AES10-2003 and AES10-2008. The MADI standard includes a bit-level description and has features {{in common with the}} two-channel format of AES3. It supports serial digital transmission over coaxial cable or fibre-optic lines of 28, 56, or 64 channels; and sampling rates of up to 96 kHz with an audio bit depth of up to 24 bits per channel. Like AES3 and ADAT it is a unidirectional interface from one sender to one receiver.|$|R

50|$|So {{that users}} of the Sony PCM-1610 Digital Audio Processor could take {{advantage}} of Soundstream's editing system, the company developed the S-1610 Adapter. The adapter was a bidirectional two-channel format converter. Data from the Sony PCM-1610 were converted to the format used by the Soundstream DTR so that the data appearing at the input to the <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Interface</b> looked to the DAI as if it had come from a DTR. Similarly, finished (edited) data in Soundstream format were restored to the Sony format by the adapter. Sony data were imported/exported at either of the two sample rates 44.1 kHz or 44.1/1.001 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, many {{performers}} have recorded music using only a PC as a tracking machine. The computer {{must have a}} sound card or other type of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>interface</b> {{with one or more}} Analog-to-digital converters. Multitrack recording software must be installed on the computer. Microphones are needed to record the sounds of vocalists or acoustic instruments. Depending on the capabilities of the system, some instruments, such as a synthesizer or electric guitar, can also be sent to an interface directly using Line level or MIDI inputs. Direct inputs eliminate the need for microphones and can provide another range of sound control options.|$|E
25|$|Although {{widely known}} for its {{analogue}} technology, SSL {{was one of the}} <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> pioneers and put together an impressive team of digital engineers under the leadership of Peter Eastty. The team defected en masse to become Oxford Digital (subsequently Sony Oxford) and SSL had to start over. Recognising the importance of digital interface standardisation {{to the future of the}} industry, SSL partnered with Sony and Studer to develop the now widespread MADI (Multichannel <b>Audio</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface)</b> protocol. The new team, led by Phil Hill, developed an eight channel editor, ScreenSound, followed by workstations, Scenaria and OmniMix; all targeted at the post-production market. This technology formed the basis of SSL 'A Series' consoles starting with Axiom and followed by Aysis, Avant, Aysis Air and Axiom MT. These consoles offered knob per function type control surfaces that were familiar to a generation of engineers who had grown up with SSL's analogue consoles.|$|R

50|$|There are {{tremendous}} {{differences in}} computer <b>audio</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Such units vary widely in price, sound quality, and flexibility. The most basic <b>interfaces</b> use <b>audio</b> circuitry that {{is built into}} the computer motherboard.

Professional interfaces usually use one or more IEEE 1394 (commonly known as FireWire) connections. Other types of interfaces may use internal PCI cards, or external USB connections. Popular manufacturers of high quality interfaces include Apogee Electronics, Avid Audio (formerly Digidesign), Echo <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio,</b> Focusrite, MOTU, RME Audio, M-Audio and PreSonus.|$|R

50|$|McASP is {{an acronym}} for Multichannel Audio Serial Port, a {{communication}} peripheral found in Texas Instruments family of digital signal processors (DSPs) and Microcontroller Units (MCUs).The McASP functions as a general-purpose audio serial port optimized {{for the needs of}} multichannel audio applications.Depending on the implementation, the McASP may be useful for time-division multiplexed (TDM) stream, Inter-Integrated Sound (I2S) protocols, and intercomponent <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>interface</b> transmission (DIT). However, some implementations are limited to supporting just the Inter-Integrated Sound (I2S) protocol.The McASP consists of transmit and receive sections that may operate synchronized,or completely independently with separate master clocks, bit clocks, and frame syncs,and using different transmit modes with different bit-stream formats. The McASPmodule also includes up to 16 serializers that can be individually enabled to eithertransmit or receive. In addition, all of the McASP pins can be configured asgeneral-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins.|$|E
50|$|For {{the audio}} and sound {{engineering}} on the tour, DiGiCo SD7 consoles {{were used by}} mixing specialists Andy Meyer and monitor engineers Matt Napier and Sean Spuehler. Since Madonna wanted to have an authentic feel with the live sound, Spuehler mixed her vocal effects and then added it to the house consoles. During {{the duration of the}} concert, the singer ventures {{into the middle of the}} crowd as the runway approaches, resulting in the spill of the microphone in her hand constantly changing. The sound crew employed timecode to achieve this, whereby like the lighting and the choreography, the sound feed also changed depending on where the singer was onstage. All the musicians accompanying Madonna wore in-ear monitor, with additional monitoring for musical director/keyboardist Kevin Antunes, a thumper for drummer Brian Frasier-Moore and sidefills for the dancers. All the inputs from the different personnel including Madonna were fed into the SD7 console. A Multichannel <b>Audio</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MADI) was used to record all the shows to a <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> workstation in RAID drives. They were archived into four terabyte backup disks.|$|R
