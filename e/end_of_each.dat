5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E

These segments illustrate the events that occur during Takaaki's commute to school, during school, after school, and after he returns home at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> day. Depending {{on the time of}} the day and the player's actions, he or she may be presented one of three types of events: mandatory events, which occur automatically during certain points in the game's plot line; temporary events, which occur during certain periods of time only if specific conditions are met; or after school events, which occur at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> school day.|$|E

50|$|A torsion-bar antenna (or TOBA) {{is a novel}} {{scheme for}} a {{gravitational}} wave detector, proposed by M. Ando, et al. in 2010. The proposed design is composed of two, long, thin bars, suspended as torsion pendula in a cross-like fashion. Their differential angle (sensitive to tidal gravitational wave forces) would be compared using a set of optical cavities with one <b>end</b> mirror <b>of</b> <b>each</b> cavity fixed to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> bar. Such a detector could be fashioned either for ground-based or space-based use.|$|R
25|$|There can be many {{variations}} on the shell and tube design. Typically, the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes.|$|R
