For instance, {{addition of}} the plural suffix /-ǝn / to Dutch nouns causes vowel lengthening in some nouns due to the weight-to-stress principle ([xɑt] vs. [xáː. tǝn] ‘hole’). These kinds of processes often apply only to a subset of words – not all Dutch nouns undergo this process ([kɑt] vs. [kɑ. tǝn] ‘cat’). Nouns need to be lexically indexed as either undergoing this process or not. I investigate how phonological grammar and lexical indexation are learned when learners are confronted with data like these. Based on learnability considerations, I hypothesize that learners acquire a grammar with default non-alternation, so that novel items are treated as non-alternating. I report the results of artificial language learning experiments compatible with this hypothesis, and model these results in {{a version of the}} Biased Constraint Demotion Algorithm (Prince and Tesar 2004). *This research has been presented at the Phonology Discussion group at the University of Michigan, and at the <b>ExpOT</b> conference held at the University of Michigan in 2007. My appreciation to these audiences for supporting, even if challenging, discussion. Particularly helpful have been discussions with Pam Beddor, Iris Berent, and Joe Pater. Also a word of appreciation to my fellow guest-editors for this volume (René Kager and Joe Pater), and to two anonymous reviewers for their thorough review of this research.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict crop growth of year-round cut {{chrysanthemum}} (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) based on an empirical model of potential crop growth rate as a function of daily incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, MJ m¿ 2 d¿ 1), using generalized estimated parameters of the expolinear growth equation. For development of the model, chrysanthemum crops were grown in four experiments at different plant densities (32, 48, 64 and 80 plants m¿ 2), during different seasons (planting in January, May¿June and September) and under different light regimes [natural light, shading to 66 and 43 % of natural light, and supplementary assimilation light (ASS, 40 ¿ 48 µmol m¿ 2 s¿ 1) ]. The expolinear growth equation as a function of time (<b>EXPOT)</b> or as a function of incident PAR integral (EXPOPAR) effectively described periodically measured total dry mass of shoot (R 2 > 0 · 98). However, growth parameter estimates for the fitted EXPOPAR were more suitable as they were not correlated to each other. Coefficients of EXPOPAR characterized the relative growth rate per incident PAR integral [rm,i (MJ m¿ 2) ¿ 1] and light use efficiency (LUE, g MJ¿ 1) at closed canopy. In all four experiments, no interaction effects between treatments on crop growth parameters were found. rm,i and LUE were not different between ASS and natural light treatments, but were increased significantly when light levels were reduced by shading in the summer experiments. There was no consistent effect of plant density on growth parameters. rm,i and LUE showed hyperbolic relationships to average daily incident PAR averaged over 10 -d periods after planting (rm,i) or before final harvest (LUE). Based on those relationships, maximum relative growth rate (rm, g g¿ 1 d¿ 1) and maximum crop growth rate (cm, g m¿ 2 d¿ 1) were described successfully by rectangular hyperbolic relationships to daily incident PAR. In model validation, total dry mass of shoot (Wshoot, g m¿ 2) simulated over time was in good agreement with measured ones in three independent experiments, using daily incident PAR and leaf area index as inputs. Based on these results, it is concluded that the expolinear growth equation is a useful tool for quantifying cut chrysanthemum growth parameters and comparing growth parameter values between different treatments, especially when light is the growth-limiting factor. Under controlled environmental conditions the regression model worked satisfactorily, hence the model may be applied as a simple tool for understanding crop growth behaviour under seasonal variation in daily light integral, and for planning cropping systems of year-round cut chrysanthemum. However, further research on leaf area development in cut chrysanthemum is required to advance chrysanthemum crop growth predictio...|$|E

40|$|The article {{attempts}} at {{the estimation of}} foreign trade development in the Poznan district economy. The need to elaborate the local balance of trade turnover in domestic and exchange prices is indicated at, in order to estimate the input of enterprises of that region in the exchange balance of trade of the national economy. Analysis {{of the development of}} export production in the years 1981 - 1983 : indicates the gradual reconstruction of the export dynamics. Nevertheless the structural underdevelopment of foreign trade in the Poznan district can be observed, it is manifested by the high share of traditional products in export (products of agriculture, forestry etc.). On the grounds of the empirical analysis of profitability of the export production of the Poznan district, the author reaches a conclusion that the financial situation of numerous exporting enterprises is not optimistic. Several branches of economy of the region, as well as industries in a given period, were not able to cover all costs related to export incomes which has contributed to the increase of losses of the <b>expoting</b> enterprises. The author maintains that initiation of the development of specialized industries can be in a long run, a prerequisite to improve the product structure of the foreign trade of the Poznan district.
