5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively <b>hard-wired</b> into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E

25|$|The {{risk of the}} diver {{getting lost}} or being unable to call for {{assistance}} is also drastically reduced in comparison with most scuba, as the diver is physically connected to the surface control point by the umbilical, making it relatively simple for the standby diver {{to get to a}} diver in distress, and the standard application of <b>hard-wired</b> voice communications allows the surface team to constantly monitor the diver's breathing sounds.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{orders were}} <b>hard-wired</b> {{on a set}} of uniselector {{switches}} and loaded into the low words of memory at startup. By May 1949, the initial orders provided a primitive relocating assembler taking advantage of the mnemonic design described above, all in 31 words.

There is a simulation of EDSAC available and a full description of the initial orders and first programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{competitive}} edge for Dorsey's Micom 2000 was that, {{unlike many other}} machines, it was truly programmable. The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a <b>hard-wired</b> system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable. The Micom 2000 {{was said to be}} a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented some pretty serious competition such as IBM, Xerox and Wang Laboratories.|$|E
50|$|The PROFIenergy {{switching}} mechanisms reside inside energy consumers. No additional <b>hard-wiring</b> is required. The controlling device transmits signals via PROFINET to {{say when}} production pauses will happen. These can be at known times, or in response to random conditions e.g. breakdowns. Each unit then decides how this information is to be handled.|$|R
25|$|Digital {{electronics}} helped too. Former analogue-based instrumentation {{was replaced}} by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization and operation. This was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating <b>hard-wiring.</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{very early}} {{versions}} of DOS {{to recognize the}} file system, the system must have been booted from the volume or the volume's FAT must start with the volume's second sector (logical sector 1 with physical CHS address 0/0/2 or LBA address 1), that is, immediately following the boot sector.

25|$|The {{controllers}} were <b>hard-wired</b> to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied {{directly from the}} Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even taking apart ones from American game consoles {{to see how they}} worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port {{on the front of the}} console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>hard-wired</b> (cable) and through-water {{electronic}} voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not make the system any different to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E

25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or <b>hard-wired</b> unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) {{provided}} {{the first evidence}} for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive {{part of the brain}} that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, <b>hard-wired</b> and pleasurable. One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy. The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.|$|E
25|$|MIFARE Classic chips, {{on which}} the {{original}} Oyster card was based, are <b>hard-wired</b> logic smartcards, meaning that they have limited computing power designed for a specific task. The MIFARE DESFire chips used on the new Oyster card are CPUs with much more sophisticated security features and more complex computation power. They are activated only {{when they are in}} an electromagnetic field compatible with ISO/IEC 14443 type A, provided by Oyster readers. The readers read information from the cards, calculate whether to allow travel, assess any fare payable and write back information to the card. Some basic information about the MIFARE Classic or MIFARE DESFire chip can be read by any ISO/IEC 14443 type A compatible reader, but Oyster-specific information cannot be read without access to the encryption used for the Oyster system. While {{it has been suggested that}} a good reader could read personal details from a distance, there has been no evidence of anyone being able to decrypt Oyster information. By design the cards do not carry any personal information. Aluminium shielding has been suggested to prevent any personal data from being read.|$|E

40|$|The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 is a {{standard}} that allows communication integration of systems built from multivendor power protection relays. The standard describes the rules for integration of control, measurement, and protection functions within a power system network at the substation control levels. The standard was created {{with the idea of}} eliminating wiring in the substation and facilitating the communication between different relay vendors. This study implemented IEC 61850 standard in a Permissive Overreach Transfer Trip (POTT) scheme to protect a 166 mile, 230 kV transmission line using Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging in the laboratory. Two multivendor digital line protection relays were placed {{at each end of the}} line to protect the transmission line via the POTT communication scheme. Faults were simulated at different points on the line using two modern relay test sets. A comparison of the POTT with IEC 61850 communication and a classic communication method, <b>hard-wire,</b> is made to determine the performance of the POTT with IEC 61850. It is observed that the maximum and minimum time delay between fault occurrence and the POTT operation with IEC 61850 communication is around 1. 72 cycles (28. 67 ms) and 1. 50 cycles (25 ms), respectively, under laboratory conditions.
