This research focused {{on the influence of}} leadership, organisational values and organisational change on employee engagement within a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The construct leadership was further examined using two hierarchical levels, <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line manager and <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders to deepen the understanding of the influence these levels of leadership have on employee engagement A quantitative research approach was followed wherein a non-random convenience sample (N = 969) of permanent staff operating within the Retail Operations Specialities function of South Africa s largest non-food retailer participated in the study. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength {{of the relationship between the}} dependent (employee engagement) and independent variables for each research question. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to analyse the differences among group means and their associated procedures. <b>Employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders were found to have a stronger influence on <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> engagement levels in comparison to <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line managers. In addition the study found that the application of organisational values have a positive influence on employee engagement whilst organisational change was found to have the strongest influence on employee engagement explaining 41. 2 % of the variance in employee engagement.
