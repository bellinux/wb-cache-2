25|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, Barker {{operated}} with the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) in Southeast Asian and Australian waters until May 1942, then escorted convoys between San Francisco, California, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii until May 1943, when the destroyer {{transferred to the}} Atlantic Fleet to join Task Group 21.12, a <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>group</b> centered on the escort carrier Core.|$|E
25|$|For over a week, fishing junks, sailing junks, and {{floating}} naval mines provided the only contacts. On 24February, she sighted a large tanker with four escorts but lost the convoy. On 25February, she sighted and evaded a Japanese <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>group.</b> On 29February, she sank or exploded four mines {{and attempted to}} do the same to two others.|$|E
25|$|Kidd again got {{underway}} for Korea 8 September 1952; {{joined the}} screen of a <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>group</b> near Kojo; and, in November, was back on bombardment missions off North Korea. Shortly thereafter, truce talks began. Kidd continued to patrol the Korean coast during negotiations. She departed the Far East 3 March 1953 via Midway and Pearl Harbor and arrived San Diego for overhaul 20 March.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, the <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>group</b> {{headed for}} the Yellow Sea. On 7 January 1945, Spot sank two small {{trawlers}} with her deck gun. Four days later, she destroyed a small freighter by gunfire. On 13 January off Shanghai, the submarine sank two trawlers by shellfire, and she repeated the feat the next day. In a night sweep through the Elliott Islands on 18 and 19 January, Spot torpedoed a cargo ship and a tanker.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{returned}} to the east coast in September 1954 and resumed her normal operations. In December, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier. On 10 January 1955, while still undergoing conversion, she was redesignated CVS-40. Her alterations were completed that summer and, after shakedown, the carrier operated around Quonset Point, Rhode Island, conducting training missions with the ASW air squadrons based there. That fall, she participated in exercises with <b>Hunter-Killer</b> <b>Group</b> 4 before returning to Quonset Point {{to prepare for the}} 1956 Springboard exercise.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April, {{the convoy}} {{encountered}} U-548, which {{was attacked by}} the USS Natchez. The convoy and the other escorts, including the PC-1264 continued on course with the USS Natchez remaining to deal with U-548. Later that night the convoy encountered Task Group 02.10, a <b>Hunter-Killer</b> <b>Group,</b> which passed down the port side of the convoy on its way assist the USS Natchez. Two of the destroyer escorts in this group participated {{in the destruction of}} U-548, one of the last anti-submarine actions of the war in the Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|As the Battle of the Atlantic wore on, British and Commonwealth forces became {{particularly}} {{adept at}} depth charge tactics, and formed {{some of the}} first destroyer <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> to actively seek out and destroy German U-boats.|$|R
50|$|In the Battle of the Atlantic, escort {{carriers}} {{were used}} to protect convoys against U-boats. Initially escort carriers accompanied the merchant ships and helped to fend off attacks from aircraft and submarines. As numbers increased later in the war, escort carriers also formed part of <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> that sought out submarines instead of being attached to a particular convoy.|$|R
5000|$|Once America {{joined the}} war, the {{different}} tactics were complementary, both suppressing {{the effectiveness of}} and destroying U-boats. The increase in Allied naval strength allowed both convoy defense and <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> to be deployed, and this {{was reflected in the}} massive increase in U-boat kills {{in the latter part of}} the war. The British developments of centimetric radar and the Leigh Light, as well as increased numbers of escorts, reached the point of being able to support U-boat hunting towards the end of the war, while earlier on, the advantage was definitely on the side of the submarine. Commanders such as F. J. [...] "Johnnie" [...] Walker of the Royal Navy were able to develop integrated tactics which made the deployment of <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> a practical proposition. Walker developed a creeping attack technique, where one destroyer would track the U-boat while another attacked. Often U-boats would turn and increase speed to spoil the depth charge attack, as the escort would lose sonar contact as it steamed over the submarine. With the new tactic, one escort vessel would attack while another would track the target. Any course or depth change could be relayed to the attacking destroyer. Once a U-boat was caught, it was very difficult to escape. Since <b>Hunter-Killer</b> <b>groups</b> were not limited to convoy escort, they could continue an attack until a U-Boat was destroyed or had to surface from damage or lack of air.|$|R
500|$|USNS Card was a [...] {{that had}} served in the United States Navy with distinction. The Cards hull was laid down on October 27, 1941; {{originally}} intended as a cargo ship, the ship was reclassified ACV-11 and converted into an escort carrier with a displacement of 9,800 tons. On July 15, 1943, Card was reclassified CVE-11 and became the flagship of Task Group 21.14 (TG 21.14), a <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>group</b> formed to destroy German submarines in the North Atlantic. During the periods between July and November, Cards aircraft and the escort vessels of TG 21.14 destroyed a total of five German submarines. On November 11, 1943, Card and her escort destroyers were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their success as part of TG21.14, and Card became the first escort carrier to receive such an award for combating German submarines. By the end of World War II, Card and her aircraft destroyed a total of 11 German submarines, which made it the second most successful ship of its class.|$|E

On the morning of 6 May, the destroyer escort [...] found the submarine. After an exchange of gunfire and torpedoes, Buckley, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Brent Abel, rammed the submarine.|$|E

The submarine surfaced and fired her deck gun at her pursuers as she dashed away at flank speed. The remainder of the patrol was devoted to attacking patrol craft and coastal vessels with gunfire until it ended at Midway on 16 June.|$|E

However, the failed attack on Ark Royal, and the successful attack on Courageous on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> were abandoned.|$|R

Although some controversy surrounds credit for the sinking, naval authorities determined that Natal had sunk U-714 with the loss of the submarine's entire crew of 50 men and gave Natal sole credit.|$|E
2500|$|The U-boat left Lorient on 14 May 1944 {{and sailed}} to the waters north-west of the Canary Islands.

Escort carriers were typically smaller, shorter, slower, cheaper, and more quickly built than fleet carriers, and also carried fewer planes. They however made huge contributions to winning the war through escorting convoys, providing air support to ground troops, transporting aircraft, and forming the core of <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> which sought out and sank enemy submarines.|$|R

50|$|Larger {{numbers of}} escorts became available, {{both as a}} result of American {{building}} programmes and the release of escorts committed to the North African landings during November and December 1942. In particular, destroyer escorts (similar British ships were known as frigates) were designed, which could be built more economically than expensive fleet destroyers and were more seaworthy than corvettes. There would not only be sufficient numbers of escorts to securely protect convoys, they could also form <b>hunter-killer</b> <b>groups</b> (often centred on escort carriers) to aggressively hunt U-boats.|$|R
