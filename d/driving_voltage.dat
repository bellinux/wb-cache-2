The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a <b>driving</b> <b>voltage,</b> which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} for specifying the waveforms of <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> for a Piezo LEGS motor. A novel idea of coordinate transformation to define the waveforms of <b>driving</b> <b>voltages,</b> based on the motor static model, is presented. This transformation defines <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> according to the desired motion of the motor legs in the x- and y-directions. The approach allows a user to first define force acting on the motor rod in the y-direction and define the rod's x-direction trajectory profile. Waveforms of the <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> are subsequently defined to meet these requirements. The proposed approach also enables the possibility of defining the desired step shape for the motor and, according to that definition, producing <b>driving</b> <b>voltages.</b> Based on the given coordinate transformation, a simple method for Piezo LEGS motor control, identified as virtual time control, is presented. This method results in overshoot-free high precision positioning...|$|R

When the bias is negative the domain contracts giving a negative deflection as measured by the photodiode meaning that the piezoresponse will always be in-phase with the <b>driving</b> <b>voltage.</b> For anti-alignment of electric field and polarisation orientation (bottom right) a positive bias results in a contraction of the domain and so gives a negative deflection as measured by the photodiode therefore the piezoresponse is 180° out-of-phase with the <b>driving</b> <b>voltage.</b> In this way the orientation of polarisation within a domain can be observed.|$|E

The sensitivity of the latter to mechanical bending makes the wire a tunable nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) weak link between reservoirs.

40|$|The {{electrophoretic display}} (EPD) {{technology}} has {{great potential for}} use in small sized, low power portable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Due to its capability of true bistability and reflectivity, it can show static images in ambient light without the need of any flowing current. The required power for image updates {{is found to be}} highly dependent on the image pattern and driving circuitry architecture. If the driving circuitry is designed specifically for low power consumption and occasional image update, small size EPDs can potentially be integrated in products that never before had the opportunity of an integrated display. Based on a theoretical and practical analysis of the EPD and its driving circuitry, trade-offs and power-reduction techniques are highlighted in this thesis. The the- oretical analysis is approached by dividing the driving circuitry into smaller sub- circuits or common building blocks. Each block is thereafter broken down and analyzed individually. A conceptual low power EPD module is then presented at higher abstraction levels. The practical experiments and analysis is based on a commercially available small size EPD. Different image updating techniques and driving pulse lengths are tested to find the optimal optical performance with min- imum energy consumption. High <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> in the range of ± 15 V and updating times of several sec- onds is typically used for operation of EPDs. This is to achieve best possible optical performance and user experience. The high voltage sub-circuits is found to typically constitute for 90 % of the total power consumption. By trading off fast response time and best optical performance with lower <b>driving</b> <b>voltages,</b> the total energy consumption is estimated to be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. Techniques such as unipolar driving waveforms and image updates in several stages at faster stage times can be used in combination. Theoretically, the <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> can be reduced to ± 2. 5 V with a total updating time in less than one second. This leads to a typical reduction of 20 - 40 % in optical perfor- mance. By designing a single chip EPD module based on lower <b>driving</b> <b>voltages,</b> it is estimated that the driving circuitry can potentially have an average power consumption below 1 mW. This is less than 5 % of the total worst case power con- sumption compared to the commercially available hardware tested in this thesis...|$|R

Currently, basic research is continuing in an attempt to increase the frame rate up to 100 Mfps and above. In order to suppress electro-magnetic noise at such high frequency, a digital-noiseless imaging transfer scheme has been developed utilizing solely sinusoidal <b>driving</b> <b>voltages.</b> This paper presents highly efficient-yet-accurate expressions to estimate attenuation as well as phase delay of <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> through RC networks of an ultra-high-speed image sensor. Elmore metric for a fundamental RC chain is employed as the first-order approximation. By application of dimensional analysis to SPICE data, we found a simple expression that significantly improves the accuracy of the approximation. Similarly, another simple closed-form model to estimate phase delay through fundamental RC networks is also obtained. Estimation error of both expressions is much less than previous works, only less 2 % for most of the cases. The framework of this analysis can be extended to address similar issues of other VLSI structures...|$|R

A comparison of several suspension designs is given, and the lateral large deflection behaviour of clamped–clamped beams and a folded flexure design is modelled. An expression for the axial spring constant of folded flexure designs including bending effects from lateral displacements, which reduce the axial stiffness, is also derived. The maximum deflection {{that can be}} obtained by comb-drive actuators is bounded by electromechanical side instability. Expressions for the side-instability voltage and the resulting displacement at side instability are given. The electromechanical behaviour around the resonance frequency is described by an equivalent electric circuit. Devices are fabricated by polysilicon surface micromachining techniques using a one-mask fabrication process. Static and dynamic properties are determined experimentally and are compared with theory. Static properties are determined by displacement-to-voltage, capacitance-to-voltage and pull-in voltage measurements. Using a one-port approach, dynamic properties are extracted from measured admittance plots.
