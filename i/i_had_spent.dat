[...] He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the Scottish Premier Division; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed manager.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and Portman first {{discussed}} a ballet film in 2000, {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream, though the script had not yet been written. He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|When Edward II succeeded {{his father}} Edward I on 7 July 1307, the {{attitude}} of his subjects was generally one of goodwill toward their new king. However, discontent was brewing beneath the surface. Some of {{this was due to}} existing problems left behind by the late king, while much was due to the new king's inadequacies. The problems were threefold. First there was discontent with the royal [...] policy for financing wars. To finance the war in Scotland, Edward I had increasingly resorted to so-called prises [...] or purveyance [...] to provision the troops with victuals. Though a perfectly legitimate method of raising money, the peers felt that the purveyance had become far too burdensome and compensation was in many cases inadequate or missing entirely. In addition, they did not like the fact that Edward II took prises for his household without continuing the war effort against Scotland, causing the second problem. While Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> the last decade of his reign relentlessly campaigning against the Scots, his son abandoned the war almost entirely. In this situation, the Scottish king Robert Bruce soon took the opportunity to regain what had been lost. This not only exposed the north of England to Scottish attacks, but also jeopardized the possessions of the English baronage in Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|They {{immediately}} shelved {{the film}} {{they had been}} working on and redirected their focus, essentially starting from scratch. [...] "But a lot of the homework I'd done for the first script {{and a lot of the}} contacts I made, carried over," [...] Boal remarked during an interview with Entertainment Weekly. He added, [...] "The years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> talking to military and intelligence operators involved in counter-terrorism was helpful in both projects.

2500|$|On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a {{surprise}} guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both {{said it was}} the first time they ever met. Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, [...] "It was interesting." [...] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was [...] "nervous to meet him, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> now, a year and a half thinking about him..." [...] He adds, [...] "Mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It’s the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable." ...|$|E

I told him that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> it on him. He asked me how. I said in trying to make him an honest man, and in {{repairing}} the results of his villainy. He shrieked out a curse, and pulling something out of the breast of his coat--a loaded stick, I think--he struck me with it, and I remembered nothing more." ...|$|E
