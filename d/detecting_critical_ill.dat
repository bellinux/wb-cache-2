30|$|We {{performed}} a prospective observational cohort study {{during a period}} of 10  weeks at the ICU and MCU for adults of VU University medical center in Amsterdam. Patients aged 18  years or older, with a positive Confusion Assessment Measurement for the ICU (CAM-ICU), were included in the study. CAM-ICU is the most widely used validated instrument to <b>detect</b> delirium in <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients, both mechanically and not mechanically ventilated patients [9, 10]. Furthermore, patients who received haloperidol on prescription of physicians on the indication of presumed delirium were considered to be delirious and were subsequently included, even in case of a negative CAM-ICU. Haloperidol is only prescribed by physicians in our department in case of suspected delirium. Patients could only be included once to minimize selection bias. Patients who had a prolonged admission and who were diagnosed with delirium previously {{before the start of the}} study, as well as patients diagnosed with delirium before admission to the ICU or MCU, were excluded.|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{explore the}} coping {{strategies}} responses that {{the intensive care}} unit nurses experiment when facing the death of a <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patient. Methods. Qualitative study of a phenomenological nature carried out on 16 professionals throughin-depth interviews. The selection of the participants was intentional and the incorporation was progressive until reaching the data saturation. The analytic scheme, proposed by Taylor- Bogdan, was followed to effectuate the data analysis. Results. The coping strategies identified after the qualitative analysis were grouped according to their frequency of appearance in primary and secondary strategies. Acceptance and distance are resources of primary coping strategies, whereas search for social support, self-confidence, cognitive redefinition, generation of positive emotions, denial and search for spiritual support are secondary coping strategies. Conclusion. Bereavement coping strategies on the death of the <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients is a very complex process which implies that nurses mobilize a large group of emotional resources to achieve adaptation. The strategies of acceptance and distance, as they are described in this study, must be considered adaptative strategies that demonstrate very clearly that caring for <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients represents a significant fight for nurses in a personal and professional sense...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the long-term {{quality of life}} of patients with severe sepsis after being discharged from hospital for 2 to 5 years. Methods Prospective cohort study and follow-up was conducted in 3 affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University. Three hundred and sixty two severe sepsis and non-sepsis <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients discharged from intensive care units of the participating hospitals during Jan. 1 st, 2002 to Mar. 1 st, 2007 were enrolled in present study. Fifty one cases were followed up,to the exclusion of those dead,loss to follow-up,refused to consent,younger than 18 years and the duration of stay in ICU was only or less than 1 day. Short form- 36 scale(SF- 36) was using to {{evaluate the}} {{quality of life of}} the 51 patients. Results The mean age of the 51 patients was 52. 25 ± 19. 08 years,of whom 39 (76. 5 %) were males and 12 (23. 5 %) were females. The mean follow-up time was 3. 41 ± 1. 24 years(1245. 3 ± 450. 3 days). No significant difference existed in age,gender,severity of disease and mean follow-up time between the patients survived from severe sepsis(n= 27) and other <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> as control group(n= 24). However,the length of stay in hospital,time in ICU,the ratio of mechanical ventilation and psychopharmacology therapy and mechanical ventilation(60. 2 ± 47. 4 days, 13. 3 ± 10. 6 days, 74. 0 %, 33. 3 %,respectively) were higher in the patients survived from severe sepsis compared with those survived from non-sepsis(27. 3 ± 12. 6 days, 4. 8 ± 2. 1 days, 45. 8 %, 8. 3 %,respectively,P < 0. 05 or P < 0. 01). The median scores of eight domains in SF- 36 were lower in severe sepsis patients compared with those in other <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients,but there was no statistic difference. Conclusion No significant difference has been found by a 5 years follow-up in the long-term quality of life between the patients with severe sepsis and with non-sepsis <b>critical</b> <b>ill...</b>|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Intensive {{care unit}} due to <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> {{patients}} and its special situation, require nurses {{who can take}} care for patients in their best manner.

30|$|Introduction: Prognosis {{of cardiac}} arrest {{survivor}} is mainly determined by ischemic brain injury. Post-cardiac arrest state {{is characterized by}} elevated circulating cytokines and hemodynamic instability, called as a sepsis-like syndrome. In many <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> diseases such as acute pancreatitis and sepsis, a low serum level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A- 1 (ApoA 1) were associated with poor outcomes.|$|R
40|$|Critical care {{units are}} {{a major cause of}} a {{disrupted}} circadian rhythm in patients [1, 2]. Light, noise, treatments, sedatives and mechanical ventilation throughout a 24 h time period are the major offenders of circadian rhythm disruption {{in the intensive care unit}} [ICU] [2]. Interestingly, circadian disruption is frequently associated with the occurrence of delirium having a high impact on outcome and mortality in the critically ill [3 - 5]. Endogenous melatonin, a mirror of our circadian rhythm, seems to play an important role in the development of delirium in <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients. Critically ill patients have been found to have abnormal melatonin levels indicating a disrupted circadian rhythm [6, 7]. Thus, results on melatonin expression in <b>critical</b> <b>ill</b> patients have generated a new interest in the use of exogenous melatonin and melatonin agonists to improve sleep, cognitive function or delirium. In fact, a very elegant randomized controlled trial recently demonstrated effectiveness in the use of a melatonin agonist (Ramelteon) versus placebo in the prevention of deliriu...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to <b>detect</b> <b>critical</b> knock for a gasoline engine by the common method of knock diagnosis. In this paper, a new approach is presented to <b>detect</b> <b>critical</b> knock for gasoline engines. Based on this approach knock diagnosis consists of four steps. Firstly, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is chosen as a pre-processor for a neural network to extract knock characteristic signals; Secondly, four characteristic factors are selected and calculated from knock characteristic signals; Thirdly, degree of memberships of the characteristic factors are calculated as the input and output of the neural network; and finally a RBF(Radial Basis Function) neural network is chosen, trained and applied to <b>detect</b> <b>critical</b> knock. Knock experiments were performed on a gasoline engine, {{and the application of}} the presented approach was studied. The results show that the presented method is practicable and can be applied to control the ignition of a gasoline engine working under critical knock which is admitted as an improved state of engine performance...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Critically ill {{patients}} experience major insults {{that lead to}} increased protein catabolism and a significant loss of lean body mass with an impact on weaning from the ventilator and muscle recovery. In critically {{ill patients}}, severe and persistent testosterone deficiency is very common after ICU admission.

More knowledge about how the endogenous production of glutamine is regulated is needed to outline better guidelines for glutamine supplementation in the future.|$|R
