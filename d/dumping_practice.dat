40|$|Solid Waste Management (SWM) {{system in}} Basrah has {{deteriorated}} recently {{to the point}} that only limited waste collection is undertaken in certain urban areas and disposal is largely to uncontrolled dump sites. In this study, the technical, economical, and environmental aspects of three SWM scenarios were investigated aiming to compare the scenarios and select the most appropriate one for implementation. Scenario 1 was to consider waste disposal into a sanitary landfill. Scenario 2 added waste transportation to transfer station before disposal to a sanitary landfill. Scenario 3 considered waste sorting, recycling and composting followed by landfill disposal in an integrated treatment disposal facility. The current open <b>dumping</b> <b>practice</b> was considered as the baseline scenario. According to economic analysis, the benefits from the revenues of selling the produced recyclables and compost did not improve the ranking of scenario 3. However, scenario 3 has gained positive recognition due to the environmental benefits of waste recycling. Therefore, final recommendations were in favour of scenario 3, which has been approved by the UNICEF, as well. Currently the recommended scenario is under implementation in Basrah, Iraq...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A plan {{of action}} is {{proposed}} to develop uses of non-ferrous slag and production of certain industrial materials from this waste material. A review of chemistry of non-ferrous slags suggested {{that it can be}} reprocessed to impart "cementitious " properties and furthermore an advantage could be taken of their latent "pozzolonaic " properties to test several potential applications such as- clinker ingredient, asphalt concrete additive, cemented mine backfill and binder for base stabilization. The authors note that in the last century blast furnace slag was considered as a "waste " product whose stocks grew at an alarming rate due to decades of accumulation and iron producers had to develop uses of this material to avoid a potentially catastrophic environmental situation. Non-ferrous slag producers could emulate this example set by the iron producers who successfully converted a "waste " into a "byproduct". Environmental concerns of the new millennium demand that the industry should find ways and means of depleting the ever-growing stockpiles of non-ferrous slag. The authors conclude that serious considerations from environmental and economic fronts favor reclamation of old slag dumps as well as processing of new non-ferrous slag as a viable alternative to the existing <b>dumping</b> <b>practice.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Banda Aceh, Indonesia, {{populated}} with 250. 000 inhabitants, produces 180 tons of waste daily. But only 165 tons are delivered to its 21 ha area of municipal landfill facility, the Gampong Jawa Landfill (GJL). Since 2009, GJL stopped the open <b>dumping</b> <b>practice</b> and switched to sanitary landfill system. However, landfill gas (LFG) generated is still naturally venting {{out into the}} atmosphere. For leachate treatment, GJL has an anaerobic, an aerobic, and a maturation pool. There is also an advanced biogas reactor, namely the Intermediate Treatment Facility (ITF), which has 40 kW electricity generating capacity. Two Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) systems also available, functioned to process human excrements with total capacity of 130 cubic meter. This research is conducted to study the potential electricity generation from all-combined available resources in GJL. It includes potentials from landfills, ITF, and WWTPs. Literature review, in-depth interviews, field survey, and spread-sheet simulation are methods that have been conducted to achieve the objectives. The result shows that GJL could benefit more than sufficient electricity for its own operations, and transmit the rest to the National Power Grid. Furthermore, all potential is then monetized by utilizing the new Indonesian Feed-in Tarif (FiT) regulations. And the Certified Emision Reductions (CERs) {{is also expected to}} be traded through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

30|$|Consequently, {{responsible}} authorities particularly municipalities and landfill operators nationwide are facing difficulty {{in dealing with}} staggering amount of MSW to dispose it in a sustainable way. In addition, the selection for ideal and feasible method in controlling the disposal of high quantities of MSW at economical costs that can avoid environmental damages are difficult to be decided due to various deliberations {{need to be made}} (Umar et al. 2010). Conventionally, landfilling of solid waste has been the most preferred method for solid waste disposal due to technical feasibility, ease of operation, minimum supervisions and low operation expenditure. In most countries, landfilling is the most acceptable means for eliminating MSW which favors to the technology exploitation and capital cost (Renou et al. 2008).While most of the landfills nowadays equipped with a level three sanitary systems, many developing countries are still struggling to equip state of the art facilities at the landfill. For example, there are 261 landfills in Malaysia whereby more than 80  % of them are being controlled tipping or open <b>dumping</b> <b>practice.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that it obscures lower cost of operation and maintenance compared to the other established techniques (incineration and advanced landfill system) (Halim et al. 2010 a). Unfortunately, this practice has caused excessive generation of leachate whereby if it is not treated and safely disposed, landfill leachate could be a potential source of surface and ground water contamination, as it may percolate through soils and subsoils, causing pollution to receiving waters (Aziz et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Coal mining is an {{important}} economic activity as it covers the energy demands, generates export revenues and creates employment opportunities. Mining can, however, impact the local environment. Different mining operations produce several types of waste materials {{and one of the}} major wastes produced by open-pit mines is waste rock, which is dumped at waste rock dumps. The waste rock dumps can impact the environment in several ways. For instance, in Vietnam open-pit mines have disturbed the beauty of region where {{an important}} tourist resort “Ha Long Bay” is located resulting in the conflict of interest between mining itself on one hand while the aesthetics of an environmentally sensitive area located nearby on the other hand. RAME (Research Association Mining and Environment) is a joint industry and academic research effort to promote sustainable solutions for the mining industry in Vietnam and was founded by the German research institutions and companies in the year 2005. The present work has been completed in the framework of execution of the RAME research project. This dissertation investigates the environmental as well as the stabilisation performance of traditional sidehill fill <b>dumping</b> <b>practice</b> from open-pit mines with a focus on existing dumping operations in the Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam. Special emphasis is put on the potential issues of sidehill fill dumping and several case studies are being presented to demonstrate the potential problems of disposal practice which resulted in the necessity of a new dumping approach. A new concept of dumping the waste rock in the form of layers as a solution has been proposed and implemented {{within the framework of the}} RAME research project. The new dumping concept constitutes the later parts of the investigation, in order to avoid potential dumping problems. Layered dumping as an alternative to the traditional sidehill fill disposal offers significant potential stabilisation and environmental benefits which are discussed in the present work. A particular focus is given to the economical comparison of the traditional as well as the new disposal approach to assess the feasibility of the layered dumping method. Cost comparison approach is developed in the present work for both sidehill fill and layered dumping based on a block model of the waste rock dump. The results of the model disclose the possible financial benefits for particular dumping profiles with the implementation of layered dumping. The results of cost comparison from the developed model are then compared to the actual cost of dumping operations in Vietnam. The results support the fact that the application of new dumping approach can help to resolve the conflicting issues of mining and environment while bringing economic benefits at the same time...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{advocates a}} phased {{approach}} {{to move from}} the open <b>dump</b> <b>practices</b> prevalent in developing countries to sustainable waste management based on“Bottom up” initiatives for dumpsite rehabilitation and “Top down ” initiatives for minimizing the wastes that reach the landfills and to enhance the waste stabilization at landfills. This is to be ably facilitated with “Top down ” Policy intervention and “Bottom up ” public private partnerships, commitment of executing agencies and the necessary financial support. The major areas of policy intervention and support for the successful implementation of the approach include capacity building, people’s participation, promotion and use of appropriate technologies and private sector participation. The steps may vary depending on local circumstances but all changes introduced should represent a progressive improvement. The general philosophy of the phased approach is that it assesses alternatives and aims to provide the most benefit or least damage to the environment as a whole, at an acceptable cost in the short and long term. 1...|$|R

Turkey is required to make its waste related legislation compatible with European Legislation {{as it is a}} candidate country of the European Union. Improper Turkish practices such as open burning and open <b>dumping</b> <b>practices</b> must be abandoned urgently, and robust waste management systems have to be structured. The determination of an optimum waste management system in any region requires a comprehensive analysis in which many criteria are taken into account by stakeholders. In conducting this sort of analysis, there are two main criteria which are evaluated by waste management analysts; economic viability and environmentally friendliness. From an analytical point of view, a central characteristic of sustainable development is an economic-ecological integration. It is predicted that building a robust waste management system will need significant effort and cooperation between the stakeholders in developing countries such as Turkey.

However, concerns over long-term effectiveness and durability of S/S needs to addressed, because contamination is contained but not removed. This requires effective chemical assessments to inform design. This study aims to design a suitable method for assessing S/S effectiveness, using a holistic risk based approach, for use during performance based S/S design. The processes that induce containment were evaluated, by assessing the solubility controlling mechanisms, and undertaking geochemical speciation modelling, to determine solubility controlling minerals. These findings can be used {{at the design stage}} to engineer S/S application to particular sites, and ensure long-term performance with minimal risk. Evaluations for structural master species (Al, Si, and Ca) and contaminants (Zn^ 2 ^+, Cr^ 3 ^+) in cement stabilised contaminated kaolin were undertaken. The influences of common soil components (Humic acid and sodium sulphate), and increasing hydration durations were also assessed, to inform containment effectiveness and chemical durability.

40|$|Even though trade wars between Italy and France were {{definitely}} not a new phenomenon, when in 1969 the six members of the EEC decided to lay down {{the foundations of the}} wine common market, they hardly imagined the consequences that this kind of decision would have implied later on. For the first time ever French leadership was seriously threatened by import wines: by the spring 1975, when the first symptoms of overproduction appeared, the stage was set for the harshest trade conflict ever occured between two of the major partners of the common market area. Accusations of despicable economic practices hampering the principle of free trade were facing claims of illegal dumping exercises. Starting from a simple model on reciprocal dumping developed by Brander and Krugman (1983), this paper analyses the impact on <b>dumping</b> <b>practices</b> among economies with imperfectly competitive industries and firms producing homogeneous output. Particular emphasis is given to the problem of market leadership and of modelling trade as a multi-stage game where retaliation plays a fundamental role. The impact of different strategic tools as tariffs and subsidies is analysed, together with the overall effect of trade or autarky on overall welfare. While the theory often suggest equivocal payoffs, when considering the case of France-Italy wine trade and in the light of available evidence, the long run gains brought about to French consumers in the form of lower prices, reduced monopoly power and increased competition seem to have outweighed the losses incurred by its producers. Even though rationale for trade inhibiting practices has been in this paper theoretically shown to be sound, we have seen that retaliation often wipes off the benefits coming about through tariffs, subsidies and the likes. Ultimately, all the argumentation introduced in this paper braces more or less directly the free trade solution, since trade increases welfare through the effect of a reduced degree of monopoly in each country. This is a solution desirable under the pure economic point of view. Endast sammandrag.

Rusconi's growing national channel starts its programming at noon, with a segment dedicated to children, during which various anime series are broadcast, like Lady Oscar and Lalabel, as well as successful original television series, like Star Trek, then in the early afternoon air-time is given to region-specific broadcasts, later restarting the national broadcast with more television series and the mid-afternoon children's programming block, Bim Bum Bam (offering episodes from numerous cartoon series, predominantly Japanese, like Chobin the Star Child, Sport Billy, Hello Spank, Squirrel Banner, Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog, Akaki Chi no Eleven). In the late afternoon the channel again broadcasts from local stations and an hour later airs a television series episode (like Paper Moon). Generally, in the early evening two films and one television series is broadcast. The network also offers plenty of air-time to sport programs dedicated to soccer, boxing, basketball and motor racing, including Andrea De Adamich's Grand Prix.Prime time hours were dedicated to series like Falcon Crest, Kojak, The Big Valley, Project UFO, and Mork & Mindy. On 23 April 1982 an official agreement was made between Gruppo Rusconi and the American network CBS for technical assistance and program sharing. However, only a few months after its appearance on a national scale funds began to dwindle, mostly due to exorbitant costs of managing broadcast transmission systems, something a print editing house like Rusconi probably wasn't aware of, but also due to the aggressive advertising policy from its main rival network, Canale 5. In fact, Rusconi's network relied on an external advertising provider, la Publikompass, to sell advertising space while Berlusconi's channel took advantage of owning its own advertising provider, Publitalia, which could easily personalize ad packages to clients using <b>dumping</b> <b>practices.</b> On 6 September 1982 Rusconi signed a collaboration agreement with Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of Canale 5, mainly focusing on a common policy for the management of advertising limits but also concerning the communal use of high frequency networks and the sharing of some programs.However, on 30 November of that same year, the Rusconi group are forced to sell the network for about 29 billion lire (approximately €15 Million) to Berlusconi, who merges it with [...] "Rete 10", also owned by Berlusconi, to found the new Italia 1, that according to the Fininvest company is oriented for a young audience.|$|R
