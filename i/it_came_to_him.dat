5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
500|$|Charles finally escaped Scotland in the French frigate L'Heureux {{and arrived}} back in France in September 1746. However, {{the fate of}} the money is not as clear. Cluny is {{believed}} to have retained control of it, and during his long years as a fugitive was at the centre of various futile plots to finance another uprising. Indeed, he remained in hiding in his Highland [...] "cage" [...] for the next eight years. Meanwhile, a cash-strapped Charles was constantly looking for his money and at least some of <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> later, paying for the minting of a campaign medal in the 1750s. However, it is said that all of the gold was never recovered. Charles, years later, accused Cluny of embezzlement. Whatever the case, the gold became a source of discord and grievance among the surviving Jacobites.|$|E
500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E

500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that the series should take place underwater, {{with a focus on}} those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, [...] "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E

2500|$|NFL {{executive}} Bill Granholm {{recalled that}} it was Hirsch's ability to make the overhead or over-the-shoulder catch that set him apart: [...] "He would run down the field with his chin {{high in the air}} -- with his head all the way back.

The bishop elect was scarcely known at court, and he had resorted to none of the usual methods of advancing his temporal interest. [...] "Being then sixty years old," [...] says his great-grandson, [...] "he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the offer, when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> from authority. The persuasion of his friends, particularly Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at length overcame his repugnance; and to that see, though very moderately endowed, he for ever after devoted himself, and resisted every offer of translation, though repeatedly made and earnestly recommended. To such of his friends as pressed an exchange upon him he was accustomed to reply, that Peterborough was his first espoused, and should be his only one." [...] He discharged his new duties with energy and kept up his episcopal visitations till his eightieth year.|$|E
