What began as a charitable effort to help Adrian Nyel establish a school for the poor in <b>De</b> <b>La</b> <b>Salle's</b> home town gradually became his life's work.

5|$|The first European outpost within modern Indiana was Tassinong, a French {{trading post}} {{established}} in 1673 near the Kankakee River. French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur <b>de</b> <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> {{came to the}} area in 1679, claiming it for King Louis the XIV of France. La Salle came to explore a portage between the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, and Father Ribourde, who traveled with La Salle, marked trees along the way. The marks survived to be photographed in the 19th century. In 1681, La Salle negotiated a common defense treaty between the Illinois and Miami nations against the Iroquois.|$|E
5|$|René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur <b>de</b> <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> (1643–87) was a French explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a canoe {{expedition}} {{to explore the}} Mississippi River basin.

La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached {{the mouth of the}} Mississippi River on April 6, 1682.|$|E

5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association for Teachers of English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public information campaign protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted in dozens of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him. After a stint in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first reputation management consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at <b>De</b> <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject. He also contributes occasional news features to a number of national media outlets and writes literary fiction.|$|E

He began getting scholarship offers starting with Cincinnati, but as a lifelong Michigan fan, he hoped for an offer from Michigan once they abandoned Rich Rodriguez' spread offense and hired head coach Brady Hoke and offensive coordinator Al Borges. Before Michigan made him an offer on March 28, 2011, he also received offers from Bowling Green and Toledo. He gave Michigan a verbal commitment on May 10, 2011. He became Michigan's first commit {{of the class of}} 2013 in order to eliminate recruiting distractions. Once he committed, he actively recruited prospects for the team.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed Florida {{as well as}} modern-day Mexico {{and much of the}} southwestern part of the continent. The {{northern}} and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain, and New France comprised much of what is now eastern Canada as well as the central Illinois Country. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman Robert Cavelier <b>de</b> <b>La</b> <b>Salle</b> launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France, at first believing he would find a path to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, La Salle found a route to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140years before, on April 9, 1682, La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.|$|E
