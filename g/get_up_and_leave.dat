25|$|In some countries, medical {{personnel}} may be slow {{to respond to}} accidents. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{students}} and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave,</b> while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, {{the students}} began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E
500|$|Marvin Digs, which Bakshi {{conceived}} as a [...] "flower child picture", was not completed {{the way he had}} intended: It [...] "was going to have curse words and sex scenes, and a lot more than that. [...] Of course, they wouldn't let me do that." [...] He described the disappointing result as a [...] "typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical". Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film [...] "an offensively bad picture, the kind that makes people who love animation <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the theater in disgust". Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E
60|$|BLANCO [shortly, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> the table] Never {{you mind}} what I done with it. I was done out of it. Let that {{be enough for}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor dear Miss Spooner," [...] said Patience, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> {{the room}} {{as though it were}} her duty to look at once after her old friend in the midst of these troubles.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} begins with a man playing the piano at a bar. Scenes also feature Keith singing the song in his bedroom, and himself at a bar with a woman, who is feeling bad for her, as the man <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the bar.|$|R
500|$|Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is {{the most}} notable artistic {{antecedent}} to Jaws. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the Orca, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar {{to the death of}} Ahab in Melville's novel. A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby-Dick; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the theater (Wesley Strick's screenplay for the 1991 remake of Cape Fear features a similar scene). However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the film's star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder. Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea: [...] "Jaws is... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped {{out of his chair}} and ran out of the room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm just glad he didn't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> because then I would have been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave.</b> I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good friend of mine, and said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury is going to think of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. What do you mean you don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|In the {{reception}} room, {{a boy named}} Billy won't stop staring at Don. Don is drawing a picture and then rips {{it out of his}} book and hands it to Billy, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving.</b> It is a picture of a boy standing in a hole in a cemetery. Behind him there is a grave with the name 'Billy' written on it.|$|R
50|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a Sunday church service. The preacher informs the {{congregation}} that their usual organist is ill, and asks for a volunteer to play. A ragged-looking man staggers to the organ. The congregation assumes he is drunk, but he plays a beautiful melody that is more moving than the preacher's sermon. When he finishes, the organist <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves,</b> while the congregation sits in amazed silence until the preacher asks them to pray.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the game, Madd Dogg visits the Johnson house and announces that he has received a gold record for his new album. Everyone inside discusses how they must now shift their focus to maintaining the gang and their business ventures and otherwise keep a low profile. CJ then <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the house. Kendl then asks where he's going, and he replies, [...] "Fittin' to hit the block, see what's happening," [...] as the game's main storyline ends.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few months}} later, {{a few people}} did muster the courage to start singing at an {{intermission}} in a Shabbos farbrengen a less overt song that implied that the Rebbe was the messiah. Within a few seconds the Rebbe heard it and immediately became very grave and said: [...] "Really, I should <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> [...] Even if some people consider it is not respectful that I need to , I don’t need to reckon with the views of a small number when [...] {{is the opposite of}} reality. However, first of all, it will unfortunately not help anyway. Secondly, it will disrupt the shevet achim gam yachad , for if I were to leave, others will leave, too." ...|$|E

50|$|Another notable {{example that}} plays with frame {{narrative}} is the 1994 film Forrest Gump. Most {{of the film}} is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the park bench. However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the bench, <b>and</b> we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son. This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny's dialogues.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens with}} a scene of playwright Marin Držić's (Sven Medvešek) comedy Dundo Maroje being staged {{in front of the}} Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, during the {{traditional}} Feast of St. Blaise. Local aristocrats, ambassadors and the Rector himself (Miše Martinović) are attending the performance of the comedy play, which is an allegory about the hypocrisy and injustice of high society. The verses spoken on stage are met with disapproval by the noblemen present, and lead to the Rector <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> during the performance.|$|R
50|$|Nathan awakens from a coma, or resurrected if he died, <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the {{plantation}} house. He wanders {{for a long}} time still dazed from the blow to his head. Finally he sees Roy coming out of Sunday evening church, but Roy is with his family, so Nathan wanders around some more waiting for Roy to get home. Nathan's mother <b>leaves</b> his father, <b>and</b> Nathan, his head now clear, finds Roy crying in the barn where Nathan slept while hiding from his father. As Roy looks up, he sees Nathan and hugs him.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him fixedly for several moments. He was half afraid {{that she was going}} to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> him. Instead, however, she broke into a hard little laugh, and helped herself to another cigarette.|$|E
60|$|I {{drew closer}} to her. She tried to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> me. I knew my power over her, {{and used it}} (as any man in my place would have used it) without scruple. I took her hand.|$|E
60|$|Tom's next {{unconscious}} blunder was to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> {{the table}} {{just when the}} chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was {{in the act of}} beginning the blessing. Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Newbury Park, California and begins with Carlton going into her garage and {{throwing}} a sheet off her piano. She starts playing {{and the song}} begins, and while she's playing, the piano starts moving outside near parades downtown, joggers and bikers out on the road, through the beach, {{and other parts of}} the city, gradually taking place until the sun sets. At the end of the video, she's back in her garage where the video began <b>and</b> she <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the garage.|$|R
50|$|Touched, Jean logs {{onto the}} {{internet}} using Holly's screen name {{and talks to}} Adam. Adam, thinking it's Holly, says that her mom is setting a bad example, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> when things <b>get</b> bad and that, in return, is making a bad role model for her own daughters. Jean is deeply moved by this and decides to stay, finding a new job and trying to rebuild her life without running away. She also apologizes to her daughter and tells her {{to look at the}} other side of the drawing, making Holly happy.|$|R
50|$|As {{portrayed in}} the 2015 miniseries Sons of Liberty Dickinson is shown {{continually}} speaking out against prematurely fighting the British and voting {{on the idea of}} a Declaration of Independence. He suggests a request first be made from the Continental Congress to the King of England, {{in the form of the}} Olive Branch Petition. The program gives no indication that Dickinson would author the petition. As the Congress votes on independence, the miniseries portrays Dickinson <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> the room without explanation, and no summary was given of his overall contributions to the American Revolution or what would become of him later.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he gazed}} on a town by besiegers taken, [...] Nor cared he who were winning; [...] But {{he saw an}} old maid, for years forsaken, [...] <b>Get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> her spinning; [...] 80 [...] And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass, [...] She said--"pray are the rapes beginning?"[39] ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she made}} this last assurance, {{they heard the}} steps of Lily and her lover close to them, and they both felt {{that it would be}} well that their {{intercourse}} should thus be brought to a close. Neither had known how to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the place, and yet each had felt that nothing further could then be said.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was {{beginning}} to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2000 World Championships, Obertas/Palamarchuk were 10th {{after the}} short program {{but during the}} free skate Palamarchuk caught an edge (right skate) while {{executing}} an overhead lift with Obertas - she was uninjured in the resulting fall but he hit {{his head on the}} ice. No medical attention was immediately offered at the event in Nice, France. Palamarchuk lay on the ice for several minutes before <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> the ice on his own but then lost consciousness and was taken to hospital - no damage was found but he was kept overnight for observation. Their partnership dissolved after that.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{accidents}} resulting in withdrawals. Julia Obertas / Dmitri Palamarchuk, who were 10th after the short program, {{withdrew from the}} pairs event after a fall during the free skating.

Palamarchuk lay on the ice for several minutes before <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> the ice on his own but then lost consciousness and was taken to hospital - no damage was found but he was kept overnight for observation.|$|R
5000|$|Billie Jo and {{her father}} begin to drift apart from each other. After the deaths, Billie Jo stops calling her father [...] "Daddy." [...] Scarred and burned, Billie Jo is left unable to play piano, {{one of the few}} joys that had {{remained}} in her life. Time goes on, and she begins to notice spots on her father's face, similar to those on her grandfather when he had skin cancer. After trying to return to her former life style, Billie Jo becomes desperate {{to get out of the}} dust, so she <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> one night with only a handful of biscuits.|$|R
6000|$|So, too, {{with the}} clergy in Mariposa. They have no politics--absolutely none. Yet Dean Drone round {{election}} time always announces as his text such a verse as: [...] "Lo! {{is there not}} one righteous man in Israel?" [...] or: [...] "What ho! is it not time for a change?" [...] And that is a signal for all the Liberal business men to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> their pews.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brownbee rose a stoutish man some {{seventy years}} of age, with little grey side whiskers, {{and one of}} those utterly steady faces only to be seen in England, faces which convey the sense of {{business}} from father to son for generations; faces which make wars, and passion, and free thought seem equally incredible; faces which inspire confidence, and awaken in one a desire to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the room. Mr. Brownbee rose, and said in a suave voice: ...|$|E
60|$|A minute {{previously}} Mr. Meeke had summoned courage {{enough to}} <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> the room quietly. I noticed him walking demurely away, {{close to the}} wall, with his fiddle held under one tail of his long frock-coat, {{as if he was}} afraid that the savage passions of Mr. James Smith might be wreaked on that unoffending instrument. He got to the door before my mistress. As he softly pulled it open, I saw him start, and the rustling of the gown caught my ear again from the outside.|$|E
6000|$|Possessed {{myself of}} a strong stomach and a hard head, inured to hardship, cruelty, and brutality, {{nevertheless}} I found, as I came to manhood, that I unconsciously protected myself from the hurt of the trained-animal turn by <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> the theatre whenever such turns came on the stage. I say [...] "unconsciously." [...] By this I mean it never entered my mind {{that this was a}} programme by which the possible death-blow might be given to trained-animal turns. I was merely protecting myself from the pain of witnessing what it would hurt me to witness.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens on}} Baxter and Annie Fang (Jack McCarthy and Mackenzie Smith) holding {{hands in the}} back of their parents car as their father Caleb (Jason Butler Harner) dons a {{security}} guard uniform. The family enters a bank and Baxter uses a gun to rob a teller of all her lollipops. Baxter shoots his gun when Caleb rushes him, while posing as a security guard. Their mother Camille (Kathryn Hahn) pretends to be shot, and Annie grieves over her prone body. When the family <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves,</b> Caleb gives a speech to the bank patrons about cherishing life and takes a bow.|$|R
50|$|At {{the next}} therapy session, Dr. Melfi scolds Tony, for {{she has seen}} him ripping out a page from a magazine. Melfi then {{proceeds}} to attack Tony throughout their session, mainly firing sarcastic comments whilst he discusses his recent problems. As the session continues, she offers to refer Tony to another doctor, leaving him somewhat confused. Finally, Melfi tells Tony that she cannot help him, saying that, due to his current family crisis, {{she does not want}} to waste his time. Tony <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> the room as Melfi follows him back to the waiting room. Tony then takes out the folded-up steak recipe page out of his pocket, unfolds it, and gently and sarcastically places it back inside the magazine from which it came. Melfi then shuts the door, seemingly ending her professional relationship with Tony Soprano once and for all.|$|R
