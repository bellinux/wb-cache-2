40|$|Abstract: Multiple {{studies have}} {{reported}} that surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of fl ight <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (SELDI-TOF-MS) is useful in the early detection of disease based on the analysis of bodily fl uids. Use of any multiplex <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> based approach as {{in the analysis of}} bodily fl uids to detect disease must be analyzed with great care due to the susceptibility of multiplex and <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> methods to biases introduced via experimental design, patient samples, and/or methodology. Specifi c biases include those related to experimental design, patients, samples, protein chips, chip reader and spectral analysis. Contributions to biases based on patients include demographics (e. g., age, race, ethnicity, sex), homeostasis (e. g., fasting, medications, stress, time of sampling), and site of analysis (hospital, clinic, other). Biases in samples include conditions of sampling (type of sample container, time of processing, time to storage), conditions of storage, (time and temperature of storage), and prior sample manipulation (freeze thaw cycles). Also, there are many potential biases in methodology which can be avoided by careful experimental design including ensuring that cases and controls are analyzed randomly. All the above forms of biases affect any system based on analyzing multiple analytes and especially all <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> based methods, not just SELDI-TOF-MS. Also, all current <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> systems have relatively low sensitivity compared with immunoassays (e. g., ELISA). There are several problems which may be unique to the SELDI-TOF-MS system marketed by Ciphergen®. Of these, the most important is a relatively low resolution (± 0. 2 %) of the bundled mass spectrometer which may cause problems with analysis of data. Foremost, thi...|$|R

In this study we aimed to investigat and compare the efficiency of MALDI-TOF <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> method through Biochemical and Molecular methods for detecting Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Materials and Methods: seventhy five clinical samples were collected for biochemical, molecular and <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> investigations. Samples were treated with Esculin hydrolysis, Catalase, Pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase, 6. 5 % NaCl solution, motility, 0. 04 % Tellurite, L-Arabinose and Sorbitol. Using specific primes allele specific PCR was used. The samples were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and Biotyper 3 software. Results: Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were detected in thirty and forty two samples, respectively whereas three samples showed both bacterial infections. Using biochemical analysis, two E. faecium isolates were Arabinose negative and one E. faecalis isolates was Telliurite negative. All samples were showed correct bands in PCR results but two of them didn't show clear bands(on agarose gel). In <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> analysis all strains were correctly detected and well defined. Conclusion: According to our results, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in comparison with Molecular and Biochemical Methods could be a reliable and accurate method that can easily and quickly identify and differentiate Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis in clinical samples.
