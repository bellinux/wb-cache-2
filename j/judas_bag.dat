5000|$|Mannar Island is also notably {{one of the}} {{few places}} in Sri Lanka where baobab trees thrive. The baobab tree, native to Africa, was bought by Arab sailors to feed camels which they {{stationed}} in the area. Although camels are not found in today, few baobab trees still thrive on the hot sandy Mannar region. The baobab (Adansonia digitata) belongs to the family Bombacaceae. It appear strange and barrel-like enormous trunk, which tapers into branches. When the leaves are shed, the tree gives the impression that it had been planted upside down. The name baobab comes from the Arabic plant name buhibab, while the scientific name is after the French Botanist M. Adanson (1727-1806). The tree is more known for its girth than height: trunks attain a diameter of 9 m (30 ft) in some cases, and are hollow in the centre. The bark is rough and greyish, and since it resembles the hide of an elephant, but Tamils refer to it as perukkaa which means [...] "large fruit". Catholics in Mannar call baobab the <b>Judas</b> <b>bag</b> given the 30 seeds its fruit contains. Monkeys love the fruit and hence the tree is sometimes known as the monkey-bread tree. The dugong is a medium-sized marine mammal which is found in Mannar bay, Nachchikuda, Jaffna island and near Adams bridge.That has rich in sea grasses. IUCN conservation status is vulnerable because of over hunting for meat purpose and untargetly captured by fishing net.|$|E

So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.27 And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.29 For some thought, because <b>Judas</b> had the <b>bag,</b> that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.30 He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.|$|R

Weigh it attentively, so as to {{get good}} {{satisfaction}} from the Word to these important questions-Am I in Christ, the way, the only way, to the kingdom, or not? Do I see that all other ways, whether of sin or self-righteousness, lead to hell? Does Christ dwell in my heart by faith? Am I a new creature in Him? Do I renounce my own righteousness, as well as abhor my sins? Do I look alone to Christ for righteousness, and depend only on Him for holiness? Is He the only hope of my soul, and the only confidence of my heart? And do I desire {{to be found in}} Him; knowing by the Word, and feeling by the teaching of His Spirit, that I am totally lost in myself? Thus, is Christ formed in me, the only hope of glory? Do I study to please Him, as well as hope to enjoy Him? Is fellowship with God the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, so prized by me, as to seek it, and to esteem it above all things? If so, though I may find all things in nature, in the world, and from Satan, continually opposing this, yet I am in Christ the way, and He is in me the truth and the life-(Mason). How far may such an one go? This important question is very solemnly argued in Bunyan's Law and Grace. He may be received into church-fellowship-and, like the foolish virgins, be clear from outward pollution-have gone forth from the rudiments and traditions of men-and had their lamps, but still lost their precious souls. They may bear office in the church, as <b>Judas</b> carried the <b>bag,</b> and as Demas! They may become preachers and ministers of the Gospel, with rare gifts, and a fluent tongue, like an angel, to speak of the hidden mysteries; but may die under the curse. They may have the gifts of the Spirit and prophecy, and be but a Balaam. They may stand thus until Christ come and reveal them. They may, with confidence, say, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drank in Thy presence, and taught in Thy name, and in Thy name have cast out devils? and yet, poor creatures, be shut out!-(ED).|$|R
