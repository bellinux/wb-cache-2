25|$|In 1866, Nelson Story {{traveled}} to Texas and spent $10,000 for 1000 (some accounts indicate possibly {{as many as}} 3000) head of Longhorn cattle. 1866 was {{the first year after}} the end of the American Civil War and the economy of Texas, as in the rest of the former Confederacy, was devastated. However there were significant numbers of cattle roaming Texas which could be had for very little money. Also, there was great demand for beef in the northern states along with money to pay for <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>many</b> returning Confederate soldiers begged or borrowed a stake to get a herd together. Many others signed on as trail drive cowboys. Give or take, about 260,000 cattle were driven north from Texas that summer toward the nearest rail shipping point at Sedalia, Missouri in hopes of selling them there for a quick profit. To reach Sedalia, the cattle first had to be driven through the territory which was to become Oklahoma, but which at the time was the Indian Territory. This was the domain of the remnants of the Five Civilized Nations who had survived the Trail of Tears. While the tribes previously had tolerated the passage of a few herds, an exodus of this magnitude threatened their ability to support their own grazing cattle. Rather than blocking the herds entirely, they decided to charge 10 cents a head for passage. The drovers mostly paid the fee.|$|E

500|$|LittleBigPlanet (PS3) by Media Molecule and Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) {{was one of}} {{the most}} highly {{anticipated}} games of 2008. Upon release, it received high critical acclaim with a score of 95/100 on Metacritic and was the second most highly rated game of that year (behind Grand Theft Auto IV). It was praised by G4 as a game that [...] "not only lives up to the hype but exceeds <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> ways" [...] and IGN called it [...] "nothing short of astounding". Its sequel, LittleBigPlanet 2 was released in 2011 to similar acclaim and is considered an improvement over its predecessor in almost every aspect.|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons {{opens with}} [...] "Elements", which [...] "blends {{acoustic}} guitars, flugelhorns, synths, skittering breakbeat rhythms, a folksy harmonica, and ... a falsetto 'doo-doo' chorus". Overlaying {{the music is}} a voiceover, courtesy of English actor John Standing, that lists the basic 'elements' {{that make up the}} world: ash, metal, water, wood, fire, and (eventually, later in the song) sky. The second track, [...] "Space Walk", is set to a recording of Ed White's 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission. Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called Flight to the Moon (1969); the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were. Deakin later said, [...] "'One small step' leaves me cold, because it was so obviously scripted. But the spacewalk… even after hearing <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times, it's so vivid." ...|$|E

Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes."

However, he also thought that [...] "the script delivers lots of heroics and funny moments for the Doctor, Amy and Rory", and he praised the [...] "terrific cast", describing Helen McCrory as [...] "majestic". IGN's Matt Wales rated [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] 7 out of 10, saying that it [...] "had plenty of standout moments, even if it didn't quite manage to come {{together to form a}} completely satisfying whole". He praised the comedy between Amy and Rory and McCrory's acting, as well as the location shots and Croatia and thought [...] "the sci-fi retcon of classic vampire phenomenon was particularly clever", believing that the aliens went beyond two-dimensional. However, he agreed with Fuller and Mulkern that [...] "its single biggest problem was one of over-familiarity", with many misplaced alien races having featured before.|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, {{one of the guards}} at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
500|$|Sifton's {{first foray}} into {{politics}} was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of prohibition {{under the auspices of}} the Canada Temperance Act in the Manitoba electoral districts of Lisgar and Marquette. [...] His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council. [...] He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term, though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected. [...] He also served on the local school board. [...] When his brother Clifford became Wilfrid Laurier's Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada. [...] This advice included suggested patronage appointments, one of which was an unimplemented proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the Northwest Territories (a position that did not at the time exist). [...] In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging Robert Brett, the long-time Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for Banff, in the 1898 territorial election. [...] Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. [...] Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin. [...] One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. [...] After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times. [...] He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement.|$|E

2500|$|After {{constantly}} explaining {{concepts and}} story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose {{to keep the}} thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves.

2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story did nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>many</b> performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead.

2500|$|In 1993, Hamburg {{mentioned}} {{the idea of}} a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment on November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as [...] "the Beast", which Wilkinson describes as [...] "a headless monster that lurches through postwar history," [...] a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, and helped Nixon's rise to power and his fall from it as well.

2500|$|The album {{features}} no printed lyrics, but {{it seems}} likely to connect with Isis's past legacy of concept albums, wherein some of the lyrics (such as [...] "She was his queen" [...] from [...] "Dulcinea") relate to past themes. Turner has confirmed {{the presence of a}} concept: [...] "I won't say what the concept is, but I can give you some clues about what inspired it: Hassan-i-Sabbah, the Islamic mystic cult leader, [...] Don Quixote, [...] House of Leaves, and [...] Labyrinths." [...] However; from repeated explanation of what inspired Oceanic and Panopticon, his stance changed. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to the music and the lyrics simply from having repeated <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times. And for me, personally, it's really important to maintain that connection as much as possible.

2500|$|As Clarissa {{prepares for}} the party she thinks of the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who {{recently}} came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
