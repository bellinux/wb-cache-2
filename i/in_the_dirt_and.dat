25|$|Positioned behind home plate, {{the catcher}} {{can see the}} whole field, and is {{therefore}} {{in the best position}} to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt,</b> <b>and</b> contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.|$|E
500|$|Riff Raff and Magenta {{interrupt}} the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens {{from the planet}} Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan {{to return to their}} home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has [...] "failed his mission". An enraged Rocky, impervious to Riff Raff's laser gun, gathers Frank in his arms, climbs {{to the top of the}} tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt,</b> <b>and</b> the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, [...] "lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning".|$|E

50|$|A {{mathematical}} game {{found in}} West Africa is {{to draw a}} certain figure by a line that never ends until it closes the figure by reaching <b>the</b> starting point (<b>in</b> mathematical terminology, this is a Eulerian path on a graph). Children use sticks to draw these <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> or sand, <b>and</b> of course the game can be played with pen and paper.|$|R

2500|$|Slanderers are {{not content}} with knowing a thing, but “proceed to assume jurisdiction, and when they know a slight offense of another, carry it into every corner, and are delighted and tickled that they can stir up another's displeasure , as swine roll {{themselves}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> root in it with the snout.” [...] Luther describes this as meddling with the judgment and office of God, and pronouncing sentence and punishment with the most severe verdict. Without wielding the sword, the slanderer employs a poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of your neighbor.|$|E
2500|$|Preventing wild {{pitches and}} {{avoiding}} passed balls. Although the pitcher {{has a responsibility}} to throw with reasonable accuracy, catchers must be mobile enough to catch (or block) errant pitches. By doing so, a catcher prevents baserunners from advancing while the loose ball is retrieved. An errant pitch that eludes the catcher and allows a baserunner to take one or more additional bases is called a wild pitch. (Techniques for blocking wild pitches are described in the previous section.) A pitched ball which would require only ordinary effort to be caught or blocked by the catcher—but is nonetheless misplayed, allowing a base runner to advance—is called a [...] "passed ball". If any pitch is thrown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt,</b> <b>and</b> is considered to be too hard for the catcher to block, it's considered to be called a [...] "Wild Pitch". If a pitcher throws the pitch and it touches your glove and goes away from you, allowing the base runner to advance, is called a [...] "Passed Ball".|$|E

50|$|Deterioration: After {{the site}} has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any {{structures}} that have been built.

50|$|By the 1950s, coal was {{no longer}} mined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and land was {{developed}} {{for the construction of}} about 3,500 houses, which was completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s. Then, the initial instances of subsidence began, such as one on Mount View Lane in 1963.

50|$|By {{lengthening}} {{the surface}} between the high voltage terminal and the grounded metal {{case of the}} spark plug, the physical shape of the ribs functions to improve the electrical insulation and prevent electrical energy from leaking along the insulator surface from the terminal to the metal case. The disrupted and longer path makes the electricity encounter more resistance along {{the surface of the}} spark plug even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> moisture. Some spark plugs are manufactured without ribs; improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dielectric strength of the insulator make them less important.|$|R

500|$|Influenced by bands {{such as the}} Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin, and the New York Dolls, Aerosmith {{proved to}} be a major {{influence}} themselves on subsequently massively successful bands and musicians; according to Perry, Eddie Van Halen once told him that his band Van Halen [...] "started out on the suburban L.A. club circuit, playing Aerosmith songs". Aerosmith's influence was evident on the next generation of hard rock and heavy metal bands, namely Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Guns N' Roses, Tesla, L.A. Guns, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat, Skid Row, Extreme, Warrant, Inglorious, the Black Crowes, and the Quireboys, as well as Metallica, Metal Church, and Testament. Especially, Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash has stated that Aerosmith is his favorite band, and Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx has expressed massive admiration for the band and its early records <b>in</b> both <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> <b>and</b> [...] Members of alternative rock bands such as Nirvana, Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Staind and Godsmack are also self-professed early Aerosmith fans.|$|R
25|$|Neither Murphy {{or any of}} {{the other}} pilots were very {{successful}} in hitting their targets, but the high winds which regularly blow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region <b>in</b> late spring and early summer most likely contributed to their inaccuracy. The first bomb to actually hit Arizona soil landed at 7:45 AM on April 2 and it was followed by others over the next few days. Murphy's bombing runs smashed windows and otherwise damaged several buildings on the American side of the border, including a garage, the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile and the Haas Pharmacy. One bomb also struck the post office building, making it a federal offense, and another landed next to one of the idle train cars used by the crowd of spectators. Other bombs left large craters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> streets <b>and</b> other unpaved surfaces. Yet another bomb landed on and devastated a regal Dodge touring car owned by a Mexican Army officer, which had been left on the American side of the border for safekeeping during the expected hostilities.|$|R
