Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, <b>in</b> <b>using</b> a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

He continued to strengthen the central government by expanding the Navy and Army.

5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic <b>in</b> <b>using</b> the tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not {{accepted in the}} United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E

5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training <b>in</b> <b>using</b> the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest <b>in</b> <b>using</b> Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term.

5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved <b>in</b> <b>using</b> the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 {{the myth}} of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid.

Hughes was also complimented on his achievements <b>in</b> <b>using</b> humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively.
