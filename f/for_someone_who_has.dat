5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not {{devoted his life to}} him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Scotland {{does not}} {{consider}} marriage to be a sacrament, and thus not binding forever, and has no moral objection to the remarriage of divorced persons. The minister who is asked to perform a ceremony <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a prior spouse living may inquire {{for the purpose of}} ensuring that the problems which led to the divorce do not recur.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, a {{combination}} of psychotherapy and medication can often produce good results, although research evidence of this approach has been less robust. Some improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time, about 6 to 8 weeks. Psychotherapy can improve the effectiveness of medication, {{reduce the likelihood of}} relapse <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> discontinued medication, and offer help for people with panic disorder who do not respond at all to medication.|$|E

50|$|Yes, {{there are}} first edition copies of Kurban Said's books in Elfriede's metal chest at the Lichtenau Castle {{but that is}} not proof of authorship. It would be quite natural <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{registered}} the novels to have copies.|$|R
25|$|Since 1996, it {{has been}} {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> gone through sex reassignment surgery to legally change their sex in their official documents. However, the law governing the ability of transgender persons to change their identity is vague and incomplete, resulting in inconsistency in judicial practice concerning legal recognition of gender identity. In some cases authorities denied recognition {{of a change in}} identity unless a sex-reassignment intervention had occurred. Because of the difficult legal procedure for gender recognition, it is often impossible for transgender persons to get documents reflecting their gender identity, which leads to difficulties in all services requiring identity documents (health care, transportation passes, banking services).|$|E

500|$|Considerable media {{pressure}} {{is applied to}} nominees and winners of the Turner Prize. [...] The 2003 winner Grayson Perry stated that [...] "Such media storms can be traumatising <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> laboured away for years in a studio, making art not news." [...] Some artists, including Sarah Lucas and Julian Opie, {{have decided not to}} participate in the event, regarding a nomination as [...] "a poisoned chalice". [...] Stephen Deuchar, Director of Tate Britain suggested [...] "We want the artists to be comfortable with media pressure. We have to shield them".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Nussbaum also censured certain {{scholarly}} trends. She excoriated deconstructionist Jacques Derrida as [...] "on truth [...] simply not worth studying <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been studying [...] Quine and [...] Putnam and [...] Davidson" [...] and also cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida's analysis of Chinese culture [...] "pernicious" [...] and without [...] "evidence of serious study". [...] More broadly, Nussbaum criticized Michel Foucault for his [...] "historical incompleteness [...] lack of conceptual clarity", but nevertheless singled {{him out for}} providing [...] "the only truly important work to have entered philosophy {{under the banner of}} 'postmodernism.'" [...] Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like Allan Bloom, Roger Kimball, and George Will for what she considers their [...] "shaky" [...] knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today's humanities departments.|$|E
2500|$|The Fremen {{spend all}} {{time out of}} their sietch in a stillsuit, a special body-enclosing suit {{designed}} to collect and recycle all the moisture the body releases, from urine, feces and sweat, to the exhalation of water vapor in the breath. The special fabric is a micro-sandwich designed to dissipate heat and filter wastes while reclaiming moisture. [...] The water is then held in catchpockets and made available to drink through a tube. A Fremen in a well-kept suit can survive weeks in the desert without any other source of water. Because of their culture's focus on water conservation, it is generally considered a great sign of respect among the Fremen to spit before a person. Fremen also put a great cultural reverence on crying and tears. Tears shed <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> died {{are referred to as}} [...] "Giving Water to the Dead" [...] and regarded with much bemusement.|$|E

[...] "There is no listing for the GanKinMan Foundation on the websites of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission or the Australian Business Register." [...] The SIDS charity is registered to Messenger's husband, Leslie Bailey. Messenger stated that cancelling the lectures would set a bad precedent as {{people need to be}} informed and have all sides presented in order to make good parenting decisions. She said that visas should not be cancelled <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> done nothing wrong.

2500|$|He {{made his}} debut in 1988, {{reaching}} the top makuuchi division in 1993. He held {{the second highest}} rank of ōzeki or champion for eleven years from 2000 to 2011, and is the longest-serving ōzeki of all time in terms of number of tournaments fought. In his career he won five top division yūshō or tournament championships, the last coming in 2004. This is the modern record <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not ultimately made the top rank of yokozuna. [...] He was a runner-up in eleven other tournaments, and also won 15 sanshō or special prizes, the third highest ever. In November 2009 he broke the record previously held by Takamiyama for the most tournaments {{ranked in the top}} division, and in January 2010 he surpassed Chiyonofuji's record of most top division bouts won. In the May 2010 tournament he became the only wrestler besides Chiyonofuji to reach one thousand career wins, and he surpassed Chiyonofuji's career wins record of 1045 in July 2011. He retired in the same tournament to become a coach at Tomozuna stable under the elder name Asakayama. In 2014, he established the latest incarnation of the Asakayama stable.|$|E
2500|$|However, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: [...] "All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me"(3.12.69–70). Antony's speech conveys {{pain and}} anger, but he acts in {{opposition}} to his emotions and words, all {{for the love of}} Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: [...] "Antony's agony is curiously muted <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> achieved and lost so much." [...] This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: [...] "the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves". However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in Antony and Cleopatra is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: [...] "Tell me how much you love." [...] Prominent professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tzachi Zamir, points out: [...] "The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty" [...] and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.|$|E

Carter of MTV. After the performance she received a standing ovation from fans and critics. According to USA Todays Cindy Clark she [...] "captivated the audience with her powerful performance". Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun concluded, [...] "Adele's 'Someone Like You' could make a tough guy weep. Her tone was gorgeous." [...] Rating the performance with A, Claire Suddath of Time magazine said [...] "it's heartening to hear a truly talented woman sing a mournful torch song <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> left her for someone better. And if her stellar performance, accompanied by only a piano, isn't enough to melt your heart, then her nervous wave to the audience at the end definitely will." [...] A writer of Los Angeles Times called her vocals [...] "strong and direct, and tackles grief by moving with the melody {{rather than trying to}} pummel it" [...] and added that it was [...] "less-is-more performance, a tactic award-show producers rarely indulge in, but Adele needs few adornments to impress." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Adele brought a [...] "big dollop of elegance to the VMAs with a spare, moving rendition of 'Someone Like You'" [...] and added that [...] "amid all the pop art glitz, it [...] was a refreshing palate cleanser." ...|$|E
