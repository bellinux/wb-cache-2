50|$|It {{was while}} working on the two {{projector}} video installation, People In Buildings (1988-89), that Hall began his concentrated use of photography, although other video installations followed into the late 1990s, sometimes in conjunction with still photography. As of this writing (summer, 2010), several of them are being been digitally restored in preparation for their acquisition by The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, University of California for its permanent collection. In addition to People in Buildings, the museum is acquiring The Victims’ Regret, 1983, Terminal Landscape, 1995, and The Order of Things, 1997. In {{an interview with the}} architectural historian, Richard Tuttle, Hall explained his shift to still photography as “a need to free myself from the narrative of time-based media. And by narrative I not only mean the unfolding of events {{in the sense of a}} story but more importantly a temporality that flows and takes the viewer along with it-like a leaf fallen into a river, moving at a speed that’s determined by the current.” In a more recent on line interview in spring 2010 Hall added, “Still images invite a sort of retinal drifting. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the things Walter Benjamin is referring to when he speaks about photography and an ‘optical unconscious.’” The first photographs that grew out of his research for People in Buildings were of institutional corridors and other transitional spaces that he called Non-places. Since then, large format photography has been Hall’s primary focus. He has traveled widely producing a significant body of work that compliments his earlier video and video installations. His photographs have been shown in galleries and museums throughout the world and are included in several museum collections in both the United States and Europe. “Since the late 1980s Hall has investigated (through photography) the visual structure of how we experience spaces and the cultural conditioning of how we understand places. From stark institutional corridors and government offices to Baroque galleries and archives; from swimming pools in Las Vegas to reflection ponds in Asia, Hall's seductive photographs have long addressed how pictorial strategies can affect the way we see and perceive ourselves in the world.” A small, traveling survey of his photographs, accompanied by a catalog, was organized by The Newcomb Art Gallery, Tulane University, Louisiana in 2003.|$|E

40|$|What I {{am going}} to say this {{afternoon}} about bird control in hang¬ars won 2 ̆ 7 t take but a few minutes, mainly because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> area that we already have partial solutions. By this I mean that in most instances, at least where I 2 ̆ 7 ve worked, we 2 ̆ 7 ve been able to solve most of the hangar bird problems. Some of you have probably worked on similar problems or have worked in airplane hangars and after the session I 2 ̆ 7 ll certainly welcome any comments you may have. What I have to say will relate mainly to what I 2 ̆ 7 ve done myself, or the men who work for me have done. This will be first-hand experience. Most of the work has been done on military installations. Spe¬cifically, it 2 ̆ 7 s been done at Clinton Air Force Base in Ohio, Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, Lockbourne Air Force Base in Ohio, Wright-Patterson Field in Ohio, and Selfridge Air Force Base in Mich¬igan. The reason we 2 ̆ 7 ve worked only on military bases is three-fold. One is that in many cases the private pest control operators have con¬tractual agreements with private air bases. Another is that maybe the public airports fail to realize that something can be done to help them. A third reason is that the Department of Interior has a working agree¬ment with the Department of Defense in taking care of pest bird prob¬lem species on their military installations. As far as public or private airports are concerned, especially in hangar work or in building work with roosting birds, I think the role in control should be with the private pest control industry, once they know the proper techniques of solving these problems. I myself would love {{to get out of this}} type of activity. It 2 ̆ 7 s a lot of work and there 2 ̆ 7 s a lot in¬volved.

40|$|When Dr. Jackson {{called me}} to speak {{on the rights of}} the {{individual}} I told him he probably had the wrong person because I am an individual and I believe my company is an organization very prone to say 2 ̆ 2 what is, is and you 2 ̆ 7 ve got to go on with it. 2 ̆ 2 If I 2 ̆ 7 d have heard some of the talks here today before he called me, I wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be here at all, because I 2 ̆ 7 m not sure what individual rights there are left! So let me change this thing around a little bit and state that instead of speaking of the rights of the individual I 2 ̆ 7 d like to speak about the cooperation that we can achieve between the commercial pest control operator and regulatory authorities. I have to look at this thing primarily from the point of view of the pest control operator. The question: 2 ̆ 2 Is this problem one we can control within a complete framework of federal authority and state authority, conservation, Audubon, and everything else? Well, not really. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> that we 2 ̆ 7 d better be very, very careful about what we teach our man to say. If we teach him to say too much, I 2 ̆ 7 m afraid he might reach the error of our very high judicial authorities, and pest control for birds will be in much the same kind of situation as criminal control. We 2 ̆ 7 ll probably have to get permission from the bullies before we can conduct any control measures. Really, I think in commercial pest control, there are three areas we have to consider. One, of course is regulation that includes state, federal, municipal, or whatever domain may be involved. Second, is the commercial aspect of what we do. This may include the chemicals from the commercial companies, the cost of application, the price we have to pay for the material, and, of course, a moderating effect of what the competitor gets for the same type job. Third, is this individual right that we mentioned. In any commercial work we do, I think we must consider the individual right of our customer, the rights of the neighbors adjacent to our customer, and any others in the community who might be interested...|$|E
40|$|Against {{the odds}} CUE: In The Gambia?s Kombo district, land-grabbing for {{settlement}} purposes is {{the order of}} the day. Yet one community there has gone against all the odds. With assistance and support from the Department of Forest Services, they have claimed their rights to their traditional forest, and resolved to preserve it for future generations. Two years ago the Jabang Kunda clan created the Falaa Community Forest Park, a protected area of about four square kilometres. They also established a management committee to enforce rules about how the forest could be used. Now the entire clan, young and old, men and women, are involved in management and conservation of the park, and those who break the rules are fined. Ismaila Senghore spoke to Momodou Bojang, the head of the management committee, about why the clan had decided to claim their rights, and how they are both using the forest and protecting it for the future. IN:		?We are right here in ? OUT:		? benefit of our future generation. DUR?N	 4 ? 33 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ismaila Senghore reporting from The Gambia. Transcript Senghore	We are right here in the Falaa Community Forest Park, and it is situated just about a kilometre or so in the outskirts of the village of Jamburr, towards the west. This place, just the air that you breathe in here, and the trees that you see around, and of course the singing birds will tell you it is a natural forest that really needs preservation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons that might have lead the Jabang Kunda clan to conserve this forest of theirs. But as we have Mr. Momodou Bojang, who {{is the head of the}} management team here, I would like to ask him some of the reasons that lead the clan to conserve this forest. Mr. Bojang. Bojang	[Vernac. ] We were greatly inspired to take up this community forest initiative, because if you look at our environment, the natural forest is dying out completely, and we should try to conserve that little remaining natural forest that we have, at least for the benefit of our future children. That being the case, this has motivated us to do all that we can to make sure that natural things in the forest, such as animals, which our forefathers were seeing, and ourselves are seeing, to make sure that they still remain in the forest for the benefit of our children in the future. Senghore	What conservation and management practices do you carry out on the forest? Bojang	[Vernac. ] First of all, we make all effort to make sure that the forest is being protected against fire by making a firebelt around the forest. Senghore	How do you ensure that whatever you extract from the forest, you replace adequately, to ensure the regeneration and conservation of the forest? Bojang	[Vernac. ] After cutting some trees we replace them with beneficial trees such as malaina, mahogany and other trees, to replace them in the forest. Senghore	What are the resources that you expect this forest can generate when it is in full operation? Bojang	[Vernac] In the long run, if the forest is well developed in the future, when all animals and birds, some tree species and wild fruits will be available in the forest, and that can encourage eco-tourism in the area, and in our community in particular. Senghore	Now what kind of support have you received from either government, or from whatever source it might have come from? Bojang	[Vernac. ] The Department of Forestry do assist us in bringing seedlings, malaina seedlings, cashew-nut seedlings and also in providing us with some skills and techniques in how to bring up a community forest, during the process. Senghore	How far do you think you reserve the rights of ownership of your forest, and how does that right affect your inspiration in your management activities? Bojang	[Vernac. ] With the concept of community forest, the land belongs to the community of Jamburr, and more so to our clan, and this has been testified by our surrounding people, all confirm that this land belongs to us. It has been documented by the Department of Forestry Services that the land belongs to us as a community forest. This has encouraged us as we are now assured of the total ownership of the land, and we now embark on developing the land to make it a successful community forest. Senghore	Finally Mr. Bojang, do you think others would like to emulate your example because of your success? Bojang	The only advice I would have for the entire country and the community at large is, let everyone endeavour to at least make sure that we conserve the little remaining forest that we have in our environment, for the benefit of our future generation. End of track. In The Gambia?s Kombo district land-grabbing for settlement is the norm. However, one community has stood against this, asserting their traditional rights to their forest, and carrying out extensive conservation work to preserve it for future generations...|$|E
