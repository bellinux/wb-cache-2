25|$|The {{equation}} {{given by}} Fuss' theorem, giving the relation among the radius of a bicentric quadrilateral's inscribed circle, the radius of its circumscribed circle, {{and the distance}} between the centers of those circles, can be expressed as a quadratic equation for which {{the distance between the}} two circles' centers in terms of their radii is one of the solutions. The other solution of the same equation in terms of the relevant radii gives the distance between the circumscribed circle's center and the center of the <b>excircle</b> of an ex-tangential quadrilateral.|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} an <b>excircle</b> is the {{intersection}} of the internal bisector of one angle (at vertex A, for example) and the external bisectors of the other two.

Because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector, it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three <b>excircle</b> centers form an orthocentric system.|$|E

We give {{a simple}} {{construction}} of the Apollonius circle without di-rectly invoking the <b>excircles.</b> This follows from a computation of the coordi-nates of the centers of similitude of the Apollonius circle with some basic circles associated with a triangle. We also find a circle orthogonal to the five circles, circumcircle, nine-point circle, excentral circle, radical circle of the <b>excircles,</b> and the Apollonius circle. 1. The Apollonius circle of a triangle The Apollonius circle of a triangle is the circle tangent internally {{to each of the}} three <b>excircles.</b> Yiu [5] has given a {{construction of the}} Apollonius circle as the in-versive image of the nine-point circle in the radical circle of the <b>excircles,</b> and the coordinates of its center Q. It is known that this radical circle has center the Spieker center S and radius ρ = 12 r 2 + s 2. See, for example, [6, Theorem 4]. Ehrmann [1] found that this center can be constructed as the intersection of the Brocard axis and the line joining S to the nine-point center N. See Figure 1. A proof of this fact was given in [2], where Grinberg and Yiu showed that the Apollonius circle is a CB...|$|R
