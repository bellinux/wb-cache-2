25|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their <b>hose</b> <b>couples</b> failed to fit Baltimore hydrants. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.|$|R
5000|$|Holedall (Scovill/Rostra) {{internally}} expanded <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> is {{used primarily}} on fuel oil hose applications, where a full flow is required. [...] They are installed with special hydraulic drawbar machinery, using special pull plugs.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} rebreather itself. The rebreather {{must have}} at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder; many have two and some have more cylinders. Due to the lower gas {{consumption}} of rebreathers, these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open-circuit dives. Rebreathers may use internal cylinders, or may also be supplied from [...] "off-board" [...] cylinders, which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather, but connected to it by a flexible <b>hose</b> and <b>coupling</b> and usually carried side slung.|$|R
50|$|The Guillemin {{symmetrical}} clutch, {{also called}} Guillemin coupling, {{is widely used}} in France and in Belgium to <b>couple</b> <b>hoses</b> and resembles a DSP coupling, which is used in firefighting. It can be fastened by hand, {{but it is also}} possible to use a tricoise wrench. It has quarter-turn closing and is sexless (symmetrical). It may be fabricated from aluminum, stainless steel, brass or polypropylene. The standard for this kind of coupling is EN14420-8/NF E 29-572, and {{there is a kind of}} special standard DIN14420-8 for unique assemblies with ferrule and safety clamp.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> is a {{connector}} {{on the end}} of a hose to connect (or couple) it with another hose or with a tap or a hose appliance, such as an irrigation sprinkler. It is usually made of steel, brass, stainless steel, aluminium or plastic.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} paleo- climatic and {{environmental}} changes over northwest Africa {{by focusing on}} the Senegal region and the Gulf of Guinea. Emphasis was placed on the timing of past climate changes, the frequency of occurrence, and regional impact. Possible shifts in the position of the intertropical conversion zone (ITCZ) were also investigated. A multi proxy approach integrating rock and environmental magnetic parameters diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy, color reflectance and climate modeling experiments was employed. The results show that a climatic boundary which certainly reflects the southward shift of the northern limit of summer position of the ITCZ existed between 13 and 12 Ã ï¿½Ã Â°N during the last glacial. The West African monsoon varied at D O times-scales at 12 Ã ï¿½Ã Â°N, demonstrating that drier conditions occurred further south of the Sahel than previously reported. A fresh water <b>hosing</b> experiment using <b>coupled</b> climate model experiment suggested that the North Atlantic sea surface temperature and West African climate are linked by shifts in the position of the monsoon trough and the mid tropospheric African Easterly jet. The cooling of the North Atlantic sea surface is directly linked to the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturing Circulation. Further more, climate change regulated the influx of magnetic minerals and post depositional alteration in the Senegalese sediments. Interglacial showed lower concentrations of magnetic particles, with high concentration of euhedral and framboidal pyrite. Wind derived sediments dominated the glacial with hematite and goethite prominent at these intervals as a result of increase input of Saharan dust. This studies shows that climate over this region varies at different times scales and is interconnected with global climatic signals...|$|R
50|$|Camlocks {{also called}} cam and groove couplings, are {{a kind of}} <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> used to rapidly connect and {{disconnect}} fittings on piping or hose, they {{come in a variety of}} materials to be used with different media and a variety of sizes to accommodate hose or piping diameter.|$|E

His fiancee Wendy Von Huben, 16 years old, was raped, strangled, suffocated manually and with duct tape, and buried in a shallow grave inSumter County, Florida.|$|E
50|$|An {{expansion}} ring fire <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> {{is commonly}} used on lay-flat fire hose. It {{has the advantage of}} providing no flow restriction, as the expansion ring is expanded to match the inner diameter of the hose. It is installed with special machinery using a drawbar expander. In the United States, it is most commonly supplied with NST (NH) threads.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Air King" [...] {{universal}} air <b>hose</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "Chicago style" [...] fitting, is malleable iron or brass [...] "quarter turn" [...] "sexless coupling" [...] usually found on large pneumatic tools like jackhammers. The fitting is considered [...] "universal", because a common two-lug head is used on all sizes ranging from 0.25 to 1 in.|$|E
5000|$|A cam and groove is a {{quick connect}} fluid {{transfer}} <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> that consists of a male [...] "adapter" [...] and female [...] "coupler". The adapter has a groove on the outside that is engaged by the [...] "cam arms" [...] {{on the outside of}} the coupler to effect a seal against the gasket inside the [...] "coupler". They are commonly used for petroleum or chemical applications.|$|E
5000|$|Storz {{is a type}} of <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> {{invented by}} Carl August Guido Storz in 1882 that connects using {{interlocking}} hooks and flanges. Amongst other uses, it has been widely employed on fire hoses in firefighting applications. It is the standard coupling on fire hoses in Portugal, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Israel, and Greece. [...] It is also widely used in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The National Fire Protection Association {{adopted a}} {{national}} standard for fire hydrant and hose connections. However, inertia remained. Conversion {{was slow and}} still remains incomplete. One hundred years after the Baltimore Fire, only 18 of the 48 most populous American cities {{were reported to have}} national standard fire hydrants. Hose incompatibility contributed to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991: although the standard <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> has 2.5 in diameter, Oakland's hydrants had 3 in couplings.|$|E
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> (NST).|$|E
40|$|Conventional dry-disconnects {{routinely}} leak up to 15 cc {{of process}} fluid after every transfer and require catch buckets and costly cleanups. The Dry Link System, by Victaulic, solves {{this problem by}} implementing a <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> assembly with a drip free design. This pipe connection technology {{is proving to be}} a highly versatile solution when {{there is a need to}} transfer volatile and/or toxic fluids through a series of hoses or pipes...|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove <b>hose</b> <b>coupling</b> to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the cam levers are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the coupling halves, is to ensure that the coupling halves are properly aligned before the cam levers can be locked into position...|$|E
