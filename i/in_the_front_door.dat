5|$|Somehow King walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of {{the jail}} {{and a few}} minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
25|$|The Museum at Casa Armstrong Poventud {{presents}} the latest architectural and artistic taste in vogue {{at the end}} of the 19th century in Europe. For example, heavy use of glass on doors and windows. The glass decor used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the residence, for instance, is almost identical to those used in the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in England years earlier. The floral and natural motifs in the residence, are also characteristic of those comprising the new artistic expression of the Victorian Era evident in Europe and the United States in the first decades of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|The synagogue {{was built}} by a Reform Jewish {{congregation}} in 1898. It is a wood-frame building, with clapboard siding, keyhole windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> {{and a pair of}} octagonal towers topped by onion domes.|$|R
50|$|In Australia tourers {{may have}} two or four doors. The belt lines of tourers were often lowered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> to give <b>the</b> car a more {{sporting}} character. and would then be named sports tourers.|$|R

500|$|The Earps and a posse {{tracked the}} men down and arrested Luther King, who confessed {{he had been}} holding the reins while Bill Leonard, Harry [...] "The Kid" [...] Head, and Jim Crain robbed the stage. They arrested King and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail, but somehow King walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and almost {{immediately}} out the back door.|$|E
500|$|Several {{shots were}} exchanged: {{the house was}} riddled with bullets, but the whites did not {{overtake}} it. [...] The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who {{had been shot in}} the eye. Two white men, C. P. [...] "Poly" [...] Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and Andrews was behind him. At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{cross is}} now {{displayed}} {{at the start of}} the recently re-arranged Medieval galleries (<b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> right down stairs).|$|R
60|$|And even as {{he spoke}} a key turned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> I knew it was Aunt Emma, come in from her marketing.|$|E
60|$|At that moment, before Ralph could reply, a key {{was heard}} to turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> {{and a second}} later the squire's son strode into the house.|$|E
6000|$|The rough {{exterior}} and latent kindness of Uncle Lot were quite a spirit-stirring study; and when tea was over, {{as he and}} Grace happened to be standing together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> he broke forth,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Mitchell gave GM {{designers}} {{the assignment}} of combining Rolls Royce and Ferrari styling cues to create Buick's classic 1963 Riviera. According to a popular story, Mitchell {{got the idea for}} <b>the</b> Riviera <b>in</b> Paris. He had originally envisaged the design for Cadillac Division, as a new La Salle, [...] "a baby Cadillac". The Riviera also featured frameless glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> giving hardtops an even sleeker look.|$|R
50|$|Parking discs can be {{obtained}} from filling station shops, and many gift and card shops also sell parking discs. The cheap paper parking discs go for less than one Euro. Big European car rental companies such as Europcar and Sixt lend their vehicles equipped with a parking disc. These are commonly left in places such as the two side bags <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and <b>the</b> inside of the cover of the car log book.|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be a sort of scuffling noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back passage, as she was coming <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> But there was nobody there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Obviously!" [...] said Mrs. Hignett, {{withdrawing}} her fascinated {{gaze from}} the ragged hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> the cost of repairing which she had been mentally assessing. [...] "We must send for the police at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it," [...] cried Eddie. [...] "The {{minute they}} get {{money for the}} pay I'll hike. Tell me your name. I'll ask her ef she remembers you when I get home. Gee! but I wish I was walkin' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> now." ...|$|E
60|$|His meditations were {{interrupted}} {{by the sound of}} a key <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and a second later a small, anxious figure entered the room and, leaning against the table, strove to get its breath. The process was not helped by the alarming distension of Mr. Gribble's figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring him <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and {{out at the}} back," [...] said Perry. [...] "Fine times these, when a man {{dare not}} open his own yard-gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, Tuppence, {{how could}} he be? This door's open into the hall. No one could have come <b>in</b> by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> without our seeing and hearing him." ...|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} L50 Carry {{debuted in}} May 1972, {{followed by a}} new Carry Van <b>in</b> August. <b>The</b> new model echoes Giugiaro's design, but without ventilation windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and with a more traditional appearance. Headlights are now round, while the van version receives a more square rear body and with a sliding rear side door. The engine is a water-cooled design (L50), otherwise similar to the previous engine but now with [...] Max load was back up to 350 kg.|$|R
60|$|John {{gave the}} team {{up to the}} hired hand (who stared at Rose with {{wondering}} eyes) and then they walked upon the front porch and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> It was new--so new it glistened everywhere and was full of the fragrance of new lumber and the odor of paint.|$|E
60|$|The {{street was}} empty when she {{inserted}} the little key <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> There {{was not a}} soul there to see her step in as it swung open and then softly, noiselessly, but without any conscious effort of hers, closed again behind her. She held her breath and looked around.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, [...] "that {{that man}} must have one. I am safe while I am there, for I have had bolts fitted everywhere, and a {{pane of glass}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> But I am always afraid that he may get in while I am away. Look! Is that some one coming out?" ...|$|E
60|$|Frank, much to Mrs. Spencer's dismay, marched boldly <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> {{upon his}} return. She pounced {{on him and}} whisked him out of sight into the supper room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} walking {{home with a}} jay, and we found Alan trying to get <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> with his key, and I {{introduced}} him to the jay." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{looked all}} around the old building, but nobody was <b>in</b> sight. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> stood wide open, and they rightly surmised that the others had taken their {{departure}} that way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes,' he said, eagerly. 'You sent me {{words of}} {{greeting}} that held up my faith; and, above all, {{when we read}} those books at Coombe, you put the key of comfort in my hand, and I never quite lost it. Miss May,' he added, as Dr. May's latch-key was heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> 'if ever I come to any good, I owe it to you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{ten o'clock}} that night I sets down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and pulls off my boots {{a while in}} the cool breeze, while Mrs. Hicks was fixing around in the room. Right soon the light went out inside; and I sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes. And then I heard Mrs. Hicks call out, 'Ain't you coming in soon, Lem?' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{moved at}} the September quarter, and a slight, but temporary, {{improvement}} in Mrs. Gribble's health took place. Her cheeks flushed {{and her eyes}} sparkled over new curtains and new linoleum. The tiled hearths, and stained glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> filled her with a deep and solemn thankfulness. The only thing that disturbed her {{was the fact that}} Mr. Gribble, to avoid wasting money over necessaries, contrived to spend an unduly large portion on personal luxuries.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{smiled with}} perfect {{knowledge}} and sympathy. She {{was on his}} side; and she knew, besides, how much it meant to have the hired man come <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then I {{told our}} names, and <b>in</b> an instant <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> opened.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1974, <b>the</b> B20E/F engine {{switched}} {{from using the}} Bosch D-Jetronic to the K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system. Also, several safety changes were introduced including a fuel tank that was located close to the transaxle to protect it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a rear-end collision, and larger bumpers that protruded more from the body. <b>The</b> quarter-light windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> were removed {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> improvements <b>in</b> ventilation inside <b>the</b> car, and small anodised aluminium strips were added {{to the bottom of the}} side windows.|$|R
