5|$|Of the conspirators, only Booth was {{completely}} successful {{in carrying out}} <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot. He shot Lincoln once {{in the back of}} the head, and the President died the next morning. Seward was severely wounded but recovered, and Vice President Johnson was never attacked at all.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall {{ended in a}} hung jury in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Magnus had a son, Haakon Toresfostre, who was {{probably}} born {{the same year}} that Magnus died. Haakon went on to claim what he considered <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom (after his father) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died, and shared the kingdom with his cousin Magnus Barefoot (son of Olaf Kyrre). Similar to the reign of his father, Haakon's reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095.|$|E

50|$|The {{movie is}} a parody on Western mystical thrillers and horror films, in particular—1961 film The Pit and the Pendulum. A {{musician}} from the symphony orchestra reads an English thriller novel during the concert, while performing <b>his</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Georges Bizet's opera Carmen. The book makes so strong an impression on him that he imagines himself to be the novel's protagonist, Sir Hannibal Morris, an owner of a huge Gothic castle. Then come mysterious murders and disappearances, intrigues, kidnappings, and love.|$|R

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Shakira roller-skating with many fans {{surrounding}} her. After roaming about the city, including numerous scenes of dancing, she publicly changes her wardrobe and hitches {{a ride on}} a motorbike. Further on, she dances and jumps into a fountain. During the next verse, she is seen belly dancing with {{a man by the}} beach and, {{near the end of the}} video, she dives into the sea along with many fans and celebrates. Scenes of Shakira dancing wearing a gold triangle bikini and gold sequined pants are also interspersed throughout the video. Dizzee Rascal also makes an appearance during <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges {{through the pages of}} the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene because he {{felt that it was}} not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E

5|$|William Rufus {{crossed into}} Normandy {{to take the}} war to Robert in 1094, and when {{progress}} stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly {{at the request of}} the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court. In 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary custody of <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a Chilean landing, the allied forces planned to {{counter-attack}} the Chilean forces in a pincer movement involving advances from the north (Daza's forces coming from Arica) and from the south (Buendia's forces coming from Iquique). But while Peruvian forces marched northwards as planned after the fall of Pisagua, Daza, coming from Arica, decided in Camarones (44km from Pisagua) to give up <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counter-attack and return to Arica.|$|E
25|$|Wizards and witches who are Muggle-born, or are half-bloods (of mixed muggle and magical parentage) find {{it easier}} (or even commonplace) to {{integrate}} into Muggle society and take on Muggle trends as they are predisposed to Muggle ways growing up.

25|$|Meanwhile, Francis I {{initiated}} the hostilities with Charles V on 20 July 1542, and kept with <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement by laying siege at Perpignan and attacking Flanders.

25|$|Donnchadh {{was forced}} to form strong ties with the great Robert Stewart, who was the second son of King Robert II by his first wife Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan, and who ruled much of Scotland. In 1392, Donnchadh met Robert at Inchmurrin and agreed to marry his {{daughter}} Isabella to Robert's son, Muiredach if Robert could secure him the Mormaerdom. As Domhnall was heirless, the deal ensured that the Mormaerdom would pass to the Stewarts upon Donnchadh's death. It took much of the 1390s, but nevertheless Robert managed to secure <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bargain.|$|E

25|$|Gideon Welles (July 1, 1802 – February 11, 1878) was the United States Secretary of the Navy from 1861 to 1869, {{a cabinet}} post {{he was given}} after {{supporting}} Lincoln in the 1860 election. Although opposed to the Union blockade of Southern ports, he duly carried out <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anaconda Plan, largely sealing off the Confederate coastline and preventing the exchange of cotton for war supplies. This {{is viewed as a}} major cause of Union victory in the Civil War, and his achievement in expanding the Navy almost tenfold was widely praised. Welles was also instrumental in the Navy's creation of the Medal of Honor.|$|E

The banker decided to substitute counterfeit banknotes. Even so, the sight of their incineration was so unnerving {{that he could not}} accomplish <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tryst. Another source, however, states that the courtesan burned the notes, one by one, during her sexual congress with Gaiffe, who bet his friends {{he would be able to}} access her favors without payment -- and so he did, because the money was fake.|$|E
25|$|Alexander quietly moved <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army {{upstream}} {{and then}} traversed {{the river in}} utmost secrecy, using ‘skin floats filled with hay’ as well as ‘smaller vessels cut in half, the thirty oared galleys into three’. Furthermore, Craterus engaged in frequent feints that he may cross the river. As a result, Porus, 'no longer expecting a sudden attempt under cover of darkness, was lulled into a sense of security.' Alexander mistakenly landed on an island, but soon crossed to the other side. Porus perceived his opponent's maneuver and sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son, also named Porus, to fight them off, hoping {{that he would be}} able to prevent his crossing. By chance a storm occurred that night which drowned the sounds of the crossing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{that turned}} out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally {{registered}} as 100% owner of Voda Voda, a bottled water brand previously owned by businessman Vojin Đorđević. That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a gentlemen's agreement they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the Serbian Business Registers Agency. The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's Si company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill <b>his</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.|$|E
