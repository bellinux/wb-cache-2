40|$|High power bipolar {{transistors}} often have multiple emitters, to achieve high currents, and {{efficient use of}} the whole emitter area. The emitters experience high current densities and are self-heated above the ambient temperature, leading to concerns about thermal run-away and damage to the device. Here we use a multi-emitter SiGe HBT, with multiple emitter contacts, to examine the temperature distribution in the emitters in such devices. We have measured the temperature increase in different emitters by biasing one emitter {{at a time and}} using the other base 2 ̆ 013 <b>emitter</b> <b>junctions</b> as thermometers. We show that use of a selectively implanted collector does not alter the temperature increase or thermal coupling between the emitters. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|The UJT {{is biased}} with a {{positive}} voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop {{along the length of}} the device. When the emitter voltage is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes conductivity modulation which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the emitter terminal. This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.|$|E
50|$|When a split supply (dual power supply) is available, this biasing circuit is {{the most}} effective, and {{provides}} zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load. The negative supply VEE is used to forward-bias the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> through RE. The positive supply VCC is used to reverse-bias the collector junction. Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of HEBT architecture, {{compared to the}} HBT is a simplified fabrication process for the emitter-base junction. In particular the HEBT does not require as tight parametric control during epitaxial growth, that equivalent abrupt or graded emitter structures might. This is very important as it is evident from scanning ion mass spectrometry data that out-diffusion base dopant into the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> is difficult to control, as the base is, in general, very highly doped {{in order to enhance}} performance.|$|E
50|$|In this topology, {{there is}} little {{difference}} between the Jones cell and the translinear multiplier. In both forms, two differential amplifier stages are formed by emitter-coupled transistor pairs (Q1/Q4, Q3/Q5) whose outputs are connected (currents summed) with opposite phases. The <b>emitter</b> <b>junctions</b> of these amplifier stages are fed by the collectors of a third differential pair (Q2/Q6). The output currents of Q2/Q6 become emitter currents for the differential amplifiers. Simplified, the output current of an individual transistor is given by ic=gm vbe. Its transconductance gm is (at T=300 k) about gm=40 IC. Combining these equations gives ic=40 IC vbe,lo. However, IC here is given by vbe,rf gm,rf. Hence ic=40 vbe,lo vbe,rf gm,rf, which is a multiplication of vbe,lo and vbe,rf. Combining the two difference stages output currents yields four-quadrant operation.|$|R

40|$|Many {{solar cell}} {{structures}} contain regions where the <b>emitter</b> pn <b>junction</b> {{borders on the}} surface. If the surface is not well passivated, {{a large amount of}} recombination occurs in such regions. This type of recombination is influenced by the electrostatics of both the pn junction and the surface, and hence it is different from the commonly described recombination phenomena occurring in the pn junction within the bulk. We developed a two-dimensional model for the recombination mechanisms occurring in <b>emitter</b> pn <b>junctions</b> bordering on surfaces. The model is validated by reproducing the experimental IV curves of specially designed silicon solar cells. It is shown under which circumstances a poor surface passivation, near where the pn junction borders on the surface, reduces the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage. The model can be applied to many other types of solar cells...|$|R
5000|$|The UJT {{has three}} terminals: an emitter (E) and two bases (B1 and B2) {{and so is}} {{sometimes}} known a [...] "double-base diode". The base is formed by a lightly doped n-type bar of silicon. Two ohmic contacts B1 and B2 are attached at its ends. The emitter is of p-type and is heavily doped; this single PN junction gives the device its name. The resistance between B1 and B2 when the emitter is open-circuit is called interbase resistance. The <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> is usually located closer to base-2 (B2) than base-1 (B1) so that the device is not symmetrical, because a symmetrical unit does not provide optimum electrical characteristics {{for most of the}} applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{voltage divider}} is formed using {{external}} resistors R1 and R2. The voltage across R2 forward biases the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction.</b> By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating {{point of the}} transistor can be made independent of β. In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current. However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature (for example) so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages {{by the use of}} resistors in certain patterns. By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much.|$|E
50|$|PN diodes {{also have}} {{transient}} behaviors {{that might be}} of concern with the design. The capacitance of a PN diode between anode and cathode is inversely proportional to the reverse voltage, growing as it approaches zero volts and into forward bias. There is also a recovery concern where the current will not decrease immediately when it is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. In {{the case of the}} diode OR if two or more of the inputs are at the 1 level and one switches to 0 it will cause a glitch or increase in current in the diodes that remain at 1. This can cause a short term dip in the output voltage. In practice if the diode logic gate drives a transistor inverter, as it usually does, and the diode and transistor are of similar construction the transistor will have a similar base collector capacitance that is amplified by the transistor gain so that it will be too slow to pass the glitch. Only when the diode is of a much slower construction will it become any concern at all. In one unusual design small selenium diode discs were used with germanium transistors. The recovery time of the very slow selenium diodes caused a glitch on the inverter output. It was fixed by placing a selenium diode across the base <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> of the transistor making it “think” it was a selenium transistor (if there could ever be one).|$|E

A backside implant before init ial oxidation of the wafers wil l minimize the density of epitaxial defects for both arsenic diffused or im-planted buried layers. For dittused buried layers, the backside damage offers only min imum improvement in yield because of the gettering action of the diffused arsenic itself.
