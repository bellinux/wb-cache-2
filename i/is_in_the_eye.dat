25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the beholder. People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) {{to be cool}} based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something {{is perceived to be}} cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E

But, in criminal cases, the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused.

2500|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that beauty <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the beholder. [...] Sircello’s {{philosophy}} runs counter to this maxim. [...] He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. [...] His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made {{there is something about}} the object that is thought to be beautiful. [...] For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, {{this is due to the}} quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. [...] Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. [...] Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the beach}} at Sidmouth, about noon {{one day in the}} last week of November, a day of almost {{brilliant}} sunshine despite the season, with a light dry west wind crinkling the surface of the sea, Mary and Constance, with Fan between them, were seated on a heap of shingle sheltered from the wind by a sloping bank. Constance, with hands folded over the closed book on her lap, sat idly gazing on the blue expanse of water, watching the white little wave-crests that formed only to vanish so quickly. The quiet restful life she had experienced since Merton's death had had its effect; her form had partially recovered its roundness, her face something of that rich brown tint that had given a peculiar character to her beauty; the melancholy in her tender eyes was no longer [...] "o'erlaid with black," [...] but was more like the clear dark of early morning that tells of the passing of night and of the long day that is to be. She was like the Constance of the old days at Eyethorne, and yet unlike; something had been lost, something gained; for Nature, archaeologist and artist, is wiser than man in her restorations, restoring never on the old vanished lines. She was changed, but unhappy experience had left no permanent bitterness in her heart, nor made her world-weary, nor cynical, nor discontented; life's unutterable sadness had only served to deepen her love and widen her sympathies. And this was pure gain, compensation for the loss of that which had vanished and would not return--the virgin freshness when the tender early light <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and the lips are dewy, and no flower has yet perished in the heart.|$|E
