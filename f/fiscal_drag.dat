However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag.</b> Corporation tax fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for small businesses.

To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: [...] "Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners {{at a cost of}} £3bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non savings income".|$|E

40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. · The world economy will recover during 2010 and 2011 thanks to ultra-low key interest rates in industrial countries and to the strong growth in emerging markets economies. In the euro area, however, the phasing out of expansive fiscal policies and <b>fiscal</b> consolidation will <b>drag</b> down demand; rising exports will be the main driver of the recovery. Internal demand will have a positive (although small) contribution to growth in 2011. We expect euro area GDP to grow around 1. 2 % and 1. 6 % during 2010 and 2011, respectively. · Due to rising exports, the industrial sector will resume positive growth in the short run but the intensity of the recovery will be moderate and insufficient to compensate the sharp fall of 2009 : at the end of 2011, the industrial production index is expected to be still 10 % below its pre-crisis levels. · For the first time in its short history, the euro area is struggling with a crisis of confidence in the sustainability of the monetary union. Our forecast is based on the assumption that, with the help of the program adopted at the beginning of April, Greece will be able to meet its financial obligations and will carry out the required reforms. However, downside risks are high. One adverse effect of the current situation that might gain importance is that the interest rate burden of firms and households could increase quickly in spite of low key interest rates. This will occur if higher yields for government bonds take effect on the financing costs for private agents; this is a cause for concern because debt ratios for firms, but also for consumers, have been on a rising trend for years in the euro area and are now on record levels. · Inflation expectations in the euro area continue to be very low. Forecasts were revised downwards after the weak HICP data of January and February. We now expect HICP inflation to be 1. 2 % in 2010 and 1. 3 % in 2011. The only risks for inflation come from oil and raw materials prices which are showing signs of significant increases in the world markets. Moreover, the movements in the currency markets that have been protecting the euro area from price fluctuations of crude oil are changing. The price in euros of Brent oil has increased by more than 12 % from December 2009...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> {{happens when}} the government's net fiscal {{position}} (spending minus taxation) fails to cover the net savings desires of the private economy, also called the private economy's spending gap (earnings minus spending and private investment).

50|$|Tax laws {{might not}} be {{accurately}} indexed to inflation. For example, some tax laws may ignore inflation completely.

40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> {{refers to}} the effect that {{inflation}} has on average tax rates. If tax allowances are not increased in line with inflation, and taxpayers ’ incomes increase with inflation, then they will be moved up into higher tax bands and so their tax bill will go up. In other words, <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> {{refers to the}} increase in tax revenue caused when the threshold of a tax is not increased in line with either inflation or earnings growth. In general, <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> refers to the process where tax thresholds are either not adjusted for inflation (nominal <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag),</b> or fail to keep pace with earnings growth (real <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag),</b> causing in either case an automatic rise in tax revenues. For instance, in a progressive tax system, a rise in inflation will cause wage earners to pay a higher proportion of their income in tax, even though their real wages are unchanged; this is nominal <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag.</b> On the other hands, real <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> occurs when all taxpayers pay a higher proportion of their income in taxation, as a result of rising real wages. In these circumstances, there is a rise in government tax revenues as a proportion of gross domestic product. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> creates uneven tax burden. Recently, OECD (2007) investigates the interaction between income, inflation and tax obligations in OECD countries. Notably, workers in several countries saw their nominal tax burden rise in response to high earnings growth. This phenomenon, known as “fiscal drag”, occurs in countrie...|$|E
40|$|Non-technical summary In recent years, {{politicians}} like to ascribe lower {{growth rates}} of tax revenues to globalization {{and the consequences of}} tax competition. Less interest is paid to another possible explanation: Inflation rates have decreased markedly in industrial countries. The phenomenon of inflation – even of a moderate level- boosting tax revenues is well known under the term “fiscal drag”. It is, however, important to differentiate between a real and a nominal type of <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> Nominal <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> can work the following way: With a progressive tax system {{and in the absence of}} perfect indexation, inflation shifts taxpayers into tax brackets with higher marginal tax rates. This so called “bracket creep ” leads to rising tax income ratios. Since with positive nominal growth this relationship holds even in the absence of any real growth, the phenomenon can be called “nominal fiscal drag”. The real type of <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> does not depend on inflation. “Real <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> ” exists if the tax income ratio reacts positively to an increasing real income. For economic thinking it is not very pleasant to accept the existence of nominal <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> since it implies the existence of some form of money illusion in the political system. There is, however, pervasive evidence of empirical psychology for widely spread money illusion. Money illusion in the contex...|$|E
40|$|Declining {{inflation}} rates {{might have}} negative consequences for tax revenues. Phenomena like the inflationary bracket creep in a progressive income tax system {{do not work}} any longer. With this background the paper analyzes the extent of <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag</b> for OECD countries since 1965. Some considerations {{on the role of}} money illusion and indexation in this context lay the theoretical base followed by a descriptive view on the relation between inflation, growth and tax revenues in the past decades. A framework is presented that allows for the classification of fiscal structures with regard to the type of <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag.</b> The subsequent econometric analysis is performed for total and disaggregated government revenues. The results reveal that an end of inflation would {{have a negative impact on}} tax revenues for a number of OECD countries. The results also back theoretical considerations on inflation?s impact on different kinds of taxes: This impact tends to be positive for individual income taxes and social security contributions, it is neutral or negative for corporate income, property and indirect taxation.

This constant population methodology aims at isolating the «pure» redistributive effect of the tax legislation.

For the Italian case, it is shown that the additional redistributive outcome displayed by changes of tax laws between 1995 and 2000 is only ¼ of the total change of the redistributive impact in the same period and is outweighed by the effect of inflationary <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag...</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years {{scholars}} have argued that key to achieving sustainability are the paradigms held by organisational leaders who make strategic and operational decisions.

This paper reports on an empirical study that explored the views of leaders of a series of environmentally focused organisations, linking their views to the paradigm scheme of Gladwin et al., (1995) in an attempt to understand how their rhetoric is aligned to different paradigms. Findings suggest that interviewees lean towards sustaincentrism and or ecocentrism in their rhetoric but that they also support some anthropocentric assumptions. In support some simple practices brought forward by the sample as helpful in embedding sustainability awareness within their organisations are also highlighted.

Projections from two separate models, dealing with social expenditures and income tax and GST revenue, are used. The results suggest that the modest projected required increase in the overall average tax rate over the next 50 years can be achieved automatically by adjusting income tax thresholds using an index of prices rather than wages. Based on evidence about the New Zealand tax system over the last 50 years, comparisons of average and marginal tax rates suggest that such an increase may be feasible and affordable.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the joint {{role of the}} elasticity of taxable income (the effect on taxable income of a tax rise) and the revenue elasticity (the effect on revenue {{of a change in}} taxable income) in influencing the revenue effects of tax rate changes. Traditionally, the revenue elasticity has been the central concept in examining <b>fiscal</b> <b>drag,</b> or obtaining local measures of tax progressivity. But it has an additional role {{in the context of the}} revenue effects of tax changes when incomes respond to rate changes. The elasticity of tax revenue with respect to a rate change is examined at both the individual and aggregate level. If there were no incentive effects, an equal proportional change in all marginal tax rates would produce the same proportional increase in total revenue — the elasticity is unity. This rapidly falls, at a linear rate, as the elasticity of taxable income increases. Illustrations are provided using the New Zealand income tax structures before and after the 2010 Budget, which reduced all rates while leaving income thresholds unchanged and, in particular, reduced the top marginal rate substantially. ...|$|E
