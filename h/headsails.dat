25|$|Speed was profit, and so {{in summer}} the sails were made of cotton, and in winter of flax. There were four sets of reefing points, with later designs {{encompassing}} roller-reefing, which although bringing its own boat handling issues meant that {{the chances of a}} broken boom crippling the boat were low. The size, scale and number of any <b>headsails</b> were a captain's personal choice, but were often be used to fool other pilots into thinking that they were being passed by a fishing boat, or as a signature to be recognised by approaching cargo boat captains.|$|E
2500|$|When used {{to refer}} to sailing boats, a cutter is a utility vessel, single-masted and with a small crew (as few as two but often five or more) fore-and-aft rigged, with two or more <b>headsails</b> and often a bowsprit. A cutter's mast may be set farther back than on a sloop. [...] Cutters most often found utility in coastal work, either as patrol, ferry, packet or light cargo.|$|E
2500|$|As Endymion was {{the fastest}} {{ship in the}} engagement(and {{possible}} {{in the whole world}} at the time) she was the only ship to catch up to President and engage her. [...] After a fierce fight lasting several hours, during which both ships were severely damaged(Endymion's <b>headsails</b> & President's hull), Decatur reluctantly surrendered to Endymion as there were four remaining British ships he would have to fight. Decatur's command suffered 35 men killed and 70 wounded, including Decatur himself who was wounded by a large flying splinter.|$|E
50|$|Furling <b>headsail</b> -a jib {{or other}} <b>headsail</b> that {{automatically}} rolls around a semi rigid forestay when a line is pulled. The lower {{section of the}} furling gear has a spring-loaded retrieval system that rolls up the <b>headsail.</b> These are often used in cruising boats or when a yacht is sailed short-handed. The operating lines are operated {{from the safety of}} the cockpit avoiding crew working on the exposed foredeck. On very large yachts the furling gear is attached to an electric motor for ease of use.|$|R

2500|$|Hansen, who {{was known}} for his use of clipper-style bows and soft lines, drew up a plan for the ship, to which Gunnar Knudsen made a few {{alterations}} to increase the carrying capacity by 50 register tons. [...] The ship's hull was to be built with steel plates with a controlled carbon content, which was advanced technology at the time, and would have a barque sail-plan, with three masts carrying a total of 26 sails, including topsails, staysails, <b>headsails</b> and gaff-rigged sails. [...] Construction took place at the shipyard Laxevaags Maskin- og Jernskibsbyggeri in Laksevåg, Bergen, and the ship was launched on 23 April 1890, costing 284,995 kroner in all. [...] The speech for the handing over of the ship was given by the shipping magnate Christian Michelsen, who was chairman of the Bergen company at the time and went on to become Norway's first Prime Minister after the dissolution of the Norwegian-Swedish union. [...] The ship was christened by Augusta Rafn, the young daughter of the ship's first captain, Hans Christian Rafn. [...] The ship was named Skomvær, after the newly built Skomvær Lighthouse southwest of Røstlandet, and launched in September of that year with a crew of 23 men.|$|E
60|$|At this moment, anchor {{broken out}} and <b>headsails</b> running up, Captain Van Horn, whose quick eye had missed no {{detail of the}} incident, with an order to the black {{helmsman}} turned to applaud Jerry.|$|E
60|$|My {{teeth were}} chattering. These {{operations}} of salvage had taken time, {{and it took}} us a further unconscionable time to cover the distance between us and the brig as she lay hove-to, her maintopsail aback and her <b>headsails</b> drawing.|$|E

60|$|Borckman and {{the black}} {{steersman}} echoed his words, and, as the wheel spun down, the Arangi, with the swiftness of a witch, rounded into the wind and attained a momentary even keel to the flapping of her <b>headsails</b> and a shifting of headsheets.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were making}} a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to save trouble. [...] "Squarerigger bellowin' fer his latitude," [...] said Long Jack. The {{dripping}} red <b>headsails</b> of a bark glided out of the fog, and the [...] "We're Here" [...] rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.|$|E

60|$|Her head swung slowly round, and {{the shaking}} canvas filled; she {{gathered}} way, {{and when her}} deck slanted the boulders were sliding past abeam. Coming round again, she left them astern, and drove forward swiftly into clear and sheltered water. Ten minutes afterward they ran the <b>headsails</b> down, and Aynsley ran her gently on to the beach. There {{she would have to}} stop until Engineer Saltom finished his repairs.|$|E
60|$|The art {{of sailing}} into a wind {{had not yet}} been invented, nor was there any fore-and-aft canvas, save for small <b>headsails</b> with which a vessel could be turned. Hence the English fleet had to take a long slant down channel to meet their enemies; but as the Spaniards coming before the wind were equally anxious to engage there was the less delay. With stately pomp and dignity, the two great fleets approached.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely {{was this}} {{finished}} when the spanker smashed across overhead, the <b>headsails</b> thundered {{with a sudden}} filling, and the great mainsail, with all the scope in the boom-tackle caused by Van Horn's giving of the sheet, came across and fetched up to tautness on the tackle with a crash that shook the vessel and heeled her violently to port. This second knock-down {{had come from the}} opposite direction, and it was mightier than the first.|$|E

60|$|She plunged {{once more}} into the shadow, but Frank could still see her more or less plainly--a tall, slanted mass of canvas flitting swiftly through the dusky blueness of the night. She edged close in with the reef, still {{carrying}} everything except her main gaff-topsail, and then as her <b>headsails</b> swept across the entrance the splash of a paddle reached the boys faintly through the clamor of the surf and they heard a hoarse shout.|$|E
60|$|For the ketch, {{under her}} spanker which had just then been flat-hauled, {{had come into}} the wind, {{emptying}} her after-sail and permitting her <b>headsails</b> to fill on the other tack. The Arangi was beginning to work back approximately over the course she had just traversed. And this meant that she was going back toward Jerry floundering in the sea. Thus, the balance, on which his life titubated, was inclined in his favour by the blunder of a black steersman.|$|E
60|$|They {{seized the}} chain {{and as it}} ran below a sharp, musical rattle rang out, for the hollow hull flung back the {{metallic}} clinking like a sounding board. When the cable was short-up, they grasped the halyards and the big gaff mainsail rose flapping up the mast. They set it {{and turned to the}} <b>headsails,</b> for though, strictly speaking, a sloop only carries one, the term is loosely applied in places, and as Vane had changed her rig there were two of them.|$|E

60|$|He {{scrambled}} {{towards the}} bowsprit, which, having lost its principal support, swayed upward, in peril of being torn {{away by the}} sagging jib. Vane, who first rounded up the boat into the wind, followed him; and for several minutes they had a struggle with the madly-flapping sail, before they flung it, bundled up, into the well. Then they ran in the bowsprit, and Vane felt glad that, although the craft had been rigged in the usual Western fashion, he had changed that by giving {{her a couple of}} <b>headsails</b> in place of one.|$|E
60|$|On this night, close-hauled, her big {{mainsail}} preposterously flattened down, her luffs pulsing emptily on {{the lift}} of each smooth swell, she was sliding an easy four knots {{through the water}} on the veriest whisper of a breeze. For an hour David Grief had been leaning on the rail at the lee fore-rigging, gazing overside at the steady phosphorescence of her gait. The faint back-draught from the <b>headsails</b> fanned his cheek and chest with a wine of coolness, {{and he was in}} an ecstasy of appreciation of the schooner's qualities.|$|E
60|$|It is bold {{water at}} the mouth of the bay; you can steer a ship about either sentinel, close enough to toss a biscuit on the rocks. Thus it chanced that, as the tattooed man sat dozing and dreaming, he was startled into {{wakefulness}} and animation by the appearance of a flying jib beyond the western islet. Two more <b>headsails</b> followed; and before the tattooed man had scrambled to his feet, a topsail schooner of some hundred tons had luffed about the sentinel, and was standing up the bay, close-hauled.|$|E
