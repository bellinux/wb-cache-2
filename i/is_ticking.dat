In 2002, Hewson received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the National University of Ireland for her work on environmental issues, particularly the Chernobyl Children's Project. Bono and Ali Hewson were given the Council of Fashion Designers of America board of directors' Special Tribute Award in 2007 for their humanitarian work via the Edun clothing line. Hewson was also voted Sexiest Celebrity Other Half in a 2008 poll by entertainment.ie.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or {{spin-offs}} released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, Super Monkey Ball has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 {{study conducted by the}} Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. Super Monkey Ball inspired Neverball, a free game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting [...] "who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when the clock <b>is</b> <b>ticking)</b> and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?" [...] In 2009, Edge ranked the game #39 on its list of [...] "The 100 Best Games To Play Today", stating [...] "Seeing its sturdy physics model being used to perform incredible acrobatic feats shows just how finely honed it is." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Christian Donlan described Super Monkey Ball as [...] "one of Sega's grade-A triumphs." ...|$|E

[...] However, Jude Rogers noted that the chorus lyrics [...] "We're on a timebomb, we might not last long, so let's just do it right now," [...] was a reference about sex.

2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when the clock <b>is</b> <b>ticking</b> {{and time is}} pressing, a player's intuition {{is most likely to}} let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E

By and by the tremulous tinkling of an aged piano reaches us from an adjoining chamber, and Aaron looks at me through his fingers, and I take a lightning glance at Mr. David, and he uncrosses his legs and rises, and sits down again. Aaron, in the most unconcerned way, proceeds to cut tobacco and rub it between his fingers, and I stretch out my legs and contemplate them with passionate approval. While we are thus occupied David has risen, and he is so thoroughly at his ease that he has begun to hum. He strolls round the kitchen, looking with sudden interest at the mantelpiece ornaments; he reads, for the hundredth time, the sampler on the wall. Next the clock engages his attention; it <b>is</b> <b>ticking,</b> and that seems to impress him as novel and curious. By this time he has reached the door; it opens to his touch, and in a fit of abstraction he leaves the room." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Economic {{threshold}} infestations of <b>ticks</b> <b>were</b> computed by equating {{the cost}} to the benefit of dipping. Both liveweight gain and disease control benefits were considered and a probability-based disease control benefit function was used. When only noninfectious <b>ticks</b> <b>were</b> present, the economic threshold based on liveweight gain <b>was</b> three <b>ticks</b> per calf using 1994 Zambian prices. For disease-infectious tick species, the threshold recommended dipping whenever any <b>ticks</b> <b>were</b> present. If disease control benefits are omitted, as in some past work, thresholds will be overstated and dipping recommendations understated when infectious <b>ticks</b> <b>are</b> present...|$|R
