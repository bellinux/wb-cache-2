5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface hardening {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the hardening structure {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The hardening structure formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the hardening structure. To produce the hardening structure would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface hardening samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While through hardening the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial hardening the hardening interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The depth of hardening zone of samples with through <b>hardening</b> <b>layers</b> is 0, 5 mm; the depth of hardening zone of partial hardening samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the through <b>hardening</b> <b>layers</b> is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial <b>hardening</b> <b>layers.</b> The metallographic analysis shows that the hardening zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the hardening structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grinding-hardening is a thermo-mechanical process {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} material removal and surface enhancement. However, there are difficulties {{in dealing with}} cylindrical workpieces, because of the complex 3 D-helical movement of the grinding-induced heat source. This paper investigates the effects of some key grinding parameters on the profile and microstructure variations of the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> generated by a traverse cylindrical grinding, both experimentally and numerically. It {{was found that the}} ratio of the longitudinal wheel feed to the rotational speed of the workpiece R is most influential on the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> profile. A larger R results in a thicker <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> but a more pronounced discontinuity of two adjacent hardening zones. Although a smaller R yields a relatively thinner <b>hardened</b> <b>layer,</b> the non-uniformity could be minimised by the overlapping of the grinding heating. The microstructure of the <b>hardened</b> <b>layer</b> can be altered by the tempering in subsequent grinding heating.
