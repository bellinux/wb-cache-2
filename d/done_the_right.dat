Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{themes were}} more general. [...] "Lady Killer" [...] {{has been cited}} as having a {{considerable}} thrash metal influence, and its topic of revenge against a serial killer is comparable to songs such as Iron Maiden's [...] "Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Judas Priest's [...] "The Ripper". The song emerged when the band attempted to [...] "write a theme song for Jack the Ripper," [...] according to Heppner, and its distinctive intro was created by generating feedback on a 1976 Gibson SG run through a 1970s MXR rack flanger. [...] "The Gem" [...] portrays the apocalypse as being {{a good thing because}} it wipes humanity off the planet; whoever sets it in motion (Heppner explained as by [...] "open Pandora's Box") is hailed as a hero for having <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing. [...] "Communicating Via-Eyes" [...] is [...] "the werewolf song", as Heppner put it; he wrote much of that song while on tour with Megadeth in the UK.

500|$|Filmcritic.com's Christopher Null {{gave the}} film the same rating as Glanville, writing that [...] "Raimi's biggest grossout is schlock horror <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way" [...] and {{comparing}} it to Romero's Night of the Living Dead {{in its ability to}} create stark atmosphere. Chicago Reader writer Pat Graham commented that the film featured several [...] "clever" [...] turns on the standard horror formula, adding that Raimi's [...] "anything-for-an-effect enthusiasm pays off in lots of formally inventive bits." [...] The make-up effects in one of the final scenes was called [...] "amazing" [...] by Time Out critic Stephen Garrett, who commented that although the film was light on character development, the [...] "relentless" [...] barrage of violent imagery made for an entertaining film. The same site later cited the film as the 41st greatest horror movie ever made. Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian combined The Evil Dead and its sequel Evil Dead II and listed them as the 23rd best horror film ever made, announcing that the former film [...] "stands above its mostly forgotten peers in the 80s horror boom." [...] Complex Magazine composed a list of the twenty-five best horror movies available on Netflix, listing The Evil Dead at No. 21. Don Summer, in his book Horror Movie Freak, and writer Kate Egan have both cited the film as a horror classic.|$|E
500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E

500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I knew we had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing. [...] I knew it was a hit the second I heard it." ...|$|E

The amount was in addition to the $6.5 million already spent by the Navy in efforts to repair the reef. [...] "This settlement agreement recognizes the State of Hawaii's loss of a natural resource and takes into account the U.S. Navy's unprecedented efforts to restore the reef where USS Port Royal ran aground," [...] said Rear Admiral Timothy Giardina, U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy commander.

2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{abuse that}} is suspected, not {{necessarily}} proven, requires reporting to child protection agencies, {{such as the}} Child Protection Services in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as primary care providers and nurses, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child {{that he or she}} has <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. Dolls are sometimes used to help explain what happened. For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins {{went on a}} four-day {{drinking}} binge.

After drinking yet another pint of whiskey, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating [...] "big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me". The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden.

[...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy.
