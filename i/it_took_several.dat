5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E

5|$|Although Cryer gained fame {{with his}} early film roles, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> {{years to find}} success on television; none of his star vehicles, {{including}} The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and The Trouble with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, Cryer was cast as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009 and 2012. Cryer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut down every one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> {{days before they}} were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> {{years and}} a team of assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> {{years for}} Ivy to {{finalize}} the material {{included on the}} album, due {{to the birth of}} lead singer Dominque Durand and musician Andy Chase's daughter, Justine, in 1999. During the album's recording and writing process, Ivy experienced several unexpected events. Following their drop from Epic Records in 1999, the recording suffered further delays after their New York City studio burned down. After being without a record label, they considered signing to Japanese music group EastWest to strengthen their fan base. However, independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album; Ivy signed with both labels and began preparing it for a national release.|$|E

5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British {{survivors}} and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> hours {{to clear the}} bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge to be captured by the 82nd Airborne and Guards' Armoured Division working together. With the resistance at the bridge crushed, the Germans had more troops available to commit to the Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, extending the already existing French Revolutionary Wars. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> months for news of the outbreak of war to reach British India, messages arriving at Calcutta from Consul George Baldwin at Alexandria on 11 June. The Royal Navy commander in the region, Commodore William Cornwallis, immediately set about demanding the surrender of the French trading posts in India. Most fell within a few days, but the major port of Pondicherry refused, and was besieged from 1 August. The siege lasted {{a month before the}} French commander capitulated under bombardment from British land and naval forces. With the French presence eliminated from India, Cornwallis was ordered to return to Europe, leaving minimal naval forces in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth album, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group {{and was replaced by}} Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band.|$|E

5|$|The town's decline {{began in}} the early 15th century, {{following}} the worsening fortunes of the Principality itself. At that time, Achaea, under Prince Centurione II Zaccaria (ruled 1404–30), found itself endangered by the attacks of the Byzantines of the Despotate of the Morea {{on the one hand and}} the expansionist designs of the Tocco family of Cephalonia and Zakynthos on the other. In late 1407, Centurione's own brother-in-law Leonardo II Tocco seized Glarentza and reaped an enormous booty, as recorded in the Chronicle of the Tocco. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> years of conflicts and diplomatic manoeuvrings before a Venetian-mediated deal restored the city to Centurione in July 1414. In 1417, the Byzantines under the Despot Theodore II Palaiologos and his brother John VIII Palaiologos, launched another attack on the remains of the Principality. The brothers made swift progress, forcing Prince Centurione to retire to Glarentza, which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Byzantines. A truce was concluded in 1418, but in the same year, an Italian adventurer, Olivier Franco, seized the town, which in 1421 he sold to Carlo I Tocco, Leonardo's elder brother.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Troops were {{landed on}} the Island of Walcheren at 16:30 on 30 July, while bomb-vessels and gun-boats began a {{bombardment}} of Veere. The town surrendered immediately but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>several</b> days of fighting, before the fort was captured on 1 August. The British then mounted an attack on Flushing, and the island of Zuid-Beveland which was taken unopposed; the forts there having already been deserted. However, the British neglected Cadzand on the south-west side of the Scheldt, where more than 5,700 French troops crossed the river to reinforce Flushing. The capitulation of Fort Rammekens allowed the British to besiege the town on 3 August and to prevent further aid being sent, a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched to the western arm of the Scheldt, to cut it off on the seaward side. The British then began locating and marking a channel for larger ships on 6 August.|$|E
