5|$|Like most {{expansion}} teams, the Raptors {{struggled in}} their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998, the team set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins and their <b>first</b> <b>playoff</b> series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals.

Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, and allowed the results to stand. In the second playoff, Microsoft initially named the runner up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E

He was assigned to officiate his <b>first</b> <b>playoff</b> game in 1986.|$|E
