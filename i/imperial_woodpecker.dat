25|$|Ornithologists have {{traditionally}} recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker. The two look similar despite differences {{in size and}} plumage. Some controversy exists over whether the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker is more appropriately recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed birds along with the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded {{not only that the}} Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene. The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of agrarian reform in the 1930s and 1940s, federal lands and cattle ranches that would become Janos were redistributed to the landless poor.

50|$|Field {{research}} by Tim Gallagher and Martjan Lammertink, reported in Gallagher's 2013 book, found evidence — {{in the form}} of accounts by elderly residents in the bird's range, who saw <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> decades earlier, and who discussed their recollections with the researchers — that foresters working with Mexican logging companies in the 1950s told the local people that the woodpeckers were destroying valuable timber, and encouraged the people to kill the birds. As part of this campaign, the foresters gave the local residents poison to smear on trees that the birds foraged on. Because groups of <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> tended to feed on a single huge, dead, old-growth pine tree for as long as two weeks, applying poison to such a tree would be an effective way to wipe out a group of up to a dozen of these huge woodpeckers — and, perhaps, even to kill off succeeding groups of the birds that might move into the area, and be attracted to the same tree. Gallagher suspects that such a campaign of poisoning may be the key to the species' apparent catastrophic population crash in the 1950s, which has hitherto lacked a satisfactory explanation. A campaign of poisoning could well have killed whole groups of the bird in a short time. The premise of protecting valuable timber from the woodpeckers was, in fact, baseless. <b>Imperial</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> do not forage on, or excavate nest or roosting holes in live, healthy trees.|$|R
50|$|The Magellanic {{woodpecker}} is 36 to 45 cm in length. Males of {{this species}} weigh 312-363 g (11-13 oz), and females weigh 276-312 g (9.7-11 oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 20.5 to 23 cm, the tail is 13.9 to 16.8 cm, the bill is 4.3 to 6 cm and the tarsus is 3.3 to 3.9 cm. They are the largest South American woodpeckers {{and one of the}} largest woodpeckers in the world. Among the species known to be extant, only the non-neotropical members of the Dryocopus genus and the great slaty woodpeckers (Mulleripicus pulverulentus) are larger-bodied.

2500|$|Dr. Michael Collins {{reported}} nine {{sightings of}} Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Pearl River in Louisiana in 2006 and 2008, including an encounter in which kent calls came from two directions {{at the same}} time, and an additional sighting (of two birds) in the Choctawhatchee River in 2007. Three of these sightings are supported by video evidence. Additional analysis of these videos was published in an earlier paper, along with comments by independent experts. Bret Tobalske, an ornithologist who specializes in the flight mechanics of woodpeckers, performed an analysis of wing motion {{and concluded that the}} bird in the 2008 video is a large woodpecker. Only two large woodpeckers occur north of Mexico, but the flap rate is about ten standard deviations greater than the mean flap rate of the pileated woodpecker. The flight speed, narrow wings, and prominent white patches on the dorsal surfaces of the wings are also consistent with ivory-billed but not pileated woodpecker. Avian artist Julie Zickefoose analyzed the 2006 video and commented on the [...] "rared-back pose, long but fluffy and squared-off crest, and extremely long, erect head and neck" [...] and an unusual short flight that {{does not seem to be}} consistent with a pileated woodpecker. A size comparison was carried out using part of the tree in which the bird in the 2006 video was perched. Two forks made it possible to scale frames from the video relative to a photo of a pileated woodpecker specimen that was mounted on the tree. On the basis of the comparison, it is clear that the bird in the video is a large woodpecker, and the size appears to be consistent with an ivory-billed woodpecker. The 2007 video shows events involving a woodpecker delivering a blow that is accompanied by an audible double knock, unusual swooping flights that are consistent with historical accounts of the ivory-billed woodpecker, and a takeoff with deep and rapid flaps that are similar to the flaps of the closely related <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus imperialis) taking off.|$|E

50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> (Campephilus imperialis) is {{a member}} of the woodpecker family, Picidae. The genus Campephilus is essentially a tropical one, embracing 13 species, including the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> If it is not extinct, it is the world's largest woodpecker species, at 56 - 60 cm long. Researchers have discovered that the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has slow climbing strides and a fast wing-flap rate compared with other woodpeckers. Owing to its close taxonomic relationship, and a similarity in appearance, to the ivory-billed woodpecker, it is sometimes called the Mexican ivorybill, but this name is also used for the pale-billed woodpecker. The large and conspicuous bird has long been known to the native inhabitants of Mexico and was called cuauhtotomomi in Nahuatl, uagam by the Tepehuán, and cumecócari by the Tarahumara.|$|E

5000|$|C. p. bairdii, {{originally}} {{designated a}} separate species (Campephilus bairdii) by John Cassin based on suggestions by Spencer Fullerton Baird, was similar in appearance to the American ivory-billed woodpecker, being slightly smaller and having minor variations in plumage {{such as a}} longer white stripe on the head. A more recent study by Fleischer, Kirchman et al. has however suggested that {{not only are the}} Cuban and American forms genetically distinct, but also that they and the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> form a distinct North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the Mid-Pleistocene. The methods adopted by the study suggest that the split between C. principalis and the lineage represented by C. p. bairdii and C. imperialis occurred first, and that all three birds should be regarded as representing distinct species. The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature, while describing the data as [...] "intriguing", has indicated that it is not yet ready to list the American and Cuban forms as two separate species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{imperial}} woodpeckers typical size {{ranges from}} 56 to 60 cm, an enormous, stunning black-and-white woodpecker. The male <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has a red-sided crest, centered black, but otherwise mostly black, with large white wing-patch, thin white [...] "braces" [...] on its mantle {{and a huge}} ivory bill. They are all black except for the inner primaries, which are white-tipped, the white secondaries, and a white scapular stripe which, unlike the ivory-billed woodpecker, does not extend onto the neck. The female is similar, but her crest is all black and (unlike the female ivorybill) recurved at the top, lacking red. Much larger than any other sympatric woodpecker, {{it is the only}} woodpecker in the area with solid black underparts. Its voice is reportedly toy-trumpet-like. The bird was once widespread and, until the early 1950s, not uncommon throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico, from western Sonora and Chihuahua southwards to Jalisco and Michoacán. There is a chance that imperialis followed the mountain region northward into southern Arizona.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{increases}} in human population, there are many threats to the ecosystems of the Sierra Tarahumara Occidental region. The government funding to build a “tourist friendly” atmosphere poses threats {{to the environment and}} indigenous cultures. Roads have been built in the former isolated mountainous zones. Agriculture and grazing as well as the cutting of hardwoods and other trees for firewood has accelerated a soil erosion problem. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and desert ironwood (Olneya tesota) trees are cut and exported primarily to the U.S. for charcoal. Amapa (Tabebuia chrysantha) trees yield highly prized lumber for building and furniture making. Other trees are also cut and sold for their high-priced lumber. Over harvesting of the forests in the area has caused the extinction of the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and Mexican wolf. Approximately, two percent of the original old-growth forest remains. However, a massive forest-harvesting project in the region has been abandoned, for now, by the World Bank. The Mexican forestry department deemed these species of trees “legally protected,” but enforcement is difficult.|$|E
50|$|With the {{probable}} extinctions of the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and the ivory-billed woodpecker, this species, at 48 - 58 cm long and a weight of 360 - 563 g, {{stands as the}} largest woodpecker in the world. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 21.5 to 25 cm, the tail is 13.4 to 16.2 cm, the bill is 6 to 6.5 cm and the tarsus is 3.6 to 4.1 cm. This unique-looking woodpecker has several obvious distinctive features: a very long, strong chisel-tipped bill, an elongated neck and a long tail. A slight crest maybe occasionally evident. This species plumage is almost entirely dark grey or blackish slate-grey overlaid with small white spots. The throat is paler grey and males have small red moustache. Normally, the nominate subspecies is the darkest, most slaty gray race. M. p. harterti has a more pale throat with a greater amount of whitish feather tips forming small spot and is slightly paler below than the nominate, sometimes appearing almiost whitish on the belly. The size and structure readily distinguishes this bird from almost any other species, including other woodpeckers. Occasionally, at first glance, the great slaty woodpecker is mistaken for a hornbill but, obviously, such a resemblance is slight at best.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> prefers open montane forests {{made up of}} Durango, Mexican white, loblolly and Montezuma pines, as well as oak, usually between 2100 and 2700 meters {{above sea}} level. Most records are from {{elevations}} of 1,920-3,050 m, but there are records as low as 1,675 m. It feeds mainly on bark scaled from dead pine trees and feeding on the insect larvae found underneath. There are many reports of more than four individuals, and this grouping behaviour {{may be related to}} its foraging specialisation. Breeding has been recorded between February and June, and probably 1-4 eggs are laid. A mated pair requires a very large area of untouched mature forest to survive, approximately 26 km2; outside the breeding season, the birds are reported to form small groups of up to a dozen individuals and move about a wide area, apparently in response to the availability of food. [...] The main food source, beetle larvae in snags, is probably distributed in patches and peaks within a short period of time. Consequently, feeding-sites are probably best exploited by [...] "nomadic" [...] groups. If operating in groups of seven or eight individuals, the minimum area of old-growth forest for a group is 98 km2.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{is officially}} listed as [...] "critically {{endangered}} (possibly extinct)" [...] by the IUCN and BirdLife International. It was not historically a rare species within a suitable habitat, but {{the total population}} probably never numbered more than 8,000 individuals (Lammertink et al. 1996). Any remaining population {{is assumed to be}} tiny (numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals) based on the lack of confirmed records since 1956; analyses of remaining habitats indicate that no tracts remain which are large enough to support the species.The last confirmed record was from Durango in 1956, and the species is very likely now extinct. If they have gone extinct, it would have been due to habitat deconstruction and fragmentation combined with hunting. These factors are the reason why the species has not been seen in over 50 years, although there have been local reports of sightings. Researchers believe that their decline was also accelerated by active eradication campaigns conducted by logging interests, by over-hunting — for use in folk medicine, and because nestlings were considered a delicacy by the Tarahumara. It has been hunted for sport, food and for medicinal purposes {{over a long period of}} time, and feathers and bills were reportedly used in rituals by Tepheuana and Huichol tribes in the south of Durango. Additionally, imperial woodpeckers are stunning birds, and as the species became increasingly rare, many were apparently shot by people who had never encountered such a bird, and wanted to get a closer look. [...] The habitat in which the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> was located was predominantly in coniferous forests (terrain levels at 2,700-2,900 m. elevation). The area in which they lived was abundant with large dead trees which could be linked to their extinction. The area had been cleared and logged multiple times by 2010. Increasing effort in conservation biology is being devoted to the analysis of the extinction risk as well as the search for the rare, long unseen, species. There are a handful of more recent, unconfirmed sightings, the most recent of which closely followed the 2005 publication of the purported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker. Lammertink et al. (1996), after extensively reviewing post-1956 reports, conclude that the species did indeed survive into the 1990s in the central part of its range, but also consider a continued survival very unlikely. According to them, the population was always restricted in historic times, although the species was indeed present in maximum density before a catastrophic decline during the 1950s. The lack of good records from that time is apparently based more on lack of research than on actual rarity, but this seems to have changed radically only one decade later.|$|E
50|$|Adults are 40 to 49 cm long, span 66 to 75 cm {{across the}} wings, and weigh 250 to 400 g, {{with an average}} weight of 300 g. Each wing {{measures}} 21.4 to 25.3 cm, the tail measures 14.0 to 17.4 cm, the bill is 4.1 to 6.0 cm and the tarsus measures 3.1 to 3.8 cm. They are mainly black with a red crest, and have a white line {{down the sides of}} the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct, but has an undulating quality, similar to the relatively unique flight-style of all woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black. Two species found in the Old World, the white-bellied and black woodpeckers, are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the Southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> of Mexico. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not extinct. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.|$|E

50|$|The ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} {{ranks among}} the largest woodpeckers {{in the world and}} is the largest in the United States. The closely related and likewise possibly extinct <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (C. imperialis) of western Mexico is, or was, the largest woodpecker. The ivory-billed has a total length of 48 to 53 cm, and based on very scant information, weighs about 450 to 570 g. It has a typical 76 cm wingspan. Standard measurements attained included a wing chord length of 23.5 - 26.5 cm, a tail length of 14 - 17 cm, a bill length of 5.8 - 7.3 cm, and a tarsus length of 4 - 4.6 cm.The bird is shiny blue-black with white markings on its neck and back and extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel.|$|E
40|$|The pine-oak {{forests of}} the Sierra Madre Occidental, a {{mountain}} range in NW Mexico, have recently been recognized as an area of high endemism and biodiversity. Selective logging threatens three bird species endemic to this habitat, who depend on standing dead trees (snags). This report {{is based on an}} 11 month field survey that aimed to locate oldgrowth remnants and to assess the status of the endemic birds. Old-growth is defined here as a forest that has never been logged mechanically. Old-growth forests were located by ground-truthing of areas predicted by various methods: analyses of topographical maps and satellite images, aerial surveys, interviews with forestry technicians and local inhabitants, and literature studies. None of the prediction methods gives unambiguous results on their own. Only by applying the whole set of techniques could a comprehensive inventory be obtained of old-growth sites. Of the original 93, 560 km² of pine-oak habitat in the Sierra Madre Occidental, 571 km² remained as old-growth in 1995. This is a reduction of 99. 4 %. The forests on high mesas, where the largest and most accessible timber stood, have been reduced to 22 km² uncut forest. In logged forests pines greater than 30 cm girth have been extracted and snags have been cut for the production of paper pulp. Small settlements are everywhere. Information on the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> Campephilus imperialis was obtained through interviews with 62 elder inhabitants who had known the bird. The extinction peak of this species was between 1946 and 1965, when 60 % of the informants saw their last <b>Imperial</b> <b>Woodpecker.</b> Hunting by settlers and loggers, for fun and for medicinal purposes, quickly decimated populations. Recovery from the shooting became impossible through the ensuing logging of nearly all the pine-oak habitat. Mature pines and pine snags were removed, depriving the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> of foraging and nesting sites. Imperial Woodpeckers were often seen in groups. A typical group consisted of seven or eight birds. With an estimated average density of one <b>Imperial</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> per 13 km², the original pine-oak habitat in the whole range of the species may have carried only 8, 000 individuals or 1060 groups. Interviews, and workings found in one old-growth area, indicate that very few Imperial Woodpeckers may have survived into the 1990 s. Extinction of the species seems nevertheless inevitable since nowhere does any breeding habitat remain. Cutting of snags is the main threat to the Thick-billed Parrot Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha. This species only breeds at altitudes above 2300 m, but snags are scarce on the exploited mesa forests in the highest parts of the sierra. The breeding range runs from within 85 km of the US border in northern Chihuahua south to central western Durango, with an apparent gap in southern Chihuahua. Pine seeds for foraging are widely available in young recovering forest. Compared with historical records, encountered groups of wintering Thick-billed Parrots were small, few groups were seen, and the numbers of bathing and drinking parrots at a waterfall in northern Chihuahua were low. This indicates numbers have sharply declined {{in the course of the}} 20 th century. The status of the Eared Trogon Euptilotis neoxenus is far less critical. Eared Trogons were observed at 55 locations, mainly in canyons. Nests were found in riparian corridors in canyons. Such corridors are hardly accessible to the logging industry. The ability, and probable preference, of the Eared Trogon to breed in canyons likely explains why it is still fairly common. The erroneous notion that the Eared Trogon is a local and rare species must stem from the paucity of field studies in the Sierra Madre Occidental, as well as the wariness of the bird. It is mostly to be detected by its vocalizations. Efforts are being made to ensure the total protection of three priority areas (figures 26 to 28). These areas encompass the main old-growth fragments in the Sierra Madre Occidental. They are also of major importance to the endemic fauna. Protection of snags is required for three breeding areas of the Thick-billed Parrot (figures 29 to 31). Ideally, exploitation of snags should be banned throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental...|$|E
40|$|We used ancient DNA {{analysis}} of seven museum specimens {{of the endangered}} North American ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and three specimens of the species from Cuba to document their degree of differentiation and their relationships to other Campephilus woodpeckers. Analysis of these mtDNA sequences reveals that the Cuban and North American ivory bills, along with the <b>imperial</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus imperialis) of Mexico, are a monophyletic group and are roughly equidistant genetically, suggesting each lineage may be a separate species. Application of {{both internal and external}} rate calibrations indicates that the three lineages split more than one million years ago, in the Mid-Pleistocene. We thus can exclude the hypothesis that Native Americans introduced North American ivory-billed woodpeckers to Cuba. Our sequences of all three woodpeckers also provide an important DNA barcoding resource for identification of non-invasive samples or remains of these critically endangered and charismatic woodpeckers...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{history museum}} {{collections}} represent a vast source of ancient and historical DNA samples from extinct taxa {{that can be}} utilized by high-throughput sequencing tools to reveal novel genetic and phylogenetic information about them. Here, {{we report on the}} successful sequencing of complete mitochondrial genome sequences (mitogenomes) from eleven extinct bird species, using de novo assembly of short sequences derived from toepad samples of degraded DNA from museum specimens. For two species (the Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratorius and the South Island Piopio Turnagra capensis), whole mitogenomes were already available from recent studies, whereas for five others (the Great Auk Pinguinis impennis, the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> Campehilus imperialis, the Huia Heteralocha acutirostris, the Kauai Oo Moho braccathus and the South Island Kokako Callaeas cinereus), there were partial mitochondrial sequences available for comparison. For all seven species, we found sequence similarities of > 98 %. For the remaining four species (the Kamao Myadestes myadestinus, the Paradise Parrot Psephotellus pulcherrimus, the Ou Psittirostra psittacea and the Lesser Akialoa Akialoa obscura), there was no sequence information available for comparison, so we conducted blast searches and phylogenetic analyses to determine their phylogenetic positions and identify their closest extant relatives. These mitogenomes will be valuable for future analyses of avian phylogenetics and illustrate the importance of museum collections as repositories for genomics resources. The final version of this research has been published in Molecular Ecology Resources. © 2017 Wile...|$|E
