A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglia,</b> thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents.

5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglia.</b> Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity.

Physiological {{data suggest that the}} intrinsic primary afferent neurons within the intestine are also nociceptors. In this study, we have compared IB 4 binding to each of these neuron types in the guinea-pig. The only neurons in the intestine to be readily revealed by IB 4 binding have Dogiel-type-II morphology; these neurons have been previously identified as intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Most of the neurons that are IB 4 -positive in the myenteric plexus are calbindin-immunoreactive, whereas those in the submucosal ganglia are immunoreactive for NeuN. The neurons that bind IB 4 strongly have a similar appearance in enteric, <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> and trigeminal <b>ganglia.</b> Binding is to the cell surface, to the first part of axons and to cytoplasmic organelles. A low level of binding was found in the extracellular matrix. A few other neurons in all ganglia exhibit faint staining with IB 4. Strongly reactive neurons are absent from the gastric corpus.

40|$|Nerve {{regeneration}} in {{an injured}} spinal cord is often restricted, {{contributing to the}} devastating outcome of neurologic impairment below the site of injury. Although implantation of tissue-engineered scaffolds has evolved as a potential treatment method, the outcomes remain sub-optimal. One possible reason may be the lack of topographical signals from these constructs to provide contact guidance to invading cells or regrowing axons. Nanofibers mimic the natural extracellular matrix architecturally and may therefore promote physiologically relevant cellular phenotypes. In this study, the potential application of electrospun collagen nanofibers (dia-meter = 208. 2 – 90. 4 nm) for spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Primary rat astrocytes and <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglias</b> (DRGs) were seeded on collagen-coated glass cover slips (two-dimensional [2 D] substrate controls), and randomly oriented or aligned collagen fibers to evaluate scaffold topographical effects on astrocyte behavior and neurite outgrowth, respectively. When cultured on collagen nanofibers, as-trocyte proliferation and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were suppressed as compared to cells on 2 D controls at days 3 (p 4, p < 0. 01) and directed the orientation of neurite outgrowth from DRGs along fiber axes. In the contrast, neurites emanated radially on randomly oriented collagen fibers.

Here the author reports the distribution of caldesmon in the CNS and ganglia of the mouse using the same antibodies. Western blot analysis of mouse brain and spinal cord showed the preponderance of l-caldesmon and suggested at least two l-caldesmon isoforms in the brain. Immunostaining revealed the predominant reactivity of smooth muscle cells and cells resembling pericytes of many large and small blood vessels, ependymocytes, and secretory cells of the pineal gland and pituitary gland. Neuronal perikarya and neuropil in general displayed no or weak immunoreactivity, but there was stronger labeling of neuronal perikarya in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> and trigeminal <b>ganglia.</b> In the brain, staining of the neuropil was stronger in the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum. Results show that caldesmon is expressed in many different cell types in the CNS and ganglia, consistent with the notion that l-caldesmon is ubiquitously expressed, but it appears most concentrated in smooth muscle cells, pericytes, epithelial cells, secretory cells, and neuronal perikarya in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> and trigeminal <b>ganglia...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{pathogenic}} role {{of brain}} derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the incisional pain is poorly understood. The present study explores {{the role of}} the BDNF in the incision-induced pain hypersensitivity. Methods A longitudinal incision was made in one plantar hind paw of isoflurane-anesthetized rats. <b>Dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglias</b> (DRG) and spinal cords were removed at various postoperative times (1 – 72 h). Expression pattern of BDNF was determined by immunohistochemistry and double-labeling immunofluorescence. Lidocaine-induced blockade of sciatic nerve function was used to determine the importance of afferent nerve activity on BDNF expression in the DRG and spinal cord after incision. BDNF antibody was administered intrathecally (IT) or intraperitoneal (IP) to modulate the spinal BDNF or peripheral BDNF after incision. Results After hind-paw incision, the BDNF was upregulated in the ipsilateral lumbar DRG and spinal cord whereas thoracic BDNF remained unchanged in response to incision. The upregulated BDNF was mainly expressed in the large-sized neurons in DRG and the neurons and the primary nerve terminals in the spinal cord. Sciatic nerve blockade prevented the increase of BDNF in the DRG and spinal cord. IT injection of BDNF antibody greatly inhibited the mechanical allodynia induced by incision whereas IP administration had only marginal effect. Conclusion The present study showed that incision induced the segmental upregulation of BDNF in the DRG and spinal cord through somatic afferent nerve transmission, and the upregulated BDNF contributed to the pain hypersensitivity induced by surgical incision. </p...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{transcription}} factor 3 (ATF 3) is induced in various tissues {{in response to}} stress. In this experiment, ATF 3 expression was studied in adult rats subjected either to a <b>dorsal</b> or ventral <b>root</b> avulsion (L 4 - 6), or sciatic nerve transection. Postoperative survival times varied between 1, 5 hours to 3 weeks. In additional experiments an avulsed ventral root was directly replanted to the spinal cord. <b>Dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglias</b> (DRGs) from humans exposed to traumatic <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> avulsions were also examined. After sciatic nerve transection ATF 3 immunoreactivity (ATF 3 IR) was detected in a few DRG neurons already 6 hours (h) after the lesion. After 24 h the number had clearly increased and still at 3 weeks DRG neurons remained labeled. In the ventral horn, ATF 3 IR in motoneurons was first detected 24 h after the sciatic nerve transection, and still 3 weeks postoperatively lesioned motoneurons showed ATF 3 labeling. After a ventral root avulsion many spinal motoneurons showed ATF 3 IR already after 3 h, and after 6 h all motoneurons were labeled. At 3 weeks {{a majority of the}} lesioned motoneurons had died, but all the remaining ones were labeled. When an avulsed ventral root was directly replanted, motoneurons survived and were still labeled at 5 weeks. In DRG, a few neurons were labeled already at 1, 5 h after a <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> avulsion. At 24 h the number had increased but still only a minority of the neurons were labeled. At 3 days the number of labeled neurons was reduced, and a further reduction was at hand at 7 days and 3 weeks. In parallel, in humans, 3 days after a traumatic <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> avulsion, only a few DRG neurons showed ATF 3 IR. At 6 weeks no labeled neurons could be detected. These facts imply that ATF 3 response to axotomy involves a distance dependent mechanism. ATF 3 also appears to be a useful and reliable neuronal marker of nerve lesions even in humans. In addition, ATF 3 up-regulation in both motor and sensory neurons seems to be linked to regenerative competence...|$|R

25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglia</b> neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The human NECDIN gene is {{involved}} in a neurodevelopmental disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Previously we reported a mouse Necdin knock-out model with similar defects to PWS patients. Despite the putative roles attributed to Necdin, mainly from in vitro studies, its in vivo function remains unclear. In this study, we investigate sensory-motor behaviour in Necdin deficient mice. We reveal cellular defects and analyse their cause. Results We report sensory differences in Necdin deficient mice compared to wild type animals. These differences led us to investigate sensory neuron development in Necdin deficient mouse embryos. First, we describe the expression pattern of Necdin in developing DRGs and report a reduction of one-third in specified sensory neurons in <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> <b>ganglia</b> and show that this neuronal loss is achieved by E 13. 5, when DRGs sensory neurons are specified. In parallel, we observed an increase of 41 % in neuronal apoptosis during the wave of naturally occurring cell death at E 12. 5. Since it is assumed that Necdin is a P 75 NTR interactor, we looked at the P 75 NTR-expressing cell population in Necdin knock-out embryos. Unexpectedly, Necdin loss of function has no effect on p 75 NTR expressing neurons suggesting no direct genetic interaction between Necdin and P 75 NTR in this context. Although we exclude a role of Necdin in axonal outgrowth from spinal sensory neurons in early developmental stages; such a role could occur later in neuronal differentiation. Finally we also exclude an anti-proliferative role of Necdin in developing sensory neurons. Conclusion Overall, our data show clearly that, in early development of the nervous system, Necdin is an anti-apoptotic or survival factor. </p...|$|R
40|$|Estradiol has {{profound}} {{actions on}} the structure and function of the nervous system. In addition to nuclear actions that directly modulate gene expression, the idea that estradiol can rapidly activate cell signaling by binding to membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) has emerged. Even the regulation of sexual receptivity, an action previously thought to be completely regulated by nuclear ERs, {{has been shown to}} have a membrane-initiated estradiol signaling (MIES) component. This highlighted the question of the nature of mERs. Several candidates have been proposed, ERα, ERβ, ER-X, GPR 30 (G protein coupled estrogen receptor), and a receptor activated by a diphenylacrylamide compound, STX. Although each of these receptors {{has been shown to be}} active in specific assays, we present evidence for and against their participation in sexual receptivity by acting in the lordosis-regulating circuit. The initial MIES that activates the circuit is in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH). Using both activation of μ-opioid receptors (MOR) in the medial preoptic nucleus and lordosis behavior, we document that both ERα and the STX-receptor participate in the required MIES. ERα and the STX-receptor activation of cell signaling are dependent on the transactivation of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR 1 a) that augment progesterone synthesis in astrocytes and protein kinase C (PKC) in ARH neurons. While estradiol-induced sexual receptivity does not depend on neuroprogesterone, proceptive behaviors do. Moreover, the ERα and the STX-receptor activation of medial preoptic MORs and augmentation of lordosis were sensitive to mGluR 1 a blockade. These observations suggest a common mechanism through which mERs are coupled to intracellular signaling cascades, not just in regulating reproduction, but in actions throughout the neuraxis including the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglias...</b>|$|R

500|$|Pain is {{generally}} an unpleasant feeling {{in response to}} an event that either damages or can potentially damage the body's tissues. There are four main steps in the process of feeling pain: [...] transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation. The nerve cells that detect pain have cell bodies located in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglia</b> and fibers that transmit these signals to the spinal cord. The process of pain sensation starts when the pain-causing event triggers the endings of appropriate sensory nerve cells. This type of cell converts the event into an electrical signal by transduction. Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the transducing cell to the posterior horn of spinal cord, from there to the brain stem, and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the thalamus and the limbic system. In the brain, the pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain perception. Through modulation, the brain can modify the sending of further nerve impulses by decreasing or increasing the release of neurotransmitters.|$|E

Interestingly, absence of Delta- 1 leads to diminution of both neurons and glia in peripheral ganglia, suggesting a general depletion of the ganglion precursor pool in mutant mice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{performed}} {{in situ hybridization}} to determine the cell type specific accumulation of the intron of the latency-associated transcript (LAT) in tissues in HSV- 2 LAT transgenic mice in which LAT expression is driven by its native promoter. We identified LAT in multiple cell types in most tissues analyzed from HSV- 2 LAT transgenic mice. While weak to moderate signals were seen in brain and spinal cord neurons, epithelial cells, and muscle cells, the strongest signals were detected in neurons from <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> and trigeminal <b>ganglia.</b> About 70 – 86 % of neurons in these ganglia were LAT-positive with varying signal intensities, while cells surrounding the neurons were LAT-negative. The frequency of A 5 or KH 10 -positive neurons was similar in LAT-positive and total neurons. These data indicate that HSV- 2 LAT promoter activity is not restricted to neurons and that LAT accumulation in ganglionic neurons is likely regulated by cell-specific factors...|$|R
