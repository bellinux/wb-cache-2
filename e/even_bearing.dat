50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{through the early}} 20th, blow-by gases from {{internal}} combustion were allowed {{to find their own}} way out to the atmosphere past seals and gaskets. It was considered normal for oil to be found both inside and outside an engine, and for oil to drip to the ground in small but constant amounts. The latter had also been true for steam engines and steam locomotives in the decades before. <b>Even</b> <b>bearing</b> and valve designs generally made little to no provision for keeping oil or waste gases contained. Sealed bearings and valve covers were for special applications only. Gaskets and shaft seals were meant to limit loss of oil, but they were usually not expected to entirely prevent it. On internal combustion engines, the hydrocarbon-rich blow-by gases would diffuse through the oil in the seals and gaskets into the atmosphere. Engines with high amounts of blow-by (e.g., worn out ones, or ones not well built to begin with) would leak profusely via those routes.|$|E

5000|$|To the Royal Numismatic SocietyPublished 1841On {{the evening}} of 15 May 1840 workmen, engaged in {{repairing}} the southern embankment of the river Ribble, near Curedale Hall, and about three miles from Preston, were agreeably surprised by the discovery of hidden treasure, which had for many centuries laid inhumed in that delightful and secluded vale within three feet of {{the surface of the}} pasture, and about thirty yards {{from the edge of the}} river. A portion of the earth, under the spot where the treasure lay, having been previously removed, the leaden case, which was in a corroded state, was crushed to pieces by the fall, aided by the weight of the superincumbent soil, and disclosed its extensive and varied treasures before the astonished gaze of the workmen, who immediately set up a simultaneous shout. The attracted the attention of the hind of Curedale Hall, who, hastening to the place, found the workmen collected around the treasure in the act of the general scramble, each endeavouring to obtain the greatest share of the booty. The hind, however, lost little time in informing them that they must return the property, adding that the pieces of metal were probably of pewter or solder and consequently of little value, and that the coins appeared to be nothing more than tin counters. Upon this, the greater part was unpocketed, and being collected together, the treasure was conveyed to the hall, deposited in a tub of water and well washed with a birch-besom, and on the following day deposited in the old bank of Preston. William Asheton Esq., now in Florence, is the owner of the property where the discovery was made. The ingots of silver, annulets, neck chains and rings and other ornaments, are stated to weigh about sixty three pounds, whilst the coins, including the wooden box in which they are enclosed and a portion of the fragments of the leaden case, the hind tells me weights twelve pounds, being about half the weight given in the papers. A portion of the coins and other antiques still remain in the hall for the inspection of visitors, whilst some of the relics of by gone days are stated to have found their way into the hands of private individuals; and this is not improbable, as several pieces, it is said, have by diligent scratching, been gleaned from the soil since the bulk was removed to the bank.If it may be allowed to judge of the whole from those exhibited in the hall, and from casts taken from some of the coins in possession of Mr Asshetons agent, I should say, that not more than a third part are Anglo Saxon, the remainder being foreign, chiefly French, with probably a mixture of prelatical coins from other parts of the Continent, and a few <b>even</b> <b>bearing</b> characters similar to those of the Cufic Coins, described in a late number of your interesting chronicle.The Anglo-Saxon coins are chiefly of St. Eadmund, Alfred, Edward the Elder, and Athelstan; and as the last named monarch died in the 941, the coins have probably been buried for a period of about nine centuries. I have also seen a penny of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, of a type similar to Plate X11.fig.4., Ruding; this last however is stated to have been found near Ribchester. Scarcely any two of the Ecclesiastical pennies of St Eadmund have the same reverse, and most of them are probably unpublished, as well as St Eadmunds halfpenny, of which I have only seen one specimen. With regards to the coins of Alfred several types occur, and one in particular, that appears unpublished; its beautiful reverse is not, I believe, found on any Anglo Saxon coin figured by Ruding; it is in the possession of the hind at Curedale Hall. Several moneyers’ names are found, not to be met with in Rudings list. The rarest however, of Alfreds coins is his halfpenny, not hitherto, known to exist ( [...] a specimen was obtained by a collector in London sometime before the discovery of this hoard) of which a cast has been shown me, bearing the moneyers name, Aberht; and another specimen, bearing on its reverse the London monogram. With respect to the pennies of Alfred, it may be observed, that the greater number appear to be of the type without the portrait and place of mintage. Of the Oxford type, comparatively few specimens occur, and much fewer still of those bearing the portrait. Of the pennies of Edward the elder, bearing the portrait I have only seen two; they are in fine preservation, but differ materially in the form of the head from those appropriated to this monarch by Ruding. Of Athelstan’s pennies I have not seen or heard of one bearing the bust.The French coins are of Charles le Chauve, Louis le Begue, &c, and several occur bearing the names of towns, among which may be mentioned, Bourges, Evreux, Limoges, Orleans, Quentin, Toulouse, and Tours; and of some of these in denominations smaller than the usual size. One, of Toulouse, bears on the obverse, ‘Oddo Rex’ [...] There are also several coins which I am unable satisfactorily to appropriate, bearing on one side, ‘Cunnetti’, and others of a nearly similar type and fabric, with ‘Siefredus Rex’, ‘Mirabilia fecit, ‘ and c.The ownership of the property is undecided, and will probably become a question between the Crown and Mr. Assheton, as agents for both parties have already put in their respective claims.|$|E

The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire.

40|$|Trade wind regions cover {{most of the}} {{tropical}} oceans, and the prevailing cloud type is shallow cumulus. These small clouds are parameterized by climate models, and changes in their radiative effects strongly and directly contribute to the spread in estimates of climate sensitivity. This study investigates the structure and variability of these clouds in observations and climate models. The study builds upon recent detailed model evaluations using observations from the island of Barbados. Using a dynamical regimes framework, satellite and reanalysis products are {{used to compare the}} Barbados region and the broader tropics. It is shown that clouds in the Barbados region are similar to those across the trade wind regions, implying that observational findings from the Barbados Cloud Observatory are relevant to clouds across the tropics. The same methods are applied to climate models to evaluate the simulated clouds. The models generally capture the cloud radiative effect, but underestimate cloud cover and show an array of cloud vertical structures. Some models show strong biases in the environment of the Barbados region in summer, weakening the connection between the regional biases and those across the tropics. <b>Even</b> <b>bearing</b> that limitation in mind, it is shown that covariations of cloud and environmental properties in the models are inconsistent with observations.

40|$|Glucose 6 -phosphate {{transport}} {{has been}} well characterized in liver microsomes. The transport {{is required for the}} functioning of the glucose- 6 -phosphatase enzyme that is situated in the lumen of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. The genetic deficiency of the glucose 6 -phosphate transport activity causes a severe metabolic disease termed type 1 b glycogen storage disease. The cDNA encoding a liver transporter for glucose 6 -phosphate was cloned and was found to be mutated in patients suffering from glycogen storage disease 1 b. While related mRNAs have been described in liver and other tissues, the encoded protein(s) has not been immunologically characterized yet. In the present study, we report (using antibodies against three different peptides of the predicted amino acid sequence) that a major protein encoded by the glucose 6 -phosphate transporter gene is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes of rat and human liver. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of approx. 33 kDa using SDS/PAGE, but several lines of evidence indicate that its real molecular mass is 46 kDa, as expected. The glucose 6 -phosphate transporter protein was also immunodetected in kidney microsomes, but not in microsomes derived from human fibrocytes, rat spleen and lung, and a variety of cell lines. Moreover, little or no expression of the glucose 6 -phosphate transporter protein was found in liver microsomes obtained from three glycogen storage disease 1 b patients, <b>even</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations that do not directly interfere with protein translation, which can be explained by a (proteasome-mediated) degradation of the mutated transporter...|$|E
