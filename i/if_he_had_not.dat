5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
60|$|MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, I know--but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>n't</b> {{acted like}} this {{nobody would have}} suffered.|$|R
60|$|Luc. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not,</b> I am {{resolved}} we'll {{make ourselves}} as remarkable as we can: I'll exercise my talent of dancing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rely on it, sir,' said Mr. Crosbie, 'that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{returned}} to his friends in Scotland, <b>he</b> must <b>have</b> gone to his friends in England.' ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E
5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} he at least knew of his VC prior to his death, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
50|$|The {{whole game}} takes place over 25 minutes in real time. Dan fails the mission <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{destroyed}} the Mekon and escaped within this time.|$|R

5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} the day after. His replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister) {{he was not a}} particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
5|$|Peterle conceded immediately. In {{his first}} statements, Peterle said his defeat was a {{vote against the}} ruling Janša government, {{and that he had}} {{expected}} a better result. He added, however, that he would have regretted it <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> decided to run for the office. By midnight, unofficial results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68% vs. 32%. Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} on June 22–23, 2012, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the first round, the Canucks drafted Brendan Gaunce, a two-way centre with size. Leading up to the draft, Gaunce was ranked 13th among North American skaters by the NHL's {{scouting}} department, and was the top-ranked Canadian forward. Projected to be a mid-first round pick, he dipped slightly to 26 where he was selected by the Canucks. General Manager Mike Gillis stated that going into the draft, they had targeted Gaunce, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been available, Vancouver would have traded down to add extra picks.|$|E
6000|$|... "The plot thickens, eh?" [...] he said. [...] "What is Mr. Scobell {{doing in}} New York, I wonder, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> come {{to keep an}} eye on his interests?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Rodgers, {{quarterback for}} the Green Bay Packers in the NFL, {{is well known for}} photobombing the captain's picture before every game (<b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been elected a captain himself).|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure," [...] said Janet, {{superior}} {{by three}} years of wisdom, [...] "that abeyance only happens about Scotch peerages; and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> made a will, mother will be heiress." ...|$|R
5|$|To {{begin the}} 1913season, Lavender was the team's opening day {{starting}} pitcher in a 5–3 loss to St. Louis on April 12. After his successful rookie season, he was largely ineffective {{in the first}} half of 1913season; so much so that manager Johnny Evers was contemplating putting Lavender on waivers <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> regained his form from the previous season. Lavender showed signs of improvement, surrendering just three hits in a 12–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on June30, followed by a 5–1win over the Reds on July3. This rebound was short-lived, however; Chicago lost his next four starts before a 6–5win over the Boston Braves on July27. He pitched in 40 games, half of which were in relief, and had a 10–14 win–loss record. His ERA increased to 3.66, and he led the NL in hit batsmen with 13.|$|E
5|$|Định {{was born}} in the Bình Sơn District in the Quảng Ngãi {{prefecture}} in Quảng Nam Province in central Vietnam. The son of a military mandarin named Trương Cầm, Định went south in the 1830s when his father was posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định enjoyed a reputation among the locals for his martial skills and knowledge of the military classics. He married the daughter of a wealthy resident of Tân An in nearby Dinh Tuong Province, having moved there after his father's unexpected death. It was likely that he would have returned to central Vietnam <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> married.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to be the number one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I {{not take}} mine ease in mine inn?" [...] the {{traveller}} asks rather anxiously than defiantly {{when he finds}} himself a stranger in a strange place, and he is apt to add, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> written or wired ahead to some specific hotel, [...] "Which of mine inns shall I take mine ease in?" [...] He is the more puzzled to choose the more inns there are to choose from, and his difficulty is enhanced <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> considered {{that some of his}} inns may be full or may be too dear, and yet others undesirable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{something}} was said about it, {{but not in}} a way the fellow could understand," [...] answered Guert, carelessly. [...] "Let him come on, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> enough of us yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now I {{have told}} you,' said the boy, 'will {{you let me}} go back to my old man? <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he will die.' ...|$|R
5|$|The Nixon family {{traveled}} to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences {{and met with}} leaders of the countries he visited. The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not {{to run for president}} in 1964; even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> he believed {{it would be difficult to}} defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson. In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E

6000|$|... "No--yes;--it is {{a species}} of pride, but not that pride of which you spoke. A man cannot be honest <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> some pride. You yourself; would you not rather starve than become a beggar?" ...|$|R

25|$|On 31 January 2014, Ledley joined Crystal Palace for an {{undisclosed}} fee on a three-and-a-half year contract. His transfer move was completed with only minutes to spare before {{the conclusion of the}} transfer window. Ledley revealed that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> joined Crystal Palace, he would have signed a new contract with Celtic. Upon joining Crystal Palace, Ledley was given the number 28 shirt.|$|E
