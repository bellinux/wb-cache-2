This method yields good degenerately doped junctions. However {{it is not}} clear whether the process can be used with 300 mm wafer technology due to the demand for a high thermal budget. Proximity Rapid Thermal Diffusion (PRTD) uses the RTP tool for its thermal processing. The amount of time used for the processing is in seconds which yields to a low thermal budget. Moreover RTP tools are a common place in the industry and hence comparatively, PRTD is easy to integrate into the wafer fabrication process. Tunneling diodes are fabricated using the proximity diffusion technique where a dopant is diffused from a source wafer to a device wafer in a RTP chamber. The resulting devices yielded PVCR of 2. 1 and a current density of 160 mA/cm 2 at 300 K. The performance of this device is better than the device which was fabricated before at 850 °C.

With the correct lasing and implant conditions, the process can be used to form ultrashallow, heavily <b>doped</b> <b>junctions</b> in boron-implanted silicon. Laser energy in the nonmelt regime has been supplied to the silicon surface at a ramp rate greater than 10 C/s. This rapid ramp rate will help decrease dopant diffusion while supplying enough energy to the surface to produce dopant activation. High-dose, nonamor-phizing boron implants at a dose of 10 ions/cm and energies of 5 KeV and 1 KeV are annealed with a 308 -nm excimer laser. Sub-sequent rapid thermal anneals are used to study the effect of laser annealing as a pretreatment.

40|$|Laser thermal {{processing}} (LTP) of ion implanted silicon involves melting and recrystallizing an implantation induced amorphous layer containing dopants as {{a method}} of producing ultra shallow highly <b>doped</b> <b>junctions</b> in silicon. After LTP there can exist a high concentration of extended defects in the recrystallized region. These defects are commonly in the form of stacking faults and microtwins that propagate from throughout the region that had been amorphous prior to laser melting. In order to determine the origin of these extended defects, the effect of the dose rate of the silicon preamorphization implant was studied. A 10 keV 1 1015 cm 2 Si+ implant was done into silicon at dose rates between 0. 06 and 0. 48 mA/cm 2. High-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (HR-XTEM) results show the roughness of the amorphous crystalline interface increases with increasing dose rate up to 0. 24 mA/cm 2 then decreases because of dynamic annealing.

In this Letter, we present a multimode field effect transistors device using silicon nanowires that feature an axial n-type/intrinsic <b>doping</b> <b>junction.</b> A heterostructural device design is achieved by employing a self-aligned nickel-silicide source contact. The polymorph operation of the dual-gate device enabling the configuration of one p- and two n-type transistor modes is demonstrated.

With a combined band-to-band and Schottky tunneling mechanism, in p-type mode a subthreshold swing as low as 143 mV/dec and an ON/OFF ratio of up to 104 is found. As the device operates in forward bias, a nonconventional tunneling transistor is realized, enabling an effective suppression of ambipolarity. Depending on the drain bias, two different n-type modes are distinguishable. The carrier injection is dominated by thermionic emission in forward bias with a maximum ON/OFF ratio of up to 107 whereas in reverse bias a Schottky tunneling mechanism dominates the carrier transport...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{nanoscale}} unipolar rectifying diode, {{so called}} self-switching diode (SSD), based on electrostatic effects, {{was presented in}} [1]. This device provides a rectifying behavior {{without the use of}} any <b>doping</b> <b>junction</b> or barrier structure (like in p-n or Schottky barrier diodes) and can be fabricated with a simple single-step lithographic process. The downscaling of the SSDs is therefore so simple that, together with the intrinsically high electron velocity of InGaAs channels, the fabrication of devices working in the THz range can be envisaged. Indeed, the high frequency performance of SSDs can be dramatically improved thanks to a much shorter transit time, due not only to a smaller channel length but also to an enhanced electron velocity associated to ballistic transport. In this work we will make use of a semiclassical 2 D Monte Carlo (MC) simulator (employed previously to succesfully model nanoscaled ballistic devices: TBJs, YBJs and ballistic rectifiers [2 - 4]) to optimize the high frequency performance of SSDs. A SEM picture of a fabricated SSD is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The geometry of the corresponding simulation domain is sketched in Fig. 1 (b).
