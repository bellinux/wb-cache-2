40|$|Software {{architecture}} {{allows us}} to make many decisions about a software system and analyze it even before it has been implemented, {{so as to make}} planned development possible. Similarly, architecture-based software <b>evolution</b> <b>planning</b> makes <b>planned</b> <b>evolution</b> possible by allowing us to make many decisions about the evolution of a software system and to analyze its evolution at the level of architecture design before software evolution is realized. In this paper, we develop a framework for architecture-based software <b>evolution</b> <b>planning.</b> It is done by defining various foundational terms and concepts, providing a taxonomy of software <b>evolution</b> <b>plans,</b> and then showing how to calculate values for various types of plans. By identifying and defining constituent foundational concepts, this conceptual framework makes precise the notion of ‘architecture-based software planning’.

50|$|At {{about the}} same time as FKA and ESA {{announced}} their plans for the CSTS spacecraft, the German space agency DLR together with EADS Astrium announced their support for the ATV evolution proposal. This proposal envisions the development of a modified ATV with a reentry capsule that would be used to return cargo from the ISS by 2013 and in a second phase a manned vehicle based on this modified ATV by 2017. Those dates were later revised to 2015 and 2020 respectively. This proposal was presented to ESA's governing body at its meeting in November 2008 and received funding for an initial development phase of a cargo return vehicle that may be ready by 2017. The ATV Evolution concept may have contributed to the end of the CSTS project.

According to the FAA Runway Safety Report (2004), vehicle deviations accounted for 20 % (291 events) of all runway incursions {{during the period of}} 2000 through 2003. The focus of this quantitative correlational study is whether demographic characteristics are a significant factor in the airport movement area driver training that employees receive at Operational <b>Evolution</b> <b>Plan</b> (OEP- 35) US towered airports. Airport driver training officials at the OEP- 35 airports were surveyed using a five-point Likert-type survey. The data from this study suggested that demographic characteristics are significant factors in the airport driver training that employees receive at Operational <b>Evolution</b> <b>Plan</b> (OEP- 35) US towered airports, and vary by geographic region, as well as ethnic and cultural influences prevalent in each region. The data from this study may assist airport operators in identifying significant demographic characteristics that affect the outcomes of their driver training programs, and potential improvements that may enhance airport movement area driver training programs in various geographic regions...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of any software product over its lifetime is unavoidable, caused both by bugs {{to be fixed}} and by new requirements appearing in the later stages of the product’s lifecycle. Traditional development and architecture paradigms {{have proven to be}} not suited for these continual changes, resulting in large maintenance costs. This has caused the rise of approaches such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), based on loosely coupled, interoperable services, aiming to address these issues. This paper describes a case study of the {{evolution of}} an existing legacy system towards a more maintainable SOA. The proposed process includes the recovery of the legacy system architecture, as a first step to define the specific <b>evolution</b> <b>plan</b> to be executed and validated.

If evolution is not taken care of, the benefits of model-driven PLE (e. g., productivity gains, strategic reuse, complexity handling) {{will be difficult to}} achieve. In this paper we propose an approach for strategic planning and management of feature model evolution. Our approach includes a modelling framework that describes evolutionary changes of product lines using extended feature mod-els (called EvoFM), evolution plans, and fragments of models. Different versions of a feature model along the evolution path are considered to be “products ” that can be configured using the EvoFM. By using feature mod-els to document the <b>evolution</b> <b>plan</b> of feature models, we demonstrate an elegant solution to dealing with long term planning of changes to feature models. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of health systems is the financial protection against out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures.

We use the period from 20 May through 13 September 2007, MJDs 54240 - 54356, as the period before AEP. We use the interval from 14 September 2007 through 31 December 2007, MJDs 54357 - 5446 as the period after the implementation of AEP. We use a variance analysis to characterize performance, allowing us to characterize periodic behavior {{in the presence of}} power-law noise types. Computing the ratio of TDEV of various data after AEP implementation divided by the TDEV before the implementation allows us to see changes in deviation due to both power-law noise and periodic effects. We analyze two types of data for changes between these time periods: 1) error in broadcast ephemerides and clock corrections as combined for pseudoranges at NIST, Boulder, using National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) postprocessed estimates as the reference, and 2) the error of each satellite's broadcast ephemeris and clock model separately against the NGA estimates. Generally, we find evidence of some worsening in ephemerides from before to after the implementation of AEP. RMS 15 -minute stabilities across satellite blocks worsened by 8...|$|E

40|$|The United States ’ National Airspace System (NAS) {{contains}} {{a network of}} air transportation markets linking 485 commercial airports located in and around 363 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The total number of origin-destination (O&D) markets in the NAS ranges somewhere between 36, 000 – 40, 000 pairs depending upon seasons and economic cycles. This expansive network renders an annual commercial value of around $ 70 – $ 110 billion for scheduled and around $ 25 – 40 billion for unscheduled aviation services. Maintaining this network is expensive. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spends over $ 14 billion annually to fund facilities and equipment (F&E: approximately $ 3 billion), operations (approximately $ 7 billion), airports (approximately $ 3 billion), and research and engineering (approximately $ 0. 200 billion) expenditures.

40|$|Architecture {{evolution}} {{is a central}} feature of virtually all software systems. As new market opportunities, technologies, platforms, and frameworks become available systems must change their organizational structures to accommodate them, requiring large-scale and systematic restructuring. Today architects have few tools to help them plan and execute such evolutionary paths. In particular, they have almost no assistance in reasoning about questions such as: How should we stage the evolution to achieve business goals {{in the presence of}} limited development resources? How can we reduce risk in incorporating new technologies and infrastructure required by the target architecture? How can we make principled tradeoffs between time and development effort? What kinds of changes can be made independently, and which require coordinated system-wide modifications? How can an <b>evolution</b> <b>plan</b> be represented and communicated within an organization? In this report we outline first steps towards a formal basis for assisting architects in developing and reasoning about architectural evolution paths. The key insight behind the approach is that at an architectural level of abstraction many system evolutions follow certain common patterns – or evolution styles. By taking advantage of regularity in the space of common architectural evolutions, and by making the notion of evolutions styles a first-class entity that can be formally defined, we can provide automated assistance for expressing architecture evolution, and for reasoning about both the correctness and quality of evolution paths...|$|E
