5|$|Each year, 50,000vessels {{pass through}} Malacca Strait. In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} declared Sabang a Free Trade Zone and <b>Free</b> <b>Port,</b> to gain economic benefit by establishing the port as a logistic hub for international vessels {{passing through the}} strait. Infrastructures for a deep water harbour, port, warehousing and refuelling facilities, were developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of a port in Rijeka dates back to 1281, when the Great Council of the Republic of Venice {{reported}} a conflict of Venetian merchants and ship owners from Zadar and Rab. In 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and the first road connecting the port to the hinterland, the Caroline road, was completed in 1728. The inland connections were gradually improved by {{the construction of the}} Josephina and Louisiana roads in 1779 and 1810 respectively.|$|E
30|$|This paper aims rationalizing the {{complexity}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> It {{is based on a}} wide array of empirical observations and an analysis of structure, function and evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Collected <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> data enabled the identification of three constitutive factors of evolution: an external factor (the jurisdiction), an internal factor (the services provided) and a linking factor (the orientation of flows). Based on these three factors a model of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> was designed with a typology of thirteen types of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> an explanation of their evolution, and their future prospects.|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> along with globalization of trade is another major factor. The adaptation of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> to wider ranges of services {{in order to}} cope with evolutions of supply chains is another factor. Logistics functions of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> have become more complex and complete to cope with global supply chains and incorporate <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in the international trade system. Adding this factor explains {{a large part of}} the {{evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> but it does not cover the different types of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and especially the free trade zone system that is predominantly developed in OECD countries and the Export Processing Zone system that is only present in developing countries.|$|R
40|$|<b>Freeing</b> <b>ports</b> {{on fishing}} vessels are a {{significant}} safety feature. They are designed to reduce the build up of green water on deck {{that may lead to}} loss of stability. At a more mundane level they reduce wetness on decks that are the working platforms for the fishers. Wet decks that are moving working platforms are clearly a hazard. The present study deals more with the build up of water on deck rather than just general deck wetness. It attempts to quantify the amount of water on deck for different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations, using parameters such as number of <b>freeing</b> <b>ports,</b> <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> areas, deck area etc. The study uses numerical simulations to evaluate these parameters. One particular vessel has been used throughout the study, namely a typical fibreglass 65 foot fishing vessel of recent design. The main conclusions of the study are that generally there is not a great deal of difference between the amounts of water on deck for the different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations. Although larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> allow more water on deck if the ingress and egress of water flowing through the <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> is unhindered in both directions, for <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> fitted with some device (such as 2 ̆ 018 flaps 2 ̆ 019) that hinders the in-flow but not the out-flow then having larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> is shown to be beneficial. The benefits here are more to do with stability than general deck wetness. It is in fact clear from some of the results that larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> lead to wetter decks. The motions of the vessel in the study with water on deck have been evaluated and it is shown that different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations can lead to different motions of the vessel, particularly {{in the early stages of}} flooding.

5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt thanks to its <b>free</b> <b>port</b> status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political representation in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E
5|$|Vukassovich was {{instrumental}} in development of transport infrastructure in the present-day Croatian Littoral at {{the shores of the}} Adriatic Sea. His most significant contributions in the field were construction of roads after his designs. The first one was GospićKarlobag road, also known as Theresiana road, completed between 1784 and 1786which replaced an earlier route which comprised very steep grades limiting its capacity. The new road permitted setting up of a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> in Karlobag and significantly improved connection to the seaward slopes of Velebit. Currently, the route largely corresponds to the western section of the D25 road. The other major route Vukassovich designed was the Louisiana road between Karlovac and Rijeka with a branch serving Bakar. The road was built between 1803 and 1811, and the route is now used by the D3 road. Vukassovich also designed a coastal road between Senj and Sveti Juraj, port structures in Senj, and directed reconstruction of the Josephina road leading from Senj to Karlovac.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} decades, Singapore grew {{to become an}} important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including {{the opening of the}} Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships, the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. Its status as a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. The main commercial activity was entrepôt trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.|$|E
30|$|The historical, {{structural}} and functional analyses of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> mentioned above, {{made possible the}} identification of major factors describing {{the wide range of}} existing <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} thus underlines {{a functional}} and modal specialization of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are developed {{adjacent to a}} wide range of transport nodes, including sea ports, air ports, river ports, and dry ports (railyards). The relevance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is underlined by the increasing number of countries developing them and the amount of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) invested in these zones around the world (Farole, 2011).|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} organization, Lafargue (2008) points an {{evolution}} in the governance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> from publicly managed entities to landlord free zones, while Bost (2011) underlines the ongoing specialization of free zones to cater to specific supply chains. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving with the range of added value activities they provide from labor intensive to high value added products (Barbier and Véron, 1991). In the same manner, services offered by <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving to include ancillary services such as finance and insurance (Tiefenbrun, 2012). These organizational and marketing drivers represent the internal factors {{of the evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1593, the Ottoman Empire {{conquered the}} area that is now Odessa Oblast, and {{incorporated}} it as the Özü Eyalet, unofficially known as the Khanate of Ukraine. In {{the aftermath of the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1787–92, Yedisan, roughly corresponding to the modern city of Odessa, was recognised by the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Jassy as being a part of the Russian Empire. According to the first Russian Empire census of the Yedisan region, conducted in 1793 after the expulsion of the Nogai Tatars, forty-nine villages out of the sixty-seven between the Dniester River and the Southern Bug River were ethnically Romanian (also called Moldavians). Subsequently, ethnic Russians colonised the area, and established many new cities and ports. In 1819, the city of Odessa became a <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> It was home to a very diverse population, and was frequented by Black Sea traders. In less than a century, the city of Odessa grew from a small fortress to the biggest city in the region of New Russia.|$|E

30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> {{have also}} been a {{development}} tool for Asian economies. Bost (2010) underlined that a parallel exists between export-oriented industrialization {{and the use of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> For example, Taiwan and South Korea started export-oriented industrialization by setting their first free zones in Kaohsiung and Masan in the 1960 s (Amirahmadi and Weiping, 1995). When other Asian countries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the Philippines started to consider export-oriented development, they also implemented free zones. The recent setting of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in Madagascar, Morocco and Tunisia underlines a similar strategy (Lavissière, 2014).|$|R

30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are {{a form of}} {{territorial}} exceptionalism that has existed for centuries and become an important paradigm of globalization. In the contemporary setting, they act as transportation, logistics and trade platforms, using their territorial exceptionalism as a competitive advantage. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai are among the world’s leading commercial gateways, offering a form of leverage to transactions, transportation and the transformation of material goods. The historical evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> underlines a growing complexification and specialization {{that has led to}} a multitude of models, each fitting a specific regulatory and operational framework.|$|R
25|$|Penang Island was, since colonial times, a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> - {{until its}} sudden {{revocation}} by the Malaysian {{federal government in}} 1969. Penang subsequently suffered economic decline, {{with the loss of}} trade resulting in massive unemployment and brain drain.|$|E

25|$|On 9 September 1990, Doe {{visited the}} barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG {{headquarters}} in the <b>Free</b> <b>Port</b> of Monrovia. Stephen Ellis says, his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe’s visit to the <b>Free</b> <b>Port</b> are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson’s INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL’s Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.|$|E
30|$|From a {{historical}} {{point of view}} there is, therefore, a parallel evolution between the globalization of trade, the development of customs entities (cities, states, and customs unions) and <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> This evolution went from the protection of existing trade, the attraction of additional trade, to the connection to trade networks and, finally, to the competition between trade networks. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> have become an integration tool to global trade such as for East and Southeast Asian export-oriented economies. Further, <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> such as Dubai were established to try to capture the opportunities of being intermediary locations along long distance shipping routes.|$|R

Finally, outside general definitions, there is no typology of {{the different types of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> There is therefore the need {{for the development of a}} model of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> that would provide a better understanding of the phenomenon from a geographical, functional and evolutionary perspective.|$|R

30|$|The {{literature}} on <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is mostly focusing on their conditions {{of success and}} their impacts.

In the same way, legal (Blanc, 1996; Trampus, 1999), geographical (Bost, 2011; Yang, 2009) and social (Susman and Schneider, 2008) conditions brings light to favorable frameworks that help the development of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> The impacts of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> in their legal (Fedi and Lavissière, 2014; ILO/UNCTC, 1988), geographical (Bost, 2007), social (Barbier and Véron, 1991) and financial (Lu and Yang, 2007) aspects, have also been investigated. Major impacts listed are improvements in the connectivity of the port area, as well as attracting Foreign Direct Investments, logistics actors capitalizing on expanded trade flows and the dissemination of innovation and best practices among the workforce.|$|R
