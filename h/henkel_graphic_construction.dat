The fundamental property of any IFS is that image generated by it is also a fractal which is called attractor.

40|$|Autor nastavlja razmatranje o zaboravljenim proporcijama. U ovom radu govori o upotrebi latinskog križa u tlocrtu za proporcioniranje crkvi na Zapadu. O tom kanonu za izgradnju crkava razmatra se na primjerima grafita uklesanog na kamenom dovratku u Velom Grablju, srednjovjekovnih crkava, raspela iz Hvarske katedrale, slikanih raspela iz Umbrije, Splita i Cetinja te piramida u Gizi u Egiptu. In {{my paper}} „Forgotten canon - {{proportions}} for church building“ I {{spoke of the}} Byzantine canon, where the isosceles is an important element, and many Catholic churches have been designed by it. In the further meticulous work I have discovered that even Roman edifices like Pantheon ad Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s palace have been built according to it. In the article, {{which is part of}} my meticulous work on proportions, I present my study of proportions which appear out of a graffito discovery, carved in stone door-post which is on architrave door of the „Levanda“ restaurant in Velo Grablje on the island of Hvar. Graffito represents a proportional combination of constructing the Latin cross, namely, Romanic and Gothic churches of the West. In this proportion compound combination there is chequerboard scheme. We can see that the chequerboard is placed upon isosceles. This proportional compound discloses creation of one foot measure size and its parts and also that they are connected to the chequerboard and human body, which is inscribed within. I prove that Romanic Umbria crosses, the big Cetinje cross and the cross with the Crucified above the cathedral altar in Hvar, as well as the wood cross from Blaž Jurjev of Trogir in the church of St. Francis in Split, have been constructed by that compound. The ground floor map of the Hvar cathedral is also constructed after that proportional compound for constructing the Latin Cross. The Latin cross is {{in the center of the}} circle around the apse and on top of the Romanic Umbria cross God is represented in a small circle, i. e. God 2 ̆ 7 s hand in half of the circle on the top of the cross. This proportional compound is not a Medieval invention, because measuring in feet has been found in much earlier period. Greeks and Romans had been using it, and many a more before them we know nothing of. Pyramids at highlands of Gizah in Egypt prove it because they are constructed according to it too. Number Pi (Landolf number) and number Fi are hidden in the chequerboard, within the foot measure unit. If we divide number Pi with 13, we get the size of the smallest measure unit - a line. On grounds of the isosceles we can get, using <b>graphic</b> <b>construction,</b> the rest of the measure units, the foot being the biggest and that is at the same time the man 2 ̆ 7 s height. Using mathematics I proved that Bufon number is nothing but the foot measure. The whole number of protons and neutrons in amino acids creating DNA is 7920, the exact number of lines in eleven feet. This proves that measure units are mathematically linked to the man. By <b>graphic</b> <b>construction</b> and using the chequerboard I proved that the isosceles side is the size of the Pi. Number Pi is closely connected to the Cheops 2 ̆ 7 s pyramid, as visible from the pyramid construction in the proportional compound canon for church building 2, where the length defined by points S 2 - T 1 = Pi. Demonstrating <b>graphic</b> <b>construction</b> using number Fi, I constructed the Cheops 2 ̆ 7 s pyramid...|$|R

The choice of proper Bragg reflection for the rocking-curve measurements is shown to be of crucial importance. The <b>graphic</b> <b>construction</b> of the Ewald sphere is a useful aid for this purpose.

Qualitative analysis of rocking curves of P- and B-implanted Si samples was compared with electrical measurements and cross-section transmission electron micrographs. It could be established that the minimum implantation doses of P and B at energies ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 MeV, for which HR-XRD is sensitive enough, are about 1. 5 × 1014 cm¿ 2 and 5 × 1013 cm¿ 2 respectively.

40|$|The authors {{state the}} main aspects of {{innovative}} <b>construction</b> of form <b>graphics</b> {{of the structural}} geometric model of the Informative Hypercube produced using the universal Protocube-Designer method. The process of construction of the Info-Hypercube model {{is based on a}} well-known geometric transformation (motion) technique, i. e. spatial displacement of two components of the initial cubic model represented by a pair of trihedrons, which complies with a well-known phenomenon of geometric componenthood (PGC). The use of the Protocube-Designer is used to construct the Info-Hypercube model form graphics stage by stage, on the basis of which the internal structure of the Info-Hypercube is formed. The method of Protocube-Designer makes it possible to reduce the cube model into a plane octagonal structure for the production of the pr-matrix lattice. Then, the required transformation of the plane structure with a pr-matrix into a spatial cubic model is performed. Thus, the aforesaid pratrix is used here as a structural unit for the production of a form graphics space lattice. The final fill-in of the whole internal structure of the Info-Hypercube is performed through completion of six additional intersecting planes (plates) passing through the central Infocube in accordance with a typical one-side form graphics obtained earlier. The total number of planes in the internal Info-Hypercube structure will be equal to 18 (6 planes restricting the cubic form and 12 planes intersecting inside the model). As a result of this visual <b>graphic</b> <b>construction,</b> a rational formalized geometric Info-Hypercube model is obtained. This model represents an informative form graphics structure.

Need not only to inform students of {{a certain amount of}} knowledge on the subject, but also to develop their spatial imagination as well as the right to develop the skills of logical thinking. Practice of teaching the discipline showed that students face serious difficulties in the process of its study. This is due to the relatively low level of their schooling in geometry and technical drawing, and lacking in high spatial imagination. They find it difficult to imagine the geometrical image of the object of study and mentally convert it on the plane. Because of this, {{there is a need to}} find ways to effectively teach the discipline «Descriptive Geometry» at university. In the context of global informatization and computerization of the educational process, implementation of graphically programs for the development of design documentation and 3 D modeling is one of the most promising applications of information technology in the process of solving these problems.
