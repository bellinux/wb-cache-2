40|$|A symbol {{is unique}} {{as a form}} of {{communication}} in that it holds no meaning standing alone, but rather gains meaning by people. As such a symbol can sometimes lead one astray for its meaning is liquid. A symbol that once represented something beautiful can be used by a sinister group, and through that become an icon of evil. Such a symbol can be found here at Gettysburg College: the Swastika. I found this symbol decorating the floor tiles of the second floor entrance to Breidenbaugh Hall. What the symbol represents may not be as ambiguous as it may seem, as the Swastika has been around almost as long as man has, its significance ever changing. I had a hunch as to its meaning but in order to uncover what indeed was behind this symbol when it was first laid down I must examine multiple the conditions under which the building was constructed, and the times in which it was completed. I had an idea as to the meaning of the symbol in Breidenbaugh Hall before I started my research. The swastika <b>is</b> a symbol <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> around for a very long time, its common use beginning as early as 1000 B. C. 1 Needless to say, the symbol’s meaning changed over the years granting it volumes of uses. My <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> swastika on the floor of Breidenbaugh meant good luck.

5000|$|It {{was based}} on the first novel by Don Sharp. A {{reviewer}} from the Sydney Morning Herald described it as follows:This reviewer's <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story began as a film scenario, which could explain the precise, illustrative, uninspired style of the novel. Tasmanian-born Don Sharp has been in turn actor, broadcaster and film producer; and a background of that kind rarely favours the novel form. One sees its influence in sentences such as: [...] "The villagers greeted Sally conventionally"-a playwright's note of guidance to a producer, rather than a novelist's picture of a scene... Behind the quietly amusing account of this controversy storyline is the larger question whether English tradition must bow before the needs of national security, and Don Sharp debates it with intelligent sympathy. But the novel suffers because his characters are wooden and shaped to convenient patterns. It is as if they require to be brought to life by good actors in one of those rural settings which English film producers contrive so well.The Brisbane Telegraph thought the novel [...] "deserves to be welcomed with banners and trumpets. [...] "Conflict of Wings" [...] is innocent of fancy technique, and its simple prose seems to capture the cool, wind swept quality of the Norfolk marshes beloved by the author." ...|$|E

We present measures of the size of these shocks and discuss what a benchmark theory says about their immediate and ultimate consequences. We then provide a forecast based on a simple empirical model that captures the effects of wealth shocks and unemployment fears. Our short-term forecast calls for somewhat weaker spending, and somewhat higher saving rates, than the Consensus survey of macroeconomic forecasters.

40|$|The paper computes {{the effect}} of {{financial}} liberalization on economic growth by combining {{the results of a}} panel model with those of a probit model.

Surprisingly, we find that the net effect on growth is larger in the crisis-experienced country group than in the overall sample group. Our <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crisis-experienced countries are mostly developing countries that usually enjoy higher growth rates than the developed countries because of the catching-up phenomenon. The paper also studies the link between financial liberalization and nominal interest rates, and finds, contrary to expectations, that the direct liberalization effect is positive.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} the recent financial market turmoil for central banks. We start by characterizing the disruptions in the financial markets and compare these dislocations to previous periods of financial stress. We confirm the conventional view that the current problems in financial markets are concentrated in institutions that have exposure to mortgage securities. We use several methods to estimate the ultimate losses on these securities. Our best (very uncertain) <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> losses will total about $ 400 billion, with about half being borne by leveraged U. S. financial institutions. We then highlight the role of leverage and mark-to-market accounting in propagating this shock. This perspective implies an estimate of the eventual contraction in balance sheets of these institutions, which will include a substantial reduction in credit to businesses and households. We close by exploring the feedback from credit availability to the broader economy and provide new evidence that contractions in financial institutions balance sheets ’ cause a reduction in real GDP growth...|$|E

40|$|Computation is interpretable symbol manipulation. Symbols are {{objects that}} are {{manipulated}} {{on the basis of}} rules operating only on the symbols' shapes, which are arbitrary in relation to what they can be interpreted as meaning. Even if one accepts the Church/Turing Thesis that computation is unique, universal and very near omnipotent, not everything is a computer, because not everything can be given a systematic interpretation; and certainly everything can't be given every systematic interpretation. But even after computers and computation have been successfully distinguished from other kinds of things, mental states will not just be the implementations of the right symbol systems, because of the symbol grounding problem: The interpretation of a symbol system is not intrinsic to the system; it is projected onto it by the interpreter. This is not true of our thoughts. We must accordingly be more than just computers.

The question is how long this play will take to work itself out. Too long a delay means the prediction is almost worthless. My <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boom will continue over most of 2014 before crashing in 2015 as the economy tanks due to declining demand from China {{and the difficulty of}} increasing credit as a percentage of disposable income. The renewed boom has been associated with increasing concerns about housing affordability for younger buyers.

40|$|Within process industry, and in {{many other}} areas, the PID {{controller}} is responsible for handling regulatory control. An educated <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of executing PID control loops lies in the billions (2011) {{and there are no}} signs indicating a decrease of this number. Properly tuning the PID controller, i. e., setting its parameter values based on characteristics of the process it controls together with robustness criteria, is commonly both timely and costly. Hence, the tuning is often overseen, resulting in numerous poorly tuned loops. These result in unnecessary lack of performance, which might be both hazardous and uneconomic. If a linear time invariant model of the process is given, there exists numerous feasible tuning methods. However, automatically obtaining even a low complexity model is far from trivial {{in the absence of a}} priori process information. This thesis addresses system identification to be used in the automatic PID tuning procedure. A method for generating the identification input signal is proposed. Its objective is to yield higher model accuracy in the frequency range where it is most needed for robust tuning. Subsequently, methods for obtaining process models from input and output data pairs are proposed and discussed. All methods are presented using numerous simulations and laboratory experiments. Finally, a simulation study of closed-loop anesthesia in human patients, based on clinically obtained model parameters, is presented. The novelty lies in that the depth of hypnosis PID controller is individualized based on data collected during the induction phase of anesthesia. It is demonstrated that updating the controller, using a herein proposed method, significantly improves performance...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMid-latitude {{westerlies}} are a {{major component}} of the atmospheric circulation and understanding their behaviour under climate change is important for understanding changes in precipitation, storms and atmosphere-ocean momentum, heat and CO 2 exchanges. The Southern Hemisphere westerlies have been particularly studied in terms of the latter aspects, since the Southern Ocean is a key region for the global oceanic circulation as well as for CO 2 uptake. In this study, we analyse, mainly in terms of jet stream position, the behaviour of the southern westerlies for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 yr ago, which is the last past cold extreme) and for a future climate, obtained after stabilisation of the RCP 4. 5 scenario.
