5000|$|Sometimes {{called a}} check valve or a {{backflow}} preventer, a chemigation valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. [...] Most chemigation valves consist of a spring-loaded check valve, a low pressure drain, an air and vacuum relief valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve. Many chemigation valves also have a 4-inch <b>inspection</b> <b>port</b> so that a person can reach inside and feel if the check valve is still functional. Some governments {{require the use of}} two chemigation valves installed in series if hazardous chemicals are to be injected.|$|E
50|$|It {{does not}} share design and {{ergonomic}} commonalities with the striker-fired centerfire Ruger SR-Series pistols. Mechanically the SR22 significantly deviates from the other Ruger SR-Series pistols. In fact, it is more similar to something like a Walther P22 than a Ruger SR series pistol. The SR22 comes only in compact size, although recently a 4.5 inch barrel version was released. The SR22 is mainly targeted at plinking and competition shooting. The action of the SR22 is of the straight blowback type. It features a stainless steel barrel that is fixed to the frame. Furthermore, the SR22 features a double-action/single-action trigger system with a rounded-spur external hammer, and has a visual <b>inspection</b> <b>port</b> {{in the form of}} a hole in the top of the slide and the back of the barrel that functions as a loaded chamber indicator. The pistol is very lightweight thanks to its aluminum slide and polymer frame. The pistol also comes with interchangeable rubber grips for different-sized hands. The SR22 started to ship in January 2012 and is shipped with two single stack 10-round magazines and replaceable grips for small or large hands.|$|E

It is the first time an analysis on a combined dataset of this magnitude has been performed. Binary logistic regression is used to measure the effect of inspections on the probability of casualty, which can be measured for very serious casualties but not for serious or less serious casualties. In addition, the magnitude of improvement areas for targeting substandard vessels is determined and the models further show how targeting of substandard ships on a combined dataset can be improved.

40|$|Abstract. To {{meet the}} requirements, {{based on the}} {{provision}} of Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine(AQSIQ), of gas leakage monitoring inside dosing room of fumigant warehouse at the <b>inspection</b> and quarantine <b>port,</b> a fumigant gas trace detection system(FGTDS) based on photoionization detector(PID) is developed. The principle, structure and characteristic of the system design are especially demonstrated. The test data under different temperature, relative humidity(RH) and methyl bromide concentration demonstrate that the FGTDS based on PID can measure methyl bromide under very low concentration. A conclusion can be drawn that the requirements of gas leakage monitoring inside dosing room of fumigation warehouse at the <b>inspection</b> and quarantine <b>port</b> can be met through further proper design...|$|R

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{improvements in}} reliability of launch vehicles is traced from the Vanguard rocket to the STS. The Vanguard, built with minimal redundancy {{and a high}} mass ratio, {{was used as an}} operational vehicle midway through its test program in an attempt to meet the perceived challenge represented by the Sputnik. The fourth Vanguard failed due to inadequate contamination prevention and lack of <b>inspection</b> <b>ports.</b> Automatic firing sequences were adopted for the Titan rockets, which were an order of magnitude larger than the Vanguard and therefore had room for interior inspections. Qualification testing and reporting were introduced for components, along with X ray inspection of fuel tank welds. Dual systems were added for flight critical components when the Titan became man-rated for the Gemini program. Designs incorporated full failure mode effects and criticality analyses for the Apollo program, which exposed the limits of applicability of numerical reliability models. Fault tree analyses and program milestone reviews were initiated. The worth of man-in-the-loop in space activities for reliability was demonstrated with the rescue of Skylab after solar panel and meteoroid shield failures. It is now the reliability of the payload, rather than the vehicle, that is questioned for Shuttle launches...|$|R
