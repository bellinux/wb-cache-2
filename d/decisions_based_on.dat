5|$|Laboratory (brown) rats {{may have}} the {{capacity}} for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then make <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the patient's genotype.|$|E

5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he was making his starting goaltender <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and they would do what was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated he flipped it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E

25|$|The third {{step from}} {{political}} economy to economics was {{the introduction of}} marginalism and the proposition that economic actors made <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> margins.
