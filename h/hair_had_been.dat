25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of 28 people were unearthed at Masada. The {{remains of a}} male 20–22 years of age, a female 17–18, and a child about 12 years old {{were found in the}} palace. The remains of two men and a full head of hair with braids belonging to a woman were also found in the bath house. Forensic analysis showed the <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> cut from the woman's head with a sharp instrument while she was still alive (an old practice for captured women) while the braids indicated that she was married. Based on the evidence, anthropologist Joe Zias believes the remains may have been Romans whom the rebels captured when they seized the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{pubic hair}} that Christie {{collected}} from his victims, {{it has been}} speculated that {{he was responsible for}} more murders than those carried out at 10Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons, there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> removed from her body.|$|E
25|$|On arrival, Riis {{found that}} the rumor was true {{but that he had}} arrived too late. He pleaded with the French consul, who {{expelled}} him. He made various other attempts to enlist, none successful. As autumn began, Riis was destitute, without a job. He survived on scavenged food and handouts from Delmonico's Restaurant and slept in public areas or in a foul-smelling police lodging-house. At one time Riis's only companion was a stray dog. One morning he awoke in a lodging-house to find that his gold locket (with its strand of Elisabeth's <b>hair)</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stolen. He complained to the sergeant, who became enraged and expelled him. Riis was devastated. The story became a favorite of Riis's. One of his personal victories, he later confessed, was not using his eventual fame to ruin the career of the offending officer. Disgusted, he left New York, buying a passage on a ferry with the silk handkerchief that was his last possession. By doing odd jobs and stowing away on freight trains, Riis eventually reached Philadelphia, where he appealed to the Danish Consul, Ferdinand Myhlertz, for help and was cared for two weeks by the Consul and his wife.|$|E

500|$|The {{journey to}} Oklahoma began in May 1877 and took 70 days. [...] A few Indians fled the agency {{when the news}} was announced, amongst them Wooden Leg's brother Yellow Hair. [...] While in Oklahoma Wooden Leg {{received}} news that Yellow <b>Hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed by white men while out hunting. [...] Wooden Leg hunted on the reservation, {{but there was no}} large game to be had and the Indians were not allowed to leave. [...] Nor were they being fed as promised, and there was much sickness. [...] Little Wolf campaigned for action, and eventually he and Dull Knife led much of the tribe off the reservation to fight their way back North.|$|E
500|$|In {{seeking to}} find who had {{set fire to}} the Farrar–Green home, {{investigators}} looked first for physical evidence of fire-setting upon those {{who had been in the}} house. They suspected that because of the use of accelerant, the fire may have flashed over at the point of ignition and singed or burned the setter. Accordingly, they tested clothing worn by both Farrar and Green that night and took samples of the hair of both. Neither Green's nor Farrar's clothing showed evidence of having been in contact with accelerant; Farrar's hair showed no singeing, but Green's—which had been cut twice between the time of the fire and the time the police took hair samples from her—showed [...] "significant singeing". Detectives recalled that Green had denied ever having been in close proximity to flames; she had reported leaving the house after seeing smoke and not coming into contact with the fire either on the deck outside her bedroom or in the process of coaxing Kate off the garage roof. Neighbors of the family reported that when Green had come to their door to ask them to call for help, her <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wet. Though their suspicions pointed to Debora Green, investigators continued to receive tips attributing the fire to any number of people and the investigation continued with no public statement about suspects.|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen {{spoke with her}} friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down her throat, and her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. [...] You want to pretend that they're just an object".|$|E

60|$|The accusings and upbraidings {{thickened}} upon him, but Dylks sat silent, {{except for}} a low groan {{of what might have}} seemed remorse. He put his hand to the place on his head where the <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> torn away, and looked at the blood on his fingers.|$|E

50|$|While she {{was active}} in voter {{protection}} before her time with Advancement Project, <b>Hair</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> vigilant {{in the most recent}} wave of voter suppression tactics, many which emerged in 2011 and have spread further since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on Shelby. The ruling removed preclearance of new, potentially problematic voting laws for several states that had historically used voter suppression tactics on communities of color.

60|$|His face, now shaven smooth, seemed transformed. His <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> combed, and it {{fell back}} from {{the right side of}} his {{forehead}} with a peculiar wave. The moonlight charitably softened the ravages of drink; and his aquiline, well-shaped nose and small, square cleft chin almost gave distinction to his looks.|$|E
60|$|In {{a wonderfully}} short space of time her <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{reformed}} in its usual loops. The {{upper half of}} her body now became dark green with black stripes on it; the skirt, however, needed hooking at various angles, and Rachel had to kneel on the floor, fitting the eyes to the hooks.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{looked up from}} his work. He was greatly changed during the last few hours.

60|$|The truth was, Miss Kite was {{impatient}} {{to have a}} look at herself in the glass, in her own room with the door shut.

6000|$|She {{closed the}} door on him abruptly, leaving him a little {{surprised}} in the street. [...] "Ma!"

It seemed but an instant, but she was changed; the arms had vanished into sleeves, the apron had gone, a certain pleasing disorder of the <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at least reproved.|$|E
50|$|Cooper {{also notes}} that the {{painting}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> slightly altered.
