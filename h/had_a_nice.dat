5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E

But Ramakrishna in contrast did not have a formal education.But, they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> relation between them. When Ramkrishna met Vidyasagar, he praised Vidyasagar as the ocean of wisdom. Vidyasagar joked that Ramkrishna should have collected some amount of salty water of that sea. But, Ramakrishna, with profound humbleness & respect, replied that the water of general sea might be salty, but not the water of the sea of wisdom.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka {{were the}} {{favorite}} {{from the beginning}} of the tournament since they were the hosts. They made a flying start against Zimbabwe. They thrashed Zimbabwe and won by 82 runs. But they lost to South Africa by 32 runs (D/L Method) to finish second to South Africa in Group C and qualified for the Super 8 stage. Though the system of ICC World Twenty20 made them C1 of that group. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> and smooth journey at Super 8 stage. They won comfortably against West Indies and England. But their first match at super 8 against New Zealand was a thriller where the result of the match was decided by super over and Sri Lanka won. They qualified for the semi final by being the topper of Group 1 with 3 wins in 3 matches. In the semi final they faced Pakistan. They won by 16 runs to qualify for the final of 2012 ICC World Twenty and their second world twenty20 final.|$|E

500|$|The {{departure}} {{and split}} with the Maharishi was well-publicised. In Delhi, Lennon and Harrison told the reporters {{that they had}} urgent business in London {{and they did not}} want to appear in the Maharishi's film. Back in the UK the band members said that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi's desire for financial gain. McCartney said that [...] "Rishikesh was a good experience. I enjoyed it". Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, [...] "We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene", and, [...] "We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us". Lennon went on to say: [...] "I don't know what level he's on but we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> holiday in India and came back rested." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{criticized the}} espresso subplot and the episode in general, {{for the lack}} of {{authority}} in the office, due to Jim, Andy and Pam leaving the office. She also called the plot too similar to the season five episode, [...] "Cafe Disco". She complimented the use of the ensemble players throughout the plot and praised the Dwight-Clark storyline, comparing it positively to the season three episode, [...] "Traveling Salesmen". She also compared the Jim-Darryl-Pam storyline to the style of the early seasons, writing that it [...] "was the stuff of classic office, making you cringe as you are forced watch someone digging a hole deeper and deeper for himself". She gave the episode a 7.5/10, calling it [...] "Good". Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and praised the use of the whole ensemble cast. He also complimented the build-up towards a future conflict between Jim and Pam, and said that while he is [...] "still waiting for the show to hit the gravitational pull of wrapping up" [...] and that the show [...] "probably should have ended three years ago", the episode was still good. New York writer Michael Tedder wrote that the episode <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> balance of cringe humor, particularly in Darryl's job interview for Athlead. He also praised the set-up for the Dwight-Clark subplot, saying that the plotline was perfect for their dynamic and could not work with previous seasons. He was also complimentary towards the espresso subplot and gave the episode four out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gamasutra in June 2008, Gilbert stated that DeathSpank would be an episodic series of games. [...] On March 30, 2009, [...] Ron Gilbert confirmed on his blog that the game {{would no longer be}} episodic. [...] Gilbert later revealed that the game had once again become episodic due to the game's size. [...] "Towards the end of production it was determined what we had built was too big for a downloadable game, so {{the decision was made to}} split the game in half and the climactic battle with Lord Von Prong was the perfect place. [...] That battle is in essence the end of Act I and it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> WTF moment that provided a nice cliff hanger" [...] he stated. [...] Gilbert has described DeathSpank as being [...] "Act I" [...] in his story, and Thongs of Virtue as being [...] "Acts II and III".|$|E

2500|$|The group's members {{first met}} {{in the year of}} 1987, when Sakurai, Tahara and Nakagawa were in [...] The Walls, which was {{originally}} influenced by the band Echoes. The frontman of Echoes, Jinsei Tsuji, was a political activist, and because of this, The Walls too became a political band. Drummer Hideya Suzuki was not an original member of The Walls. When the original drummer departed, the band recruited Suzuki, who went to the same school as the other members. In late 1988, The Walls disintegrated, while the remaining members formed Mr. Children in early 1989. The name of Mr. Children supposedly came about during a talk in a dinner, in which the group thought the word [...] "children" [...] <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ring to it, but because they were no longer children themselves, they decided to add Mr. in front of it. They credit this change as a new way they started to look at the group.|$|E
2500|$|Looking {{to break}} into production, Thomas wrote to Beatles {{producer}} George Martin seeking work and in 1967 was employed as an assistant by AIR, an independent production company which had been founded by Martin and three other EMI producers. Thomas was allowed to attend sessions at EMI with the Hollies and, in 1968, The Beatles during their sessions for the White Album. Midway through the sessions, Martin {{decided to take a}} vacation, and he proposed that Thomas assume his duties as producer. [...] "I had just come back from holiday myself, and when I came in there was a little letter on the desk that said, [...] "Dear Chris, Hope you <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> holiday.

[...] Thomas produced [...] "Birthday" [...] and [...] "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" [...] and played keyboards on four songs: Mellotron on [...] "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill", piano on [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] and [...] "Savoy Truffle", and harpsichord on [...] "Piggies".|$|E
2500|$|Ed Roberts had {{designed}} and manufactured programmable calculators and {{was familiar with}} the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact two microcomputers based on the Intel 8008 were already on the market: The Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel's main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to computer companies. They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at $360 (About $1,700 in 2014 dollars). [...] "That figure <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ring to it," [...] recalled Intel's Dave House in 1984. [...] "Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so we felt it was a reasonable price." [...] Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of calculator chips {{and he was able to}} negotiate a $75 price (about $350 in 2014 dollars) for the 8080 microprocessor chips.|$|E

2500|$|The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was {{developed}} {{for the purpose of}} performing these same ballistics calculations between 1943–1946. In June 1945, Kay was selected to be one of its first programmers, along with several other women from the computer corps: Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, and Ruth Lichterman, and a fifth computer named Helen Greenman (nicknamed [...] "Greenie"). When Greenie declined to go to Aberdeen for training because she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> apartment in West Philadelphia and a 1st alternate refused to cut short a vacation in Missouri, Betty Jean Jennings, the 2nd alternate, got the job, and between June and August 1945 they received training at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the IBM punched card equipment that was to be used as the I/O for the ENIAC. (Later, Kay's college schoolmate and fellow computer Fran Bilas would join the team of ENIAC programmers at the Moore School, though she did not attend the initial training at Aberdeen.) The computer could complete the same ballistics calculations described above in about 10 seconds, but it would often take one or two days to set the computer up for a new set of problems, via plugs and switches. It was the women's responsibility to determine the sequence of steps required to complete the calculations for each problem and set up the ENIAC according; early on, they consulted with ENIAC engineers such as Arthur Burks to determine how the ENIAC could be programmed.|$|E
