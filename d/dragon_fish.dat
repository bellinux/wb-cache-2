50|$|The deep-sea dragonfish has {{a special}} {{characteristic}} from most of its fellow deep-sea creatures. Most deep sea fish that can produce light produce blue light, but the <b>dragon</b> <b>fish</b> can produce not only blue light but a red light as well. This red light is emitted from a suborbital photophore. In order to see this red color, these dragonfish have two different visual pigments.This characteristic is only found in three genera of dragonfish: Malacosteus, Aristostomias, and Pachystomias. As a result, they are carnivores.|$|E

5000|$|If {{personnel}} {{become in}} {{direct contact with}} fallout, beta burns from shallow ionizing beta radiation will be experienced, the largest particles (visible to the naked eye) in local fallout would be likely to have very high radioactivity because they would be deposited so soon after detonation; this fraction of the total fallout is called the prompt or local fallout fraction. It is likely that one such particle upon the skin would be able to cause a localized beta burn. This local fallout, termed Bikini snow after the Pacific island weapon tests, was experienced by the crew {{on the deck of the}} Lucky <b>Dragon</b> <b>fishing</b> ship following the explosion of the 15 megaton Shrimp device in the Castle Bravo event. However, these particular decay particles (beta particles) are very weakly penetrating and have a short range, requiring almost direct contact between fallout and personnel to be harmful.|$|R

5000|$|The Deep-sea Dragonfish, as {{the name}} states, lives in the deep-sea of the Atlantic ocean. The <b>Dragon</b> <b>fish</b> tends to live around 1500 to 4500meters below the surface. [...] Some Dragonfish have even been found at depths of 5000 meters. At these depths, the {{conditions}} are very extreme. The pressure can range from 200 to 600 atmospheres (atm) and the temperatures fall just below four degrees Celsius. The Dragonfish lives below the Bathyal zone where no light reaches. The Bathyal zone starts at about 220 meters. Past this point, there is no light, and it is deep enough to not be affected by storms or ocean currents, making the environment where the dragonfish lives utterly still.|$|E
5000|$|To {{deal with}} the pressures, the <b>dragon</b> <b>fish</b> has a very minimalized {{skeleton}} except for the jaws and other parts used for feeding. They have large, recurved teeth that can either be tightly bound or hinged, allowing them to fall inward while eating, depending on the species. [...] The dragonfish also has {{a second set of}} jaws located in the branchial basket, which houses the gills as well as this second set of jaws. [...] The dragonfish has a very odd characteristic in that certain genera of dragonfish are missing the two through seven vertebras in their spine. [...] This {{has been found to be}} due to the developmental characteristics of the dragonfish. [...] In most fish, the spine develops from head to tail, but in dragonfish it develops in the opposite direction. [...] These missing vertebras allow the dragonfish to have an increased flexibility in their head, allowing them to eat larger prey. [...] The dragonfish, like other deep-sea predators, have light producing organs called Photophores along their body and on a flesh like extension of the lower jaw called a barbell. [...] These photophores are also found on the pectoral fins. [...] The dragonfish, unlike most fish, has a scaleless body. Their body has a slimy, flesh-like outside very similar to an eel.|$|E
40|$|Most {{species of}} deep-sea fish possess of a rod-only retina with a pigment that is {{generally}} shortwave shifted in λmax towards the blue {{region of the}} spectrum.

50|$|The Royal Tomb of King Tongmyong and the Three Tombs of Kangso have mural {{paintings}}. The Tomb of King Tongmyong has Koguryo murals {{which are}} known for its rich color and tone. The wall paintings found in the tomb were of Buddhist themes, namely the lotus, and the animal depictions in the ceiling and walls of the tombs. The murals depict, realistically in a three-dimensional form, the daily life scenes of people such as women dancing, warriors getting trained, birds flying in the sky covered with clouds, <b>dragons,</b> <b>fish</b> swimming in rivers, and wild life. The frescoes in the tomb depict lotuses in blossom with other religious ornamentation which bring out the traditional Buddhist ethos only and not the four traditional images of the constellations as in the Chinese tombs. This is inferred to represent the paradise in Buddhist religious parlance. The tomb has an inscription which substantiates {{the fact that it}} was a sacred site for tomyong festival rites. These consisted of the worship of mother earth and also livestock; the former is a south Asian rite while the latter is a shamanistic form of worship.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese longma [...] "dragon horse" [...] is not culture specific. Mythological hybrid {{animals or}} chimeras are known worldwide, {{including}} combinations of dragons and horses. In Greek mythology, the Hippocamp or Hippocampus (lit. [...] "horse sea-monster"), which supposedly has {{the head and}} front legs of a horse and the hindquarters of a <b>dragon</b> or <b>fish,</b> parallels the longma (Carr 1990:154). In Babylonian mythology, [...] "dragon-horse" [...] is a title of the goddess Tiamat (Massey 1907:274). Among the prehistoric hill figures in Oxfordshire, Dragon Hill is below the Uffington White Horse.|$|R
50|$|Suijin (water god) is the Shinto god {{of water}} in Japan.The term Suijin (literally water people or water deity) refers to the heavenly and earthly manifestations of the benevolent Shinto divinity of water. But it also refers {{to a wide variety}} of mythological and magical creatures found in lakes, ponds, springs and wells, {{including}} serpents (snakes and <b>dragons),</b> eels, <b>fish,</b> turtles, and the flesh-eating kappa. As The God of Water, Mizu no Kamisama, Mizugami, or Suijin, he is widely revered in Japan. He is a big part of Japanese culture and is often worshiped in temples.|$|R
40|$|Retinal is the light-absorbing {{chromophore}} that {{is responsible}} for the activation of visual pigments and light-driven ion pumps. Evolutionary changes in the intermolecular interactions of the retinal with specific amino acids allow for adaptation of the spectral characteristics, referred to as spectral tuning. However, it has been proposed that a specific species of <b>dragon</b> <b>fish</b> has bypassed the adaptive evolutionary process of spectral tuning and replaced it with a single evolutionary event: photosensitization of rhodopsin by chlorophyll derivatives. Here, by using a combination of experimental measurements and computational modeling to probe retinal-receptor interactions in rhodopsin, we show how the binding of the chlorophyll derivative, chlorin-e 6 (Ce 6) in the intracellular domain (ICD) of the receptor allosterically excites G-protein coupled receptor class A (GPCR-A) conserved long-range correlated fluctuations that connect distant parts of the receptor. These long-range correlated motions are associated with regulating the dynamics and intermolecular interactions of specific amino acids in the retinal ligand-binding pocket that have been associated with shifts in the absorbance peak maximum (λmax) and hence, spectral sensitivity of the visual system. Moreover, the binding of Ce 6 affects the overall global properties of the receptor. Specifically, we find that Ce 6 -induced dynamics alter the thermal stability of rhodopsin by adjusting hydrogen-bonding interactions near the receptor active-site that consequently also influences the intrinsic conformational equilibrium of the receptor. Due to the conservation of the ICD residues amongst different receptors in this class and the fact that all GPCR-A receptors share a common mechanism of activation, {{it is possible that the}} allosteric associations excited in rhodopsin with Ce 6 binding are a common feature in all class A GPCRs...|$|E
