25|$|Uemura then {{prepared}} to climb Denali again solo in winter. The difficulty of a winter ascent {{will be difficult}} to understand for people unfamiliar with Alaskan climbing, and nobody had successfully climbed any large Alaskan peak in winter until 1967, when Gregg Blomberg organized an expedition that <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Denali (Blomberg himself did not summit). This team lost one member {{and the rest of them}} almost died in a storm on the way down. Team member Art Davidson's book about the climb was named after that storm — Minus 148°.|$|E
25|$|Mount Hood {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{mountains}} Rusk saw when he and his family came from Illinois; however, he did not get to climb it until much later, in 1922. This climb he made solo up the Cooper Spur route. Once he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> he spent a long time with the fire lookout, Charles A. Phelps, who regaled him of many his adventures as the lookout. On the way back down, Rusk had one of his few climbing accidents, losing his footing and sliding quickly down the slope for a short distance.|$|E
25|$|The Koppenberg {{has been}} dropped some years {{because it was}} deemed too {{difficult}} and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, {{it was hard for}} riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder their bikes and run up the remainder of the hill. In 1984 only two riders– Phil Anderson and Jan Raas– <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> on their bikes. In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on the slick cobbles, before being run over by an official's car who tried to pass him. The climb was subsequently banned from the Tour of Flanders for the next 15 years.|$|E
50|$|In The Eliminator, {{both teams}} were nearly neck and neck, but Tahny {{made it into}} the lead for Venom. They both found it hard <b>to</b> get up <b>the</b> waterfall, but both got up still nearly tied. Once they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> net, Eilidh's small size made her slower to get up and Imani started having bad asthma. Tahny {{motivated}} her to keep going and both Suki and Tahny <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> first. Eilidh was still slowly getting up but Imani <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> released <b>the</b> coloured balls and Venom won.|$|R

500|$|The race got on its {{way under}} cloudy but dry conditions. The Tour de Suisse was {{featuring}} the Gotthard Pass for the 34th time in its history, and a break formed along its early slopes, which featured cobbles. The two attackers were Stefan Denifl (IAM Cycling) and Marco Marcato (Wanty-Groupe Gobert). The pair had a lead of 2' 30" [...] on the main field as Branislau Samoilau (CCC-Sprandi-Polkowice) was chasing them. Denifl <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the climb first to rake in twenty points. By {{the top of the}} pass, snow was covering the sides of the road and the field was 3' 20" [...] back. The riders put gilets on before the descent, which lasted almost [...] Samoileau succeeded in joining the escape during the downhill.|$|E

He said, [...] "I thought I was a goner." [...] He reached {{the surface of the}} water by {{removing}} his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. During the ordeal, he remembers how he felt: [...] "I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. When I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 82-30's {{operation}} and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's , which depended {{much on the}} use of suction to hold the pins in a double-sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around the heads of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten [...] "pindicator" [...] lights – pioneered by AMF in May 1953 – in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the pinspotter's masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins.|$|E
