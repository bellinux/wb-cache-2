Do {{you really}} want every time they pass the basket in your church, and you throw a buck in, they run over and say, '...where do you come from? ... Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> money?' No." [...] The TV news anchor Rick Sanchez said: [...] "...if you start going into who is giving money to whom ... {{you have to go}} to my church. You have got to go to Rome and start asking where the money is going into Rome. And {{you have to go to}} the Mormons and ask them, well, what are they doing with their money?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The youngster {{introduced}} as the K. C. Kid piped up, truculently: [...] "Say, where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> moral stuff? This ain't a Sunday-school picnic; it's a hoboes' camp." ...|$|R

6000|$|Gerald tasted {{his black}} coffee. [...] "If it's not bad form, where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this?</b> There's {{nothing of the}} kind in Cumberland, and it's better than the Turkish they give you in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once," [...] replied Hal. [...] "Louis Woodhull got one on that Swift River trip a {{year ago}} last fall. But when <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> fellow, and why have you kept so mum about it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... (The {{exchange}} referenced {{was between}} two potential successors Shenxiu and Huineng. Shenxiu {{to demonstrate his}} mastery of Zen wrote the following poem: The body is the Bodhi Tree \ the mind like a clear mirror. \ Always wipe it clean, \ don't let it gather dust.

Her voice roused him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you might}} have a touch at the wine-merchant and purveyor.

The voluptuous Bart answered, 'At So-and-So's, or So-and-So's.' The answer is obvious. You may furnish your cellar or your larder in this way. Begad, Snooks! I lick my lips at the very idea.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I motored {{down with}} a boy I know. We had a {{breakdown}} just outside the gates. We {{were on our way}} to Brighton for lunch. He suggested I should pass the time seeing the sights while he fixed up the sprockets or the differential gear or whatever it was. He's coming to pick me up when he's through. But, on the level, George, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> way? <b>You</b> sneak out of town and leave the show flat, and nobody has a notion where you are. Why, we were thinking of advertising for you, or going to the police or something. For all anybody knew, you might have been sandbagged or dropped in the river." ...|$|R

6000|$|When {{there were}} cards, {{there was always}} a little supper: a lobster and a roasted potato and that sort of easy thing, and curious drinks, which the sisters mixed and made, and which no one else, at least all said so, could mix and make. On fitting {{occasions}} a bottle of champagne appeared, and then the person for whom the wine was produced was sure with wonderment to say, [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> champagne, Rodney? Could you get me some?"

But people say, [...] "If you want to do any one good, don't do him good only, do him evil also, and there will be peace between you." [...] So, mother, I have done: I want to see the favours I have done to my master, that he may do me the like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} too long a tale," [...] said Heyst with a faint smile. Heyst's smiles were rather melancholy, and accorded badly with his great moustaches, under which his mere playfulness lurked as {{comfortable}} as a shy bird in its native thicket. [...] "Much too long. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> amongst <b>this</b> lot here?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Hethcote's {{opinions}} of Socialists {{began to show}} themselves (a little sourly) in Mr. Hethcote's smile.

5000|$|... "If Its Real" [...] is the Liverpool-based band Space's debut single, {{released}} only on 12" [...] vinyl in 1993 under a {{restriction of}} 500 copies.

6000|$|Anacreon {{talks to}} the point so well that you must forgive him, I think, for being Anacreontic, and take from his hands what is not defiled.
