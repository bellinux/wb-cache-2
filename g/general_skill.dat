25|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of statistical learning was first discovered {{in the context of}} language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain <b>general</b> <b>skill</b> and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.,. Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).|$|E

500|$|The final Test at The Oval saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain {{affected}} pitch. Lindwall had Compton dismissed before lunch after Morris {{had taken a}} difficult catch. After the break, England had struggled to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. He then had Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Jack Young all yorked {{in the space of}} two runs. The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon, who caught the ball one handed at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch {{as one of the best}} he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets for eight runs, finishing with 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as [...] "the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". After Australia had replied with 389, England were bowled out for 188 in their second innings, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to give him 9/70 for the match. He ended the series as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83. The English were unable to cope with his swing, with 43 of his wickets coming after the batsmen had missed the ball and were bowled. For the entire tour, Lindwall took 86 wickets at 15.68 and scored 405 runs at 24.17. Lindwall's Test haul of 27 scalps equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler in England. Wisden recognised him by naming him as one of its five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949, citing his ability to allow Australia to seize the initiative in all but one of the Tests by achieving early breakthroughs against their batting. Wisden said that [...] "by whatever standard he is judged", Lindwall must [...] "be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers", attributing his success to [...] "superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and <b>general</b> <b>skill,</b> the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning". The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opposing batsmen to retreat onto the back foot even before he had released the ball.

30|$|A {{shortcoming}} {{of quantitative}} matching {{is that it}} fails to capture whether education-related skills match those required in employment. A worker could have a similar level of schooling as his/her colleagues but may have acquired very different, possibly irrelevant, occupational skills.

Through formal education, students acquire a bundle of <b>general</b> and specific <b>skills.</b> <b>General</b> <b>skills</b> are transferable across occupations, while specific skills are important only in particular occupations. Students, who acquire credentials in fields such as business administration, acquire relatively more <b>general</b> <b>skills</b> compared to students who acquire certificates in engineering or in the skilled trades.

50|$|Also {{concerning}} {{the role of}} education in acquiring skills, people are now required to receive more education and earn higher degrees {{in order to get}} jobs than they have in the past. For example, many nurses are now required to have a bachelor's degree in nursing in order to work, which increases the enrollment in nursing courses at four-year colleges, as well as forcing many to return to school in order to fulfill the requirements.They have even opened programs for people who are already registered nurses, so that they can earn bachelor's degrees. Not only are workers having to earn more degrees to find jobs than before, but with the increasing role of new technology in the workplace, workers must be more specialized in their skills as well. We are entering an age of hyper-specialization, meaning that companies are now more frequently subdividing labor into complex networks of individual, specialized tasks. Because employers are looking for more specialized skill sets, people are required to develop more highly specialized skills. This makes it more difficult to find jobs, especially for older workers who are not as familiar with modern technology and specializing in specific skills. In the past, people have been able to have a more <b>general</b> <b>skill</b> set that encompasses many aspects of a business, but now they must be highly specialized in one or two specific skills. Although it remains consistent that the more skillful a worker is, the higher their wages will be, the role of skills in the workplace has transformed over time to require more education and more specialized skill, making it even more difficult to bridge the racial and gender wage and employment gaps.|$|E
