30|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{systems of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> as tools {{for the organization}} of multi-agent systems. Systems of <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> are defined {{on the basis of}} the theory of social exchanges, developed by Piaget and Homans. A model of social organization is proposed, where social relations are construed as social <b>exchanges</b> and <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> are put into use in the support of the continuity of the performance of social exchanges. The dynamics of social organizations is formulated in terms of the regulation of <b>exchanges</b> of <b>values,</b> so that social equilibrium is connected to the continuity of the interactions. The concept of supervisor of social equilibrium is introduced as a centralized mechanism for solving the problem of the equilibrium of the organization The equilibrium supervisor solves such problem making use of a qualitative Markov Decision Process that uses numerical intervals for the representation of <b>exchange</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R

25|$|The more {{production}} {{comes to}} rest on <b>exchange</b> <b>value,</b> hence on exchange, the more important do the physical conditions of exchange — the means of communication and transport — become for the costs of circulation.

25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, {{and if it}} is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an <b>exchange</b> <b>value,</b> most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E

50|$|In volumes I and II of Capital, Marx usually {{assumed that}} <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> were equal to values, and that prices were {{proportional}} to values.

However, he was quite conscious {{of the distinction between}} the empirical and microeconomic concept of prices (or <b>exchange</b> <b>values)</b> and the social concept of value. In fact he completed the draft of volume 3 of Das Kapital, before he published volume 1.|$|R

25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War I, once fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange. At {{the onset of the}} war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the <b>exchange</b> <b>value</b> of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system of}} values for modelling social exchanges among agents in an artificial society. The system consists of an algebra of <b>exchange</b> <b>values,</b> a social-reasoning mechanism based on that algebra, and the specification of structures for storing and manipulating such values. The notion of <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> used here is the one defined in J. Piaget’s sociology of small groups, which provides a simple theoretical framework for our endeavour. We show how the system can be integrated with existing interaction models in multi-agent systems. We also illustrate the use of our value-based system by a brief model {{of the political process}} of lobbying through campaign contributions...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} radon in groundwater {{was used}} to test radon mixing models. Two different mixing models were used to quantify groundwater fluxes to streams; an analytical solution and a finite difference method. Two different bodies of waters were used in this study. The first location was Johnson Creek located in Grant-Kohrs Ranch in Deer Lodge, Montana. This is a small creek where lots of sampling points were taken. The stretch of Johnson Creek where radon samples were collected was about 0. 34 km long with a flowrate between 0. 01 m 3 /s and 0. 017 m 3 /s. The second location was Merced River located in Yosemite Valley (Yosemite National Park) in the state of California. This is a much larger river compared to Johnson Creek, and also had fewer sampling points. The reach looked at in this study is from Happy Isles to Pohono Bridge, a 17. 3 km distance with a flowrate that ranges between 0. 20 m 3 /s and ~ 120 m 3 /s at Happy Isles depending on the time of the year. To test the models, both bodies of water were known to have groundwater gains meaning that back calculations for gas <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> could be derived. The finite difference method was found to have errors that are still undetermined. The average gas <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> for radon in the analytical model tested were between 154. 6 day- 1 to 195. 6 day- 1 for Johnson Creek and 2. 7 day- 1 to 3. 5 day- 1 for Merced River. Johnson Creek’s gas <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> for radon compare well to published sites. Merced River gas <b>exchange</b> <b>values</b> for radon are low in comparison to past studies on gas exchange; this could be due to the long reach with few sampling points...|$|R
