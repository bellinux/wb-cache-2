40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} further {{education}} of deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people.</b> Focus of the thesis is on possibilities of further education {{for these people}} in the Czech Republic and identification of their participation in it. Theoretical knowledge of hearing impairment is used in the thesis. Emphasis is put on differences among deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people.</b> These differences are caused by diverse severity and type of hearing impairment and different communication systems used by deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people.</b> The thesis deals with the impact of differences mentioned above on further education opportunities for deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people.</b> Initial education of these people, their professional participation and connection of both to further education is concerned. Knowledge of further vocational education, hobby education and civic education is used in the thesis. Part of the thesis is dedicated to analysis of further education opportunities for deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people</b> provided by organizations which support them. The analysis focuses mainly on character of education opportunities. Quantitative empirical research is conducted to identify the participation of deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>people</b> in further educational activities and the main reasons for participating or nonparticipating in [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Still, it was {{not until}} 1970 that the Queen of Canada {{purchased}} the right to the lyrics and music of [...] "O Canada"—from Gordon V. Thompson Music for $1—and 1980 before the song finally became the official national anthem via the National Anthem Act. The act established a religious reference to the English lyrics and the phrase [...] "From far and wide, O Canada" [...] to replace one of the repetitions of the phrase [...] "We stand on guard." [...] This change was controversial with traditionalists and, for several years afterwards, {{it was not}} uncommon to <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> still singing the old lyrics at public events. In contrast, the French version has never been changed from its original.|$|E
500|$|Other issues {{included}} the studio's desire to substitute Montreal or Prague for Paris {{in order to}} lower costs, Liman's insistence {{on the use of}} a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, [...] "When I <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> saying that the production was a nightmare it's like, a 'nightmare'?

Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I {{had anything to do with}} it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E

After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music".

2500|$|Prior to Albert's marriage, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} of his continual bachelor status. Although he had received much press attention for dating well-known fashion models and actresses, his apparent disinclination to marry gave rise to rumours that he was homosexual.

2500|$|Traditionally, the {{particule}} de is omitted when {{citing the}} name of a person without a preceding given name, title (baron, duc etc.), job description (général, colonel, etc.) or polite address (monsieur, madame, mademoiselle). Thus, one would say Monsieur de La Vieuville, but if calling him familiarly by his last name only, La Vieuville (note the initial capital letter); the same applies for Gérard de La Martinière, who would be called La Martinière. Similarly, Philippe de Villiers talks about the votes he receives as le vote Villiers.

2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, and you can <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers and staring at them. She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case.
