50|$|Mary Elizabeth Garrett, {{who became}} the wealthiest “spinster woman” {{in the country with}} the death of her father John Work Garrett, was the benefactress of this {{experiment}} in education. She was often onsite during the construction of a unique school building in downtown Baltimore from 1888 to 1890, which cost her the immense sum of $400,000. It featured an indoor swimming pool complete with cold “needle baths”, a gymnasium with suspended track and outfitted with the most modern <b>gymnasium</b> <b>equipment</b> from Sweden and the Sargent School of Boston, as well as a full-time physician to oversee the athletic and posture programs. Up the many flights of stairs were complete scientific laboratories, an art room flooded with natural light by skylights, and a library stocked with classics and modern literature as well as scientific and mathematical volumes. The large study hall bore a complete copy of the Parthenon Frieze and there were copies of European and American statuary and artwork throughout the building for the girls to study and draw. The building was so intriguing that a model of it was made for the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago and numerous articles about it appeared in newspapers across the country. Women who had reached the highest levels of academic achievement wrote to the founders offering their support and enthusiasm, as well as recommendations for faculty from among their own students. The school was seen as a move forward for women's education reaching far beyond Baltimore and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1997 book {{of essays}} {{entitled}} The Geography of the Imagination, American writer Guy Davenport suggests a different inspiration for Kilmer's poem."Trees were favorite symbols for Yeats, Frost, {{and even the}} young Pound. ... But Kilmer had been reading about trees in another context, the movement to stop child labor and set up nursery schools in slums. ... Margaret McMillan ... had the happy idea that {{a breath of fresh}} air and an intimate acquaintance with grass and trees were worth all the pencils and desks in the whole school system. ... The English word for <b>gymnasium</b> <b>equipment</b> is 'apparatus.' And in her book Labour and Childhood (1907) you will find this sentence: 'Apparatus can be made by fools, but only God can make a tree.'It appears that Davenport must have loosely and erroneously paraphrased the sentiments expressed by McMillan, as this exact quote does not appear in her text. Instead, McMillan is expressing the observation that several nineteenth-century writers, including William Rankin, William Morris and Thomas Carlyle, opposed the effects of machinery on society and craftsmanship and thus eschewed machine-made items. Davenport's observation likely was derived in some way from McMillan's examination and quotation of Carlyle:"He (Carlyle) often makes comparisons between men and machines, and even trees and machines, greatly to the disadvantage of the latter. For example, 'O, that we could displace the machine god and put a man god in his place!' and 'I find no similitude of life so true as this of a tree! Beautiful! Machine of the universe!' ...|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} suggests that educational process, learning and students' performance depend {{on a number of}} factors such as personal and professional characteristics of teachers, curricula, and the quality of teaching and extra-curricular activities. In addition, the quality of educational process is closely connected to material-technical conditions of the school and the quality of teaching equipment. This mostly concerns school facilities (school buildings, classrooms, cabinets, library, other facilities, courtyard and <b>gymnasium),</b> <b>equipment,</b> furniture and teaching aids. However, quality learning and work also require favourable physical, physiological, social and psychological conditions for study. This is the reason why this paper investigates students' opinions concerning the influence of certain characteristics of school facilities (wall colours, visual aids hanging on walls, teaching aids, furniture), and other physical aspects, including the size of student's groups on the quality of study and learning, as well as whether these opinions vary according to sex, age and year of study. The data was collected by a questionnaire comprising 25 items especially designed for the needs of this investigation. There were 116 respondents, students of the Preschool Teacher Training College in Kruševac. The findings show that certain features of the space and certain physical characteristics do have impact on students' work and performance, and therefore on the quality of teaching. They also demonstrate that students' estimates and opinions vary according to age and year of study...|$|E

The name of the school was Dixie School and had been built as a WPA project during the 1940s and had served the immediate area for almost 40 years. The building was purchased from Tyler Independent School District after TISD built the new (and current) Dixie Elementary School, roughly three miles from the old location. YWAM took the school and worked to restore it. The school was renovated to keep the older educational look to it, while bringing in modern renovations. The old Dixie School football field was converted to a soccer pitch, and the gynamsium would have a chemistry lab installed inside and locker rooms and weight rooms were added in the second level of the <b>gymnasium.</b> New playground <b>equipment</b> was installed for elementary students and a cafe was built for students to eat lunch in.
