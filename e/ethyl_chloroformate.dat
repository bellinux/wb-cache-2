Nucleophilic substitution reactions involving a saturated carbon are well documented and understood. However, there has been disagreement concerning the mechanism for nucleophilic attack at carbonyl carbon. Two primary concerns of this work are to see whether the Grunwald-Winstein equation (developed for attack at saturated carbon) can be applied to attack at the unsaturated carbon of a carbonyl group and, if this is indeed the case, to apply them to the study of solvolyses of carbonyl halides, so as to obtain new types of mechanistic information. The substrates studied include various aroyl halides, <b>ethyl</b> and phenyl <b>chloroformates</b> (and derivatives with oxygen replaced by sulfur), diphenylcarbamoyl chloride and diphenylcarbamoyl pyridinium chloride. The sensitivities of the rates of solvolysis towards changes in solvent nucleophilicity and solvent ionizing power will be closely related to the amounts of bond making and bond breaking at the transition state, allowing important mechanistic conclusions to be drawn. Dependent upon the substituent, solvolysis of a para-substituted benzoyl chloride or fluoride can have either bond breaking or bond formation dominant, corresponding to mechanisms within the SN 1 - SN 2 spectrum or to addition-elimination, respectively. Initial-state conjugation leads to reduced reactivity for chloroformates and related esters. Phenyl chloroformate is proposed to solvolyse by an addition-elimination pathway but, replacement of oxygen by sulfur causes a shift towards the SN 2 mechanism, with an accompanying increase in acylium ion (SN 1) character when two sulfur atoms are introduced. Correlation analysis of the specific rates of solvolysis of diphenylcarbamoyl chloride suggests that an ionization pathway is followed, favored by a strong electron donation from the nitrogen. The specific rates of solvolysis of diphenylcarbamoyl pyridinium chloride are almost independent of solvent composition, indicating nucleophilicity to be unimportant and a rate determining step involving unimolecular carbon-chlorine heterolysis. Based on the successful correlations of the specific rates of solvolysis {{of a wide variety of}} carbonyl halides, it is concluded that application of the Grunwald-Winstein equations, especially the extended equation, can give valuable information concerning the detailed mechanism of solvolysis of the numerous substrates containing this structural unit...|$|R

5000|$|The first biologically {{occurring}} initial substance for tropane {{expansion into}} anatoxin-a was cocaine, which has similar stereochemistry to anatoxin-a. Cocaine is first converted into the endo isomer of cyclopropane, {{which is then}} photolytically cleaved to obtain an alpha, beta unsaturated ketone. Through the use of diethyl azodicarboxylate, the ketone is demethylated and anatoxin-a is formed. A similar, more recent synthesis pathway involves producing 2-tropinone from cocaine and treating the product with <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> producing a bicyclic ketone. This product is combined with trimethylsilyldiazylmethane, an organoaluminum Lewis acid and trimethylsinyl enol ether to produce tropinone. This method undergoes several more steps, producing useful intermediates as well as anatoxin-a as a final product.|$|E
50|$|Although {{available}} commercially, diethyl azodicarboxylate {{is often}} prepared fresh in the laboratory, especially if required in pure, non-diluted form. A two-step synthesis starts from hydrazine, first by alkylation with <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate,</b> followed by treating the resulting diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate with chlorine (bubbling through the solution), hypochlorous acid, concentrated nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid. The reaction {{is carried out}} in an ice bath, and the reagents are added dropwise so that the temperature does not rise above 20 °C. Diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate is a solid with melting temperature of 131-133 °C which is collected as a residue; it is significantly more stable to heating than DEAD and is conventionally dried at a temperature of about 80 °C.|$|E
50|$|Dane salt {{formation}} between 3,5-dimethoxyaniline and ethyl acetoacetate followed by borohydrate reduction gives synthon 1.

Deblocking with HBr is followed by etherification of the nonchelated phenolic hydroxyl gives 3. Treatment with NaH and ethyl formate results in both N-formylation and C-formylation of the active methylene to give 4. Michael addition of methyl vinyl ketone (MVP) followed by successive base treatments to remove the activating C-formyl group and then to complete the Robinson annulation to give 5. Lithium in liquid ammonia reduces the olefinic linkage and successive acetylation and sodium borohydrate reductions complete the synthesis of nantradol (6).|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small chemical difference between ampicillin and benzylpenicillin not only allows for substantial oral activity but also {{results in a}} substantial broadening of antimicrobial spectrum so as to allow for use against many Gram-negative bacteria. Many devices have been employed {{in order to enhance}} still further the oral absorption of ampicillin. Bacampicillin is a prodrug of ampicillin designed for this purpose.An azidopenicillin sodium salt (1) is reacted with mixed carbonate ester 2 (itself prepared from acetaldehyde and <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate)</b> to give ester 3. Reduction of the azido linkage with hydrogen and a suitable catalyst produces bacampillin (4). Both enantiomers are active. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is quickly cleaved by serum esterases to bioactive ampicillin, acetaldehyde, CO2 and ethanol.|$|E
50|$|Alkylation of nicotinonitrile (accessible from nicotinamide)) (1) with {{methyl iodide}} affords the N-methylpyridinium salt (2). Treatment of this {{intermediate}} with sodium borohydride reduces it to 3-cyano-N-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (3) {{in which the}} position of the double bond mimics that in arecoline. Reaction of (3) with <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> results in N-demethylation and consequent formation of the corresponding carbamate. The nitrile group is then transformed to a tetrazole by reaction with sodium azide in the presence of aluminum chloride, one of the standard procedures for building that ring. The surrogate acid is then alkylated with ethyl iodide to afford (6). Treatment with acid then removes the carbamate on the ring nitrogen (7) and the methyl group on the piperidine ring restored using formaldehyde and formic acid under standard Eschweiler-Clarke conditions, yielding the muscarinic agonist alvameline (8).|$|E
50|$|Starting {{material}} for this preparation is ketoester 1, available {{by one of the}} classical benzomorphan syntheses. Condensation with the ylide from Triethyl phosphonoacetate (HWE reaction) affords diester 2. Catalytic hydrogenation proceeds from the less hindered face to afford the corresponding saturated diester (3). The esters are then reduced by means of LiAlH4 to give the glycol (4); this undergoes internal ether formation on treatment with acid to form the pyran ring of 5. Von Braun reaction with BrCN (or <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate)</b> followed by saponification of the intermediate leads to the 2° amine (6). This is converted to the cyclopropylmethyl derivative 8 by acylation with cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride followed by reduction of the thus formed amide (7) with LiAlH4. Cleave of the O-methyl ether with sodium Ethanethiol affords proxorphan (9).|$|E
50|$|Dietary {{cholesterol}} needs be esterified {{in order}} to be absorbed from the gut. The enzyme, cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP), then completes the absorption of cholesterol. Drugs that interfere with the action of these peptides would aid in lowering cholesterol levels by complementing the action of the statins that inhibit the endogenous production of cholesterol. The CETP inhibitor torcetrapib (8) proved very effective in lowering cholesterol levels in humans; the drug not only lowered low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) but also raised levels of high density, “good” lipoproteins (HDL). This agent, which had only a brief time on the market due to adverse safety reports, is included here to illustrate an unusual method for preparing tetrahydroquinolines.Reaction of the trifluoromethylaniline (1) with propanal in the presence of benzotriazole (2) affords the aminal (3). Condensation of (3) with the vinyl carbamate (4) yields the tetrahydroquinoline ring (5) with expulsion of the benzotriazole fragment. The ring nitrogen is then protected as its ethyl carbamate by acylation with <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> (6). The benzyl carbamate function on nitrogen at the 4 position is next removed by reduction with ammonium formate over palladium to afford the primary amine; this compound is then resolved as its dibenzyl tartrate salt to afford the 2R,4S isomer (7). Reductive amination with the bis-trifuoromethyl benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride followed by acylation with methyl chloroformate completes the synthesis of torcetrapib (8).|$|E
