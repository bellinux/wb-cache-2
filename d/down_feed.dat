Grinding RBSiC is removed mainly by brittle fracture and lightly by ductile cutting. With {{the increase of}} <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> surface roughness Ra increases. Burnishing with no <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> can improve the Ra in some way. With increasing <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> the compressive {{residual stress}} decreases because of an inadequately cooling effect. Compare with the specimens grounded using 0. 9 μm/s, those using <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> of 1. 35 μm/s have worse surface quality.

The effect of nozzle-to-throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio “X”, on the jet pump performance was also tested, with different flow rates and motive pressures, in both cases (up feed and <b>down</b> <b>feed).</b> It was found that the best efficiency for the jet pump is attained with the up feeding configuration.

40|$|Wire saw {{process is}} widely used to slice many ceramic {{crystals}} that are utilized {{in a wide range}} of engineering applications ranging from silicon wafers in microelectronics and photovoltaic industries to piezo-crystals for actuators and sonar detectors. The process has a higher yield, lower kerf loss and lower surface damage with respect to inner diameter saw. The wire saw process allows higher diameter and thinner wafer cutting. The process is also used in cutting almost all brittle materials including; ultra-hard carbides, high density or foam ceramics, glasses, sapphire and rocks. Wire saw process represents 30 % of the total silicon wafer production cost which directly affects the industry. There is a need to optimize the process by developing models relating process parameters to the out puts.;In this work, we have conducted parametric experimental study on a model wire saw to correlate the process parameters to quality of the machined surface. An automated single wire machine that can allow the variation of the <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> speed, wire speed and wire tension is utilized. Detailed analysis of the cut surface topology is carried out using surface profilomtry and SEM imaging. The detailed parametric study is rationalized in several models that describe the relation between the process parameters and the process induced surface damage.

40|$|For ruminants, the {{microbial}} population existing in the rumen breaks <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> ingredients {{offered to the}} animal. This population must be healthy and viable to permit maximum utilization of feed ingredients. Because ruminants evolved mainly as forage feeders, factors that disrupt population of cellulolytic microorganisms will result in reduced utilization of nutrients [...] primarily, energy and protein, but also reduced production of vitamins and utilization of minerals. Factors that affect nutritional value of feedstuffs are discussed below. Nutritional variation. Let us assume that a diet is formulated solely on the average composition of a feedstuff that contains an average CP value of 21. 5 % with a coefficient of variation of 24 %. During a year, several batches of this feedstuff were purchased to formulate a ration throughout that year. Crude protein content derived from that feedstuff would vary as much as 24 %. Thus, if the ration contained 50 % of that feedstuff, CP content of the total diet would vary as much as 12 %. This is equivalent to offering CP levels between 10. 6 and 13. 4 % during this period. Variation in batches of alternative feedstuffs is dependent mainly on the process that it used to produce that feedstuff. Although some of this variation may be reduced by purchasing from the same source, changes in processing do occur due to changes in demand of main process end products. Thus, as fo...|$|E

40|$|Special Small Scale Devices Q 2 ̆ 6 A video: [URL] Biochar-producing Cookstoves: TLUDs and the GACC - Paul S Anderson, PhD [URL] This and {{the other}} presentations in this session will give the {{attendees}} specific (as well as introductory) information about how you as individuals or small groups can ACTUALLY PRODUCE YOUR OWN BIOCHAR. This can be of particular interest to: 1. Teachers / educators of any subject that relates to biochar (physical sciences, plant science, soil science, social science, etc.) 2. Experimenters interested in biochar characterization, including issues of different original biomass {{and the making of}} “designer biochars” by changing production characteristics. 3. Gardeners who also have access to sufficient dry biomass. 4. Anyone supportive of improved cookstoves for impoverished people, including supporters of NGOs working overseas. Production of biochar in small amounts is commonly associated with cooking stoves called TLUD (tee-lud = Top-Lit UpDraft) gasifiers. TLUD pyrolysis is explained and presented in the context of GACC world-wide efforts to introduce 100 million improved cookstoves into impoverished households. Availability of such stoves in North America is discussed, including Do-It-Yourself options, {{the pros and cons of}} such devices, and the potential for introduction of biochar studies into school curricula. This presentation is a good introduction for some activities at the Biochar Tech Field Day on Thursday after the conference. Conversion of Biomass to Biochar in larger custom-built kiln devices - Paul Taylor, PhD. Mt. Warning, NSW, AU [URL] Small property holders, small farmers and community gardeners seek small-scale biochar production devices that process their waste biomass into biochars or enhanced biochars suitable for their soils. They seek to accomplish this with modest budgets in the 100 ’s to 30, 000 range. In this talk we discuss the principals, fuel supply and quality, energy balance, heating methods, emissions levels and regulatory and safety issues relevant to small-scale kiln design. We exemplify with experience in Australia developing batch reactors ranging in size from recycled 55 gal (200 L) drums, through small in-field pyrolyzers, up to 1 and 2 cubic meter cart kilns, and shipping container sized. We also refer to small continuous feed pyrolyzers developed in farm based enterprises in Australia. We include the use of advanced computational fluid dynamics and combustion models to help optimize the designs. Emphasis has been placed on developing integrated systems that allow farmers to use biochar at low application rates. Two systems will be highlighted: one provides process heat for animal pens, and combines the biochar with compost into a granulated pellet; the other produces a synthetic terra preta granule that can be fully organic or a mixture of chemical, minerals and biochar. Jolly Roger Ovens - Biochar making devices for gardeners and small farmers in North America: Karl Frogner 2 ̆ 6 Doug Clayton [URL] “Jolly Roger Ovens” (J-RO’s), inspired John Rogers’ work with 200 liter TLUD’s, are a family of biochar making devices capable of producing 1 to 3 cu-ft per hour of high adsorbing biochar from thinly distributed but widely available feedstocks. Constructed from steel drums and commonly available components, they are easy to build and with minimal practice can perform in a clean, smoke free, manner. While large TLUD’s are often thought to be the province of the developing world (e. g. the work of RE:Char), they also may fill the unmet demand for biochar in the forward thinking, early adopter, communities of organic growers, community organizations, permaculture enthusiasts, etc. The presentation will cover simple, natural draft, J-RO designs based on 200 liter carbon steel drums, retort and forced draft augmentations, as well as potentials for improvements and scaling up or <b>down.</b> <b>Feed</b> stock options and strategies for gathering, handling and pre-treating them will also be discussed. Suggestions for community projects for producing biochar for local use with J-RO’s will be covered. There will be a brief mention of post production treatments trialed by the authors...|$|E
