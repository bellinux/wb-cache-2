40|$|We {{show that}} {{inflation}} risk is priced in international asset returns. We analyze inflation risk in {{a framework that}} encompasses the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Adler and Dumas (1983). In contrast to the extant empirical literature on the ICAPM, we relax the assumption that inflation rates are constant. We estimate and test a conditional version of {{the model for the}} G 5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the U. K., and the U. S.) over the period 1975 - 1998 and find evidence of statistically and <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>prices</b> of inflation risk (in addition to priced nominal exchange rate risk). Our results imply a rejection of the restrictions imposed by the ICAPM. In an extension of our analysis to 2003, we show that even after the termination of nominal exchange rate fluctuations in the euro area in 1999, differences in inflation rates across countries entail non-trivial real exchange rate risk premia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{scarcity}} effects of quantitative easing (QE) policies, drawing on intra-day transaction-level data for German government bonds, purchased under the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) of the ECB/Eurosystem. This paper {{is the first}} to match high-frequency QE purchase data with high-frequency inter-dealer data. We find <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>price</b> impacts at high (minute-by-minute) and low (daily) frequencies, highlighting the relevance of scarcity effects in bond markets. Asset purchase policies are not without side effects, though, as the induced scarcity has an adverse impact on liquidity conditions as measured by bid-ask spreads and inter-dealer order book depth. We further show that the price impact varies greatly with market conditions: it is considerably higher during episodes of illiquidity and when yields are higher...|$|R
40|$|On an {{international}} post World War II dataset, we use an iterated GMM procedure to estimate {{and test the}} Campbell and Cochrane (1999, By force of habit: a consumption-based explanation of aggregate stock market behavior. Journal of Political Economy 107, 205 - 251.) habit formation model with a time-varying risk-free rate. In addition, we analyze the predictive power of the surplus consumption ratio for future stock and bond returns. We find that, although there are important cross-country differences and <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>pricing</b> errors, {{for the majority of}} countries in our sample the model gets empirical support in a variety of different dimensions, including reasonable estimates of risk-free rates. Further, for the majority of countries the surplus consumption ratio captures time-variation in expected returns. Together with the price-dividend ratio, the surplus consumption ratio contains significant information about future stock returns, also during the 1990 s. In addition, in most countries the surplus consumption ratio is also a powerful predictor of future bond returns. Thus, the surplus consumption ratio captures time-varying expected returns in both stock and bond markets.

40|$|Gated {{community}} in Malaysia {{is an increasing}} trend of residential property markets. The notion that gated communities may increase the property value because they have higher demand in the market. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the impact of gated {{community in}} relation to value added and the overall residential property market in Johor Bahru. A total of 565 sample sale transactions in four housing schemes (Taman Bukit Indah, Taman Mount Austin, Taman Pulai Utama and Taman Nusa Bestari) in Johor Bahru were used for model estimation. Hedonic price model approach is used to study the effects of gated and non-gated amenities and also examine households willingness to pay higher pricing for properties over the year 2005 - 2009. Houses in the gated community command an <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>price</b> premium where other factors held constant. The study area is divided into Nusajaya center and Nusajaya fringe in Johor Bahru. The results shown that the gated housing in Nusajaya area was greater in maintenance the property value than gated housing in urban fringe accordingly sales transaction from the period year of 2005 to 2009. The research has indicated consumer will pay a premium for property that meets their lifestyle or security requirements in gated community of developer residential property...|$|R

We find that Chapter 11 airlines experience both statistically and <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> adverse <b>price</b> changes at the time of filing for bankruptcy. During the close-to- 3 years after filing, however, these airlines experience significantly positive price changes. Their rivals experience significantly positive price reactions both {{at the time of the}} filing and up to 3 years post-filing. The evidence is consistent with substantial improvement in the financial condition of the bankrupt airlines after the reorganization, and with rivals gaining from the failures of other airlines.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the unobservable "short" or "instantaneous" rate of interest are frequently estimated using a proxy variable. We show the biases resulting from this practice (the "proxy" problem) {{are related to the}} derivatives of the proxy with respect to the short rate and the (inverse) function from the proxy to the short rate. Analytic results show that the proxy problem is not <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> for single- factor affine models, for parameter values consistent with US data. In addition, for the two-factor affine model of Longstaff and Schwartz (1992), the proxy problem is only <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> for <b>pricing</b> discount bonds with maturities of more than 5 years. We also describe two different procedures which can be used to assess the magnitude of the proxy problem in more general interest rate models. Numerical evaluation of a nonlinear single-factor model suggests that the proxy problem can significantly affect both estimates of the diffusion function and discount bond prices. interest rates, proxies, term structure...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{transient}} institutional investors (i. e., institutions that trade actively to maximize short-term profits) have information {{that allows them}} to predict a break in a string of consecutive quarterly earnings increases and thereby avoid the <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> negative stock <b>price</b> response associated with the break announcement. We show that transient institutions predict the break at least one quarter in advance of the break quarter. We also provide evidence that is consistent with transient institutions obtaining information regarding the impending break from private communications with management.

40|$|Using a GARCH model, we {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of U. S. monetary policy action and communication on the price volatility of commodities for the period 1998 – 2009. We find, first, that U. S. monetary policy events have an <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> impact on <b>price</b> volatility. Second, expected target rate changes and communications decrease volatility, whereas target rate surprises and unorthodox monetary policy measures increase it. Third, we find a change in reaction to central bank communication during the recent financial crisis: the “calming” effect of communication found for the whole sample is partly offset during that period.

40|$|This paper econometrically {{examines}} the factors determining {{the real estate}} price dynamics in Chile in the period 1990 - 2007. For such purpose, we use annual data of 419 homes located in the Metropolitan Area and acquired in that period. The results indicate that variables such as age and size are statistically significant determinants {{in the formation of}} property prices; access to the subway stations tends to capitalize in a non-linear manner; and both household income and aggregate income are statistically and <b>economically</b> <b>significant.</b> The <b>price</b> decomposition reveals that between 69 % and 71 % of the housing price level is explained by determinants related to attributes of the property, while about 70 % of the observed growth in housing prices between 1990 and 2007 is the result of macro-financial determinants. During 2006 and 2007, the trend in prices is not significantly different from that predicted by the model. These results tend to be similar using alternative estimates by housing type and different sample sub-periods. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{further evidence}} on the holiday effect by analyzing stock market behavior during on the days a public holiday isn’t accompanied by a stock market break. Indeed, beginning in 2003, when the trading calendar of Portuguese stock market was harmonized with the remaining Euronext national markets, on several occasions Portuguese national holidays were not weekdays on which the stock market was closed. Moreover, we adopt a bottom up approach {{that allows us to}} further investigate the holiday effect at the industry level. Our results show a statistically significant liquidity effect and an <b>economically</b> and statistically <b>significant</b> <b>price</b> effect. On average, relative volume decreases 32 %, close to close returns are 31 % higher and volatility is 37 % lower during Portuguese specific national holidays then during a typical trading day. These results suggest the prevalence of a mood effect, by which those non-distracted traders’ positive feelings translate into a selling pressure that drives up prices during country-specific holidays...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} hybrid {{approach}} for estimating beta that shrinks rolling window estimates toward firm-specific priors motivated by economic theory. Our method yields superior forecasts of beta that have important practical implications. First, unlike standard rolling window betas, hybrid betas carry a <b>significant</b> <b>price</b> of {{risk in the}} cross-section even after controlling for characteristics. Second, the hybrid approach offers statistically and <b>economically</b> <b>significant</b> out-of-sample benefits for investors who use factor models to construct optimal portfolios. We show that the hybrid estimator outperforms existing estimators because shrinkage toward a fundamentals-based prior is effective in reducing measurement noise in extreme beta estimates...|$|R
