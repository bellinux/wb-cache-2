50|$|In 685, John Maron, who {{recognized}} {{the legitimacy of}} Paul the Jew and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> until Byzantium began to appoint titular Patriarchs of Antioch ending with Theophanes (681-687), was elected Patriarch of Antioch by the Maradite army. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian II sent an army to dislodge John from the see; John and his followers retreated to Lebanon, where they formed the Maronite Church, whose succession of Patriarchs have continued to the present day. The Byzantines appointed Theophanes of Antioch in his stead. Thus there were now three rival patriarchs: those that recognized Severus and <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> those that recognized John Maron and <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> and those that recognized Theophanes and <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> It was the successors of Theophanes who were recognized as legitimate by the Byzantine government.|$|R

5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b> Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as <b>his</b> <b>successor,</b> so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E
