25|$|On 13 January 2009, {{the authorship}} of Entropa came into question. Officially, the artwork {{was to have}} been an {{international}} collaboration between David Černý and artists from the other 26 EU countries.

25|$|On 22 August 1872, Milan was {{declared}} of age, {{and he took}} government into his own hands. He soon demonstrated great intellectual capacity, coupled with a passionate headstrong character. Eugene Schuyler, who observed <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time, {{found him to be}} a very remarkable, singularly intelligent and well-informed young man. The Principality of Serbia was still a de jure part of the Ottoman Empire though in reality it already had long functioned as a semi-independent state whose politics and economy was much more dependent on other Great Powers, particularly Austria-Hungary and Russian Empire, than on its formal ruler, the declining Ottomans. Milan carefully manoeuvred between the Austrian and Russian geopolitical interests in Serbia, with a judicious leaning towards the former.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Trần Thủ Độ was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Trần Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort.

Once there {{was a person who}} went to the Emperor to report <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> suspicion, Thái Tông immediately visited Trần Thủ Độ's place with this man and made him tell everything in front of the grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Trần Thủ Độ not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Trần Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Trần period but also contributed to the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E

Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old. Shatner asked Nimoy if {{he would be willing to}} discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed. Nimoy later said that no one had ever asked <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> part of his past, and that discussing it in Mind Meld [...] "was an opportunity to put out some information that might be helpful to some people." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory.

After the lunch Jim admits, with some prodding, that he is angry that Pam did not tell <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> incident. Pam explains that she had not wanted to add to his worries, which only makes Jim angrier, but he brushes the matter off to avoid an argument. The couple had planned on sharing an evening bottle of wine for Valentine's Day, but Jim later tells Pam he wants to go down to Philadelphia instead because he fears they would only end up fighting. Pam initially accepts this, but realizing that the silence between them is worse than fighting, she tells Jim he should stay and fight with her, and Jim agrees.|$|E

Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after he shook his hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs.|$|E
