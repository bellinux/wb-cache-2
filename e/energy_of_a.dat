In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to drain the <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time runs out.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of the kilogram is undergoing a fundamental change—the current definition defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photon via the Planck constant.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the small}} kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> UCN, the {{influence}} of gravitation is significant. Thus, the trajectories are parabolic. Kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> UCN is transformed into potential (height) energy with ~102 neV/m.|$|R
50|$|Common types <b>of</b> {{potential}} <b>energy</b> {{include the}} gravitational potential <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object {{that depends on}} its mass and its distance {{from the center of}} mass of another object, the elastic potential <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended spring, and the electric potential <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric charge in an electric field.

25|$|Like any {{physical}} quantity that is <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> velocity, the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object {{depends on the}} relationship between the object and the observer's frame of reference.

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, {{and the amount of}} energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid {{has to do}} with the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

Following immediately {{on from the}} conclusion of StarCraft, Zeratul and a ranking templar Artanis evacuate the surviving Khalai Protoss from Aiur to the Dark Templar world of Shakuras. After the Zerg follow them to Shakuras, Zeratul and Artanis harness the <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resident Xel'Naga temple, scouring the planet of all the Zerg. The Protoss attempt to rebuild their lives on Shakuras, but are interrupted by a Zerg raid commanded by Sarah Kerrigan that kidnaps the dark templar leader Raszagal. Using Raszagal as leverage, Kerrigan coerces Zeratul into killing a new Overmind in incubation. Zeratul complies, but later kills Raszagal after it is revealed she has been brainwashed by the Zerg. Zeratul disappears while Artanis takes leadership and tries to reconstruct his people's civilization.|$|E

5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E
