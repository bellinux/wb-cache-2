Besides, {{if and only if}} an odd prime p <b>divides</b> an (and 2p does not <b>divide</b> n), then p also <b>divides</b> an + k(p - 1) (if 2p <b>divides</b> n, then the sentence should be changed to [...] "p also <b>divides</b> an + 2kp". In fact, if 2p <b>divides</b> n and p(p - 1) does not <b>divide</b> n, then p <b>divides</b> an.) for every integer k (a condition is n + k(p - 1) must be > 1). For example, since 19 <b>divides</b> a11 and 2 × 19 = 38 does not <b>divide</b> 11, so 19 <b>divides</b> a18k + 11 for all k.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} notion of weak <b>dividing</b> {{introduced}} by S. Shelah. In particular we prove that T is stable iff weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric. In order to study simple theories Shelah originally defined weak <b>dividing</b> in [6]. This notion is overshadowed by that of <b>dividing,</b> as the first author proved that <b>dividing</b> is the right well-behaved notion for simple theories [2],[3],[5],and [4]. However Dolich’s paper[1] reminded us that weak <b>dividing</b> is still an interesting notion. There he noted that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric and transitive in stable theories, and that simplicity {{is characterized by the}} property that <b>dividing</b> implies weak <b>dividing.</b> Here we continue the investigation of {{the notion of}} weak <b>dividing.</b> Intriguingly, what weak <b>dividing</b> is to stability is analogous with what <b>dividing</b> is to simplicity. For example, we show that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric only in stable theories (2. 5). Stability is also equivalent to left local character of weak <b>dividing.</b> However for the transitivity of weak <b>dividing,</b> a similar analogy does not exist. Namely, in a non-stable simple theory (e. g. the theory of the random graph), weak <b>dividing</b> can be transitive (2. 7). As usual, we work in a saturated model of an arbitrary complete theory T.

40|$|The {{issue of}} digital <b>divide</b> has {{attracted}} many researchers {{for over a}} decade, yet the understanding of digital <b>divide</b> is not comprehensive. This research examines three commonly recognised orders of the digital <b>divide,</b> which are: economic <b>divide,</b> the inequality of access to ICT associated with economic conditions; access <b>divide,</b> the disparity of access to ICT; and capability <b>divide,</b> the inequality of ability in using ICT, while conceptualising a fourth <b>divide,</b> innovativeness <b>divide,</b> which {{is defined as the}} disparity of individual’s willingness to try out any new information technology. The paper presents a tentative model based on extensive literature review which was explored using qualitative method. The findings generate new insights into the relationships among those four orders of digital <b>divide</b> which contribute to the theoretical framework to understand the digital <b>divide</b> more comprehensively and provide evidence on the impact of digital <b>divide</b> on e-government use. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed in this paper. <br /...|$|R

5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into a <b>divided</b> highway, which at the time was the best {{superhighway}} and the longest stretch of <b>divided</b> highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were constructed while others were widened into <b>divided</b> highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major project completed during that time was the construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to <b>divided</b> highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into a <b>divided</b> highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing a <b>divided</b> highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E

The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the <b>divided</b> highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a <b>divided</b> highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar <b>divided</b> highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a <b>divided</b> highway.|$|E

Also, MD 2 was shifted to a new alignment between Sunderland and Owings, with the former route becoming MD 765. MD 2/MD 4 was widened to a <b>divided</b> highway between Huntingtown and the split in Sunderland in 1967. The <b>divided</b> highway was extended to south of Huntingtown in 1969, bypassing Huntingtown to the east. The former alignment through the community became MD 524. In 1970, MD 2/MD 4 became a <b>divided</b> highway between Prince Frederick and south of Huntingtown. In January 1978, MD 4 was rerouted north of Solomons onto the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River. In 1979, the <b>divided</b> highway was extended south from Prince Frederick to Port Republic. MD 2/MD 4 was shifted west to a new <b>divided</b> highway between south of St. Leonard to Port Republic in 1981, with the former two-lane routing designated part of MD 765. In 1987, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and south of St. Leonard was shifted to a new <b>divided</b> highway. The bypassed alignment through Lusby and Solomons became another part of MD 765.|$|E

MD 704's modern cloverleaf interchange with MD 202 {{was completed in}} 1971, the same year the former highway {{was expanded}} to a <b>divided</b> highway from Seat Pleasant to {{just north of the}} latter highway. The <b>divided</b> highway was extended southwest through Glenarden from Ardwick Ardmore Road to Glenarden Parkway in 1972 and to MD 202 in 1973. MD 704 was renamed for Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1987. The highway's interchange with US 50 was rebuilt in 1991 in conjunction with the overhaul of the US 50Capital Beltway interchange immediately to the west; two of the interchange's loop ramps with westbound MD 704 were removed. The MD 704 <b>divided</b> highway was extended east from the US 50 interchange to Forbes Boulevard in 1997 and Lottsford Vista Road in 1999. MD 704 and MD 450 were relocated at their junction to make MD 704 part of the eastwest axis of a more orthogonal intersection in 2000.
