5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The <b>ground</b> <b>leaves</b> of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into the ears of camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio.|$|E
6000|$|... (V.) Giulietta Austriaca. Pink, {{and very}} lovely, with bold cluster of <b>ground</b> <b>leaves,</b> but itself minute--almost dwarf. Called 'small bitter milkwort' by S. How far {{distinct}} from the next following one, Norwegian, is not told.|$|E
6000|$|... (IV.) Giulietta Cisterciana. Its present name, 'Calcarea,' is meant, in botanic Latin, {{to express}} its growth on {{limestone}} or chalk mountains. But {{we might as}} well call the South Down sheep, Calcareous mutton. My epithet will rightly associate it with the Burgundian hills round Cluny and Citeaux. Its <b>ground</b> <b>leaves</b> are much larger than those of the Depressa; the flower a little larger, but very pale.|$|E

6000|$|... 20. All this time, however, we {{have got}} no name for the prettiest of all stems,--that of annual flowers growing high from among their <b>ground</b> <b>leaves,</b> like lilies of the valley, and saxifrages, and the tall primulas--of which this pretty type, Fig. 15, was cut for me by Mr. Burgess years ago; admirable in its light outline of the foamy globe of flowers, {{supported}} and balanced in the meadow breezes on that elastic rod of slenderest life.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. What I {{have called}} 'stars' are {{irregular}} clusters of approximately, or tentatively, five aloeine <b>ground</b> <b>leaves,</b> of very pale green,--they may be six or seven, or more, but always {{run into a}} rudely pentagonal arrangement, essentially first trine, with two succeeding above. Taken as a whole the plant is really a main link between violets and Droseras; but the flower has much more violet than Drosera in the make of it,--spurred, and five-petaled,[11] and held down by {{the top of its}} bending stalk as a violet is; only its upper two petals are not reverted--the calyx, of a dark soppy green, holding them down, with its three front sepals set exactly like a strong trident, its two backward sepals clasping the spur. There are often six sepals, four to the front, but the normal number is five. Tearing away the calyx, I find the flower to have been held by it as a lion might hold his prey by the loins if he missed its throat; the blue petals being really campanulate, and the flower best described as a dark bluebell, seized and crushed almost flat by its own calyx in a rage. Pulling away now also the upper petals, I find that what are in the violet the lateral and well-ordered fringes, are here thrown mainly on the lower (largest) petal near its origin, and opposite the point of the seizure by the calyx, spreading from this centre over the surface of the lower petals, partly like an irregular shower of fine Venetian glass broken, partly like the wild-flung Medusa like embroidery of the white Lucia.[12] ...|$|E
