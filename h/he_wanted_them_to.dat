5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered in the caves by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally {{been linked to the}} legendary witch. The remains {{have been part of the}} collection of the Wells and Mendip Museum, which was founded by Balch, since they were excavated, though in 2004 the owner of the Caves said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be returned to Wookey Hole.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
25|$|This {{rebellion}} became entangled {{with the}} Kumul rebellion, when a Chinese Muslim and Uyghur army under Ma Zhancang and Timur Beg marched on Kashgar against the Chinese Muslim Daotai Ma Shaowu and his garrison of Han Chinese troops. Ma Shaowu began to panic and started raising Kirghiz levies under Osman Ali {{to defend the}} city. The Kirghiz were not amused at how their rebellion was crushed the previous year by Ma Shaowu, and now <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defend the city. They defected en masse to the enemy. However, Ma Zhancang also entered into secret negotiations with Ma Shaowu; he and his troops soon defected to the Han Chinese garrison in the city.|$|E

25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, that he did {{not think}} he was a good actor, but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|The Singsaker trams {{would operate}} {{into the city}} center. The chief of operations, Fredrik Kleven, {{suggested}} that they should operate to Trondheim Central Station. Ideally <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> operate to Voldsminde, {{but he did not}} want to mix trams with and without conductors on the Lade Line. Director Jon Garstad instead wanted the trams to terminate at Torvet, thus saving NOK20,000 annually in operating costs. The board suggested that the trams run in a loop down Prinsens gate, and along Dronningens gate to Munkegata where they would connect to the existing track. This would costNOK 52,000 to build. Alternatively, a new stop could be built at Church of Our Lady, costing an additional NOK30,000. No-one on the board voted for the railway station alternative.|$|E
25|$|Another line of {{research}} at Liverpool was measuring the fission cross section of uranium-235, on which Frisch and Peierls' calculations depended. They had assumed that almost every collision between a neutron of any energy and a uranium-235 nucleus would produce a fission. The value they used for the cross section was that published by French researchers in 1939. But was it correct? Data published by the Americans in the 15 March and 15 April 1940 issues of Physical Review indicated that the fission cross section was much smaller. No pure uranium-235 was available, so experiments at Liverpool were conducted with natural uranium. The results were inconclusive, but tended to support Frisch and Peierls. By March 1941, the Alfred Nier had managed to produce a microscopic amount of uranium-235 in the United States, and a team under Merle Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington was measuring the cross section. The uranium-235 was too valuable to send a sample to Britain, so Chadwick sent the Americans a list of measurements <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> carry out. The final result was that the cross section was larger than Frisch and Peierls had assumed, but the resulting critical mass was still only about 8 kilograms.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{drafted a}} {{screenplay}} in 1961, and envisaged making a [...] "grandiose" [...] epic, {{with up to}} 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He had intended hiring {{the armed forces of}} an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be [...] "so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets", with an [...] "aesthetic brilliance that doesn't require a military mind to appreciate". <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be replicated as authentically as possible on screen. Kubrick had sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and commissioned screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin, one of his young assistants on 2001, to the Isle of Elba, Austerlitz, and Waterloo, taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal. Kubrick approached numerous stars to play leading roles, including Audrey Hepburn for Empress Josephine, a part which she could not accept due to semiretirement.|$|E
500|$|... "Jugband Blues" [...] {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as [...] "Vegetable Man". Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] it is {{directed}} towards those around him. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. He told them <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> simply [...] "play whatever they want" [...] regardless {{of the rest of the}} group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used. About The Salvation Army, band manager Andrew King said that Barrett [...] "wanted a massive Salvation Army freak-out, but that's the only time I can remember Norman [...] putting his foot down." [...] The song features a distinctive three-tiered structure: starting off in 3/4 meter, then into 2/4 and finishing off in 4/4.|$|E
500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> think about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E

500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Graham was {{originally}} {{to write a}} single episode for the previous series, but withdrew {{because he did not}} have enough time to write the script. He then received an e-mail from showrunner Steven Moffat, who asked him to write for the next series; Graham agreed. When the two met, Moffat said he would like the episodes to lead into the mid-series finale and that it should deal with [...] "avatars that rebel". Initially worried this may seem too similar to the film Avatar, Graham went on to create the Flesh. Graham wanted the Gangers to be scary, but not monsters who wanted [...] "to take over the world for the sake of it". <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> appear relatable to the audience as they were humans who deserved rights. Moffat suggested that the avatars work in a factory; attempting to make it different from other factories featured in Doctor Who, Graham proposed to set the story in a monastery, an idea of which Moffat greatly approved. The monastery was inspired by the film The Name of the Rose, while the Gangers were influenced by The Thing; Graham described it as [...] "The Thing in the context of The Name of the Rose".|$|E
500|$|While on tour as Mos Def's in-concert DJ, Preservation {{began to}} remix some of The Ecstatics songs for their live routine. He {{challenged}} himself to remix {{the rest of}} the record, taking more than a year, as a project called The REcstatic, working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's mixing engineer. Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be sample-based and consistent in key, pitch, and tone to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. [...] "It's the result of countless hours of digging through records to sample", he recalled. [...] "Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on". The REcstatic was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's imprint label, Mon Dieu Music. Reviewing the remix album in Tiny Mix Tapes, Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a [...] "slightly rougher texture" [...] on what he deemed [...] "a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that can be said for very few modern rap 'remixes'".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by lead writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat. He designed the two-part episode as a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he had written for the third series. He compared the relationship to the film Alien and its sequel Aliens, with the former being more low-key and the latter more [...] "highly coloured". Moffat thought that Aliens was [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever" [...] and decided {{to use it as}} a model. He also intended to portray the Angels and their actions differently; in [...] "Blink" [...] they were barely surviving and resembled scavengers, while in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have a plan that could become [...] "almost like a war". The two-part story was intended to show the worst possible instance that could occur with the Weeping Angels, which was the inability to see, as explored in the second part, [...] "Flesh and Stone", when Amy must keep her eyes closed. Executive producer Piers Wenger thought that the Delirium Archive, the museum the Doctor and Amy visited at the beginning of the episode, needed to be explained, therefore Moffat named it [...] "the final resting place of the Headless Monks" [...] and sent it to him via text message. The Headless Monks themselves appeared in the mid-series finale of the next series, [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just to have something to think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{placed the}} 90 men {{of his company}} in {{position}} facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank {{at the edge of}} a woods. Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take position at the edge of the woods facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the edge of the woods. They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the edge of the woods and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position. This group was a security force for the mortars and they dropped to the ground about one-third of the way down the ridge.|$|E
