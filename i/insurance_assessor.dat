50|$|Within {{four days}} of the accident, {{the owners of the}} Nella Dan, the Danish Lauritzen company, had {{chartered}} an oil rig tender, the Lady Lorraine, which left Victoria carrying company representatives as well as <b>insurance</b> <b>assessors,</b> a team of divers and salvage experts. To protect the ship from further damage while awaiting possible salvage, the vessel deliberately took on sea water as ballast. This was intended to add sufficient weight to the hull to hold it in position on the rocks and prevent further damage or movement back out to sea. Although having a list of about 11 degrees, the ship was kept in a stable position and was also secured with cables to the shore. When the storm abated all remaining expedition equipment was removed from the ship.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Governments and {{companies}} are continually {{faced with a}} challenge to effectively manage all risks so as to protect their assets, financial health, property, reputation, constituents, and natural resources. “Risk management is the decision-making process whereby a policy or regulation is developed after a risk has been identified and is integrated with other issues including political, social, historical, and economic factors” (Zondi, 2000). In South Africa, environmental risk (i. e. risks associated with environmental damage and compliance) in waste management is currently considered {{in the setting of}} standards for landfill siting, design and water quality monitoring. It is the author’s opinion that this current approach has been poorly managed because potential sources of major environmental liability have not been identified and quantified (DWAF, 1998). Environmental liability is defined as the obligation to compensate or restore the environmental damage caused by the past, use, release, or threatened release of a particular substance; or by other activities that adversely affect the environment and/or human health (ICMA, 2001). The author looks at a case study of a landfill in Johannesburg highlighting their implementation of the water quality monitoring plan and proposes that the monitoring plan be integrated into a proposed environmental liability and risk management approach to managing ground water pollution from landfill sites. As not every landfill {{is the same as the}} other, a comprehensive analysis as stated in the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) Minimum Requirements (1998) is used to gather a list of relevant parameters for that landfill. The comprehensive analysis constitutes macro-constituents and all other constituents likely to be present in quantities higher than the normal background values or to contaminate the groundwater storage (aquifer) in the future. Once done, the landfill operator can then discuss with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) on how to prioritise the parameters. They would also decide which parameters are to be used for the regular indicator analysis when monitoring because of cost reasons. All the parameters above background value are to be used as environmental liability parameters for that landfill site. The indicator analysis constitutes measurement of the most likely parameters that would, at an early stage, indicate the possibility of groundwater pollution. It is to be used in the regular monitoring exercises at the landfill by the operator. If an indicator parameter exceeds standards, a full comprehensive analysis must be performed and reported to DEAT. Each environmental liability parameter will be assigned a penalty charge and weight depending on a number of factors including: • Location of the landfill i. e. distance to acquifer and GW level • Geology of area • Type of aquifer • Type of landfill i. e. General of Hazardous • Risk level of that parameter to human health i. e. Health Risk Assessment The author proposes the introduction of an environmental liability costs fund with a compulsory monthly fee, which will be set up by both the landfill operator and the relevant government department. The water quality monitoring protocol will not differ much from the present structure. If pollution is shown during detection monitoring and a further detailed investigation indicates that exposure is higher than allowable limits, then a combined environmental liability penalty will be evaluated and the monetary value will be charged into the landfill operator’s account in the liability costs fund, although the landfill operator and DEAT can decide to use another method to determine the environmental liability e. g. liability <b>insurance</b> <b>assessors.</b> If the penalty required exceeds what has been accumulated in the liability fund account, then the difference will be demanded directly from the landfill operator. If the quarterly monitoring reports compiled by the operators show no mitigation claims into the liability find then the money accumulates in their account and a certain percentage will be paid back to the landfill operator as an incentive...|$|R

50|$|On celebration day the Minister {{is still}} worried. Spottiswood {{tells him to}} stop worrying: she will have the sixth form girls take some suggestive {{pictures}} with the Ministry men, and agrees {{when he says that}} would be blackmail. Harry, with the intention of demanding more than the offered reward, calls Edward Noakes (Colin Gordon), the <b>insurance</b> <b>assessor</b> for the robbery, claims to know where the loot is, and offers to meet Noakes. The Parkmoor Catering Co., staffed by the gang, arrives at St. Trinian's and, as a decoy, set up the catering end of their mission. Harry, disguised, meets Noakes, but someone recognizes him, and Noakes leaves. At St. Trinian's Alfred, using a Polaroid camera that the boss has converted into a two-way radio is told that Noakes has been sighted nearby talking with an unknown man, and must be eliminated if he comes to the school. The boss sends Alfred a photo of Noakes for identification. Harry phones the police to claim the reward, but his claim is ignored. At the lunch, one of the girls recognizes Gilbert as someone who used to be at the pub with her father, but thinks no further about this. On the dais, the Minister hears some rumbling under the stage, which, Spottiswood explains, are the three Ministry men blundering around in the cellar. After lunch, as everyone goes outdoors, Alfred finds that some girl has taken his disguised radio transmitter. Backstage, the gang pries open the floorboards and begin to retrieve the loot. Outdoors, it soon begins to rain and everyone goes inside again. As the Morris Dancing (The Westminster Morris Men) takes place on stage, the gang continues to retrieve the loot. When the lead dancer notices the gang backstage, Alfred takes his place until the gang has finished retrieving the money, and they all leave in the catering truck. Meanwhile, three girls bring Alfred's radio apparatus to Harry and turn it on. The boss, thinking Alfred has contacted him, explains that the gang must eliminate the unknown man who had been with Noakes, and transmits a photo of Harry. When one of the girls tells Harry that she had recognized one of the waiters, Harry realizes the caterers are the thieves. Some of the girls go to the ballroom to catch the gang, and one of them tells Spottiswood about the disguised gang. Harry then mobilizes the girls to chase and capture them. Now Noakes calls the police and tells them the stolen money has just left St. Trinian’s. Some police head for school, and others to the local train stations. When Harry finds the train with the loot getting away, he goes to the signal box and throws a lever engaging a stop sign; while the train is stopped two girls unhitch the van with the loot. When Harry disengages the stop sign, the crooks take off, use an extra lever they brought along to switch onto the line which will take them to the boat, disengage the switch, and hide the lever by throwing it in a nearby waterhole. Then they realize the van is missing, and are forced to waste time finding the lever to throw the switch, while a large group of girls, who have taken over a train and followed the gang, annex the van, and head back to the station. Finally, the gang throws the switch and chases the girls. At a different station, the police commandeer a train and, thinking they are behind the two trains, take off in pursuit, only to realize they are in front of the two trains, and reverse direction, as do the other trains. Eventually, the girls shunt the gang, followed by the police, into a station where they are blocked by a stopped train, and the police capture the gang except for Alfred. Meanwhile, the girls have switched to a different track and take off in the opposite direction and stop at Pudham, where they are found by other policemen and credited with returning the loot and earning the reward.|$|E
