5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Zell Miller's {{career as}} a U.S. Senator he showed {{increasing}} support for Republicans and increasing criticism of Democrats, leading some to question whether his fellow <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{had given him a}} lukewarm reception. However, given his beginnings as a conservative southern Democrat, it is likely he found his views drastically different from the more liberal ideology of the national party.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{several days}} considering {{how to respond}} to the bill, Truman vetoed Taft–Hartley with a strong message to Congress. Truman had expressed no opinion on the bill prior to his veto message. The committees considering the bill had requested suggestions from the Truman administration, but did not receive any. With the administration taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. A clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> split evenly, 21–21.|$|E

25|$|They {{convinced}} Lieutenant Governor Mahlon Manson {{to resign}} from office, thereby removing anyone to easily take over the governorship should Gray have to resign. They used the issue to prevent his name from being entered as a candidate. Gray {{decided to have a}} Lieutenant Governor elected in the mid-term election to fill the seat, removing the issue, and allowing him to resign and accept the candidacy. The election was held and Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected. The <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> refused to accept the election, and declared it unconstitutional and elected Democrat Alonzo Green Smith to serve as Lieutenant Governor. The Senate Republicans were furious and began making a commotion in the opening prayer of the session. They went ahead and had Robertson sworn in but the Democrats filed a court suit to prevent him from being seated.|$|E

500|$|One {{beneficiary}} of Tilden's {{departure from the}} scene was Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware. Bayard was the scion of an old political family in Delaware and had represented his state in the United States Senate since 1869. [...] As one of a relative handful of conservative <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> at the time, Bayard began his career opposing vigorously, if ineffectively, the Republican majority's plans for the Reconstruction of the Southern states after the Civil War. Like Tilden, Bayard supported the gold standard and {{had a reputation for}} honesty. At the 1876 convention, Bayard had placed a distant fifth in the balloting, but supported Tilden's cause in the general election, speaking on his behalf around the country. The political friendship between the two quickly soured in the election's aftermath as Bayard supported the Electoral Commission and Tilden opposed it. Bayard believed the commission was the only alternative to civil war, and served as one of the Democratic members; Tilden took this as a personal betrayal.|$|E
2500|$|On February 3, 2009, President Obama {{nominated}} New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican.

2500|$|Pro-business conservatives {{gained control}} of Congress in 1946, and in 1947 passed the Taft-Hartley Act, drafted by Senator Robert A. Taft. President Truman vetoed it but the Conservative {{coalition}} overrode the veto. The veto override had considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> The law, which is still in effect, banned union contributions to political candidates, restricted the power of unions to call strikes that [...] "threatened national security," [...] and forced the expulsion of Communist union leaders (the Supreme Court found the anticommunist provision to be unconstitutional, {{and it is no}} longer in force). The unions campaigned vigorously for years to repeal the law but failed. During the late 1950s, the Landrum Griffin Act of 1959 passed in the wake of Congressional investigations of corruption and undemocratic internal politics in the Teamsters and other unions.|$|E
2500|$|Crist's {{stance on}} {{abortion}} has been unclear at times. In 1995, while in Florida Senate, Crist joined with two <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Health Care Committee in voting against {{a proposal for}} a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion, resulting in a 3-3 tie vote and the defeat of the bill. In 1998, while running for the U.S. Senate, Crist wrote in a Tampa Bay Times questionnaire that [...] "I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." [...] Crist said in a debate that year that he did not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. In 2006, while running for governor, Crist said that he did not support overturning Roe v. Wade and opposed a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion.|$|E
