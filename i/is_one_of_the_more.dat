Apart from the video game, Tracer has also made appearances in related animated media, and the Overwatch digital comic series. In her comic debut, she was revealed as a lesbian, a depiction that was met with positive reception from media outlets and players alike.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> basal genera, with only Amphicoelias and {{possibly}} a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus {{is also in the}} subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was reclassified as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case {{was the first time}} the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5|$|The Palazzo Zacco <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo {{was built in the}} second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} only Mario at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, {{the player}} will gain {{a party of}} five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time. Mario is always in the player's party, but the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has {{a unique set of}} attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> innovative features of gameplay, becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs.|$|E
