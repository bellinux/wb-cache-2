[...] McKinley needed to have Hanna appointed to the Senate so Senator Sherman was moved up. [...] Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley {{did not believe the}} rumors. Nevertheless, McKinley sent his cousin, William McKinley Osborne, to have dinner with the 73-year-old senator; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever.

Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E

At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society.
