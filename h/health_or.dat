5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the <b>health</b> <b>or</b> production of these animals.|$|E

5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is {{some degree of}} serotiny, that is, it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor <b>health</b> <b>or</b> dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E

Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E

5|$|Home Health Aide: The home <b>health,</b> <b>or</b> hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create <b>health</b> <b>or</b> safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E

5|$|In 85, Agricola was {{recalled}} to Rome by Domitian, {{having served}} {{for more than}} six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era. Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill <b>health</b> <b>or,</b> as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system {{that is used to}} increase the character's maximum <b>health</b> <b>or</b> Card Points, or to learn a new skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts.

Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's <b>health</b> <b>or</b> extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg and Kalākaua often held long {{conversations and}} enjoyed {{drinking}} alcohol together; Rosenberg told the king Bible stories and {{encouraged him to}} revive traditional Hawaiian religion, an idea that fascinated Kalākaua but angered his political rivals. In June 1887, Rosenberg returned to California, possibly owing to poor <b>health</b> <b>or</b> fear of unrest in Hawaii; a short time after arriving in San Francisco, he died in a local hospital. Soon after his departure from Hawaii, the June 1887 Constitution—which curtailed royal power—was forced upon Kalākaua. A Torah scroll and yad presented to the king by Rosenberg remained in the royal collection. These artifacts were later exhibited with other royal treasures and eventually donated to Temple Emanu-El in Honolulu.|$|E
