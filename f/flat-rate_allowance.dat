5000|$|At sea aboard naval vessels, messing {{is still}} separate, with E-6 and below {{utilizing}} the ship's mess decks, E-7 through E-9 utilizing the ship's CPO Mess, and commissioned officers {{being part of}} the wardroom. Certain large vessels (e.g., aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships) may also include a First Class Mess for E-6, typically a separate dining area adjacent to the mess decks. This is considered a chance for future CPOs to learn how {{to be a part of}} a mess before they enter the CPO Mess, often called by the sobriquet of [...] "goat locker." [...] Enlisted personnel normally receive all meals at what appears to be no cost, but in fact subsidize their meals through forfeiture of their Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), also called [...] "commuted rations," [...] although Chief Petty Officers may also have a mess [...] "buy in" [...] and/or monthly mess bill equivalent to the BAS. For those ships with embarked Marine Corps personnel, staff noncommissioned officers in the grades of E-7, E-8 and E-9 will also be part of the CPO Mess. Commissioned Officers retain their BAS, a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowance</b> much smaller than the graduated by rank amount paid out to enlisted personnel; however, they must pay for all of their meals while afloat out of pocket. This usually entails a mess [...] "buy in" [...] as a member of the officers' mess and will typically have either a monthly mess bill or will purchase meals via some sort of debit card.|$|E
40|$|Maria Miller’s {{resignation}} {{was brought}} about by yet another expenses scandal. However, the real scandal, argues Imke Henkel, is that politicians are not being paid adequately for their work and instead {{have to go through}} bureaucratic hoops in order to claim expenses. The entire expenses claims system should be reformed in-line with the German and French <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowance</b> so as to avoid any future issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} introduce a radical reform of Housing Benefit for private tenants. Known as the Local Housing Allowance (LHA), the new scheme has been piloted over a two year period prior to a planned national roll-out. The radical feature of the LHA is that, unlike the present Housing Benefit (HB) scheme, entitlement is no longer based on the tenant's rent. Instead, within each local market area, there is a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowance</b> for all privately rented claimants, which varies only by household size and composition. Yet most of the controversy has focused, not {{on the design of}} the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowance,</b> but on the associated proposal to pay it to claimants rather than to their landlords. Local authorities will only be able to pay the LHA to the landlord if they consider that the tenant is 'vulnerable' and incapable of managing their financial affairs, is unlikely to pay their rent or has accrued eight weeks' rent arrears. This report examines HB claimants' understanding, attitudes and experiences of the two different payment methods, that is, payment to the claimant and payment to the landlord. It explores this issue in the context of claimants' attitudes towards their liability to pay the rent and how rent payment fits into their household budgeting more generally...|$|E
25|$|A law of 9 June 1975 {{increased}} the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration of benefits. A law of 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements for pensioners. The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowances.</b> A law of 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. On 29 April 1976, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to civil servants.|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong’s {{vigorous}} economy, high relative {{wealth and}} savings, and strong family networks have traditionally belied {{the establishment of}} a universal public old-age income support scheme. At best, the government has addressed social security for the elderly through a system of non-contributory safety nets under the Social Welfare Department: The Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme – This is a means-tested scheme designed to raise the income of elderly individuals and others in need. The Social Security Allowance Scheme (SSAS) – The SSAS is a non-means-tested scheme that provides <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowances</b> for all elderly individuals 1 and people with severe disabilities. Monthly benefits amount to HK $ 675 for those aged 70 and over and HK $ 595 for those aged 65 - 69. This scheme and the CSSA are mutually exclusive. Other Schemes – Three non-means-tested schemes (Criminal and Law Enforcement Injuries Compensation Scheme, the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme and Emergency Relief) provide cash and material assistance to victims of injuries from various causes. Some employers have voluntarily established retirement schemes as a means of attracting an...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{detailed}} analysis of costs and prices of rehabilitation work carried out on some of the Federal University of Technology, Minna buildings on two of its campuses {{in the last quarter of}} 2006. Lecturers of the built-environment faculties were the supervising consultants. The aim was to verify the merits of using in-house consultants in place of the conventional ones. Method used in data collection was historical- collecting from the archives of the Task-force (consultants) and percentages was the analytical tool employed. Figures of savings made for the client by the consultants from both the pre-contract estimates and the various contractors’ variation claims were collated and analyzed. It was discovered that savings of between 9 and 43 percents were made on the cost of each of the contracts (lots), culminating in savings of about N 9 million. The normal consultancy fee was waived for a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>allowance</b> The further patronage of this type of in-house consultants was recommended for tertiary institutions’ infrastructural facilities rehabilitation work...|$|E
2500|$|The widow's earning {{rule was}} also abolished, while {{a range of}} new social {{benefits}} was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who {{were considered to be}} unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a [...] "long term" [...] allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced. From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.” Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity, unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of <b>flat-rate</b> family <b>allowances</b> with an earnings-related scheme in 1968. From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.|$|R

From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks. Increases were made in pensions and other benefits during Wilson's first year in office that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point. Social security benefits were markedly increased during Wilson's first two years in office, as characterised by a budget passed in the final quarter of 1964 which raised the standard benefit rates for old age, sickness and invalidity by 18.5%. In 1965, the government increased the national assistance rate to a higher level relative to earnings, and via annual adjustments, broadly maintained the rate at between 19% and 20% of gross industrial earnings until the start of 1970. In the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the First Wilson Government, pensions went up by 23% in real terms, supplementary benefits by 26% in real terms, and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153% in real terms (largely {{as a result of the}} introduction of earnings-related benefits in 1967).|$|R
