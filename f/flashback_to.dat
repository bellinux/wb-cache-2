5|$|Andrea Martin {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Apu's mother, recording her part in New York City. She {{wanted to get the}} voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> Apu's childhood, the animators made sure not to show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{continued}} at Fox (where {{most of the}} shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana. Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.

The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap.

5|$|One episode {{includes}} a <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> San Carlos de Bariloche, {{the location of}} the graduation trip (an Argentine prom tradition). Pablo Echarri made a guest appearance as the trip's coordinator, and fans of the show were selected in an internet competition to join the trip to Bariloche as extras. Another flashback features the Pumper Nic fast-food restaurant and a guest appearance by sportswriter Juan Pablo Varsky. Not all flashbacks are focused on the 1980s or high school; some are events from a character's adolescence, such as the shotgun wedding of María Laura and Pablo or her 15th birthday.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E

At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club.

5|$|Many filmed scenes remain unused, {{even in the}} Extended Editions. Promotional {{material}} for The Fellowship of the Ring contained an attack by Orcs from Moria on Lothlórien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at Parth Galen and an extended Council of Elrond, and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river Anduin by an Uruk-hai. The major cut to The Two Towers featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothlórien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep. This scene, and a <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.|$|E

Her mother tries to stop her from going out, but Emily escapes and is struck by a car. The trauma triggers the premature birth of John (as an adult portrayed by Terry O'Quinn).

The existence of Mittelos Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high-school student.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, Marvel {{announced}} that Daredevil would be filmed in New York City. In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, {{stating that the}} show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell’s Kitchen, in addition to sound stage work. Loeb said that Daredevil would begin filming in July 2014, and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month. It filmed under the working title Bluff, on a $56 million budget.

5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a <b>flashback</b> <b>to</b> the {{previous}} day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires.
